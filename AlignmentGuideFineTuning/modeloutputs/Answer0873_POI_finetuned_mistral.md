ðŸŸ¥ T (Task) â€“ What You Need to Do

Create a self-contained function block in IEC 61131-3 Structured Text that performs linear interpolation between two known data points.

â¸»

ðŸŸ© A (Action) â€“ How to Do It
	1.	Define a function block named LinearInterpolation with the following REAL inputs:
	â€¢	X1, Y1: First known point
	â€¢	X2, Y2: Second known point
	â€¢	X: The value at which interpolation should occur
	2.	Compute the interpolated output Y using the formula:
Y := Y1 + \frac{(X - X1) \times (Y2 - Y1)}{(X2 - X1)}
Add a conditional check to avoid division by zero:
IF X2 <> X1 THEN
    Y := Y1 + ((X - X1) * (Y2 - Y1)) / (X2 - X1);
ELSE
    Y := Y1; // Or use fallback logic
END_IF;
3.	Include inline comments that explain each part of the calculation.
	4.	Address floating-point rounding and real-time scan cycle constraints, ensuring the block runs efficiently in control applications.

ðŸŸ¦ G (Goal) â€“ What You Want to Achieve

Provide a reusable, lightweight, and accurate function block for linear interpolation that supports applications like:
	â€¢	Sensor signal scaling
	â€¢	Analog-to-digital conversion mapping
	â€¢	Dynamic setpoint adjustments

The function block must ensure safe, predictable results and be suitable for deployment in real-time PLC environments.
