### Intent:
**Intent Summary:**  
Create a reusable IEC 61131-3 function block to multiply two 4x4 matrices using structured text, with detailed comments and analysis of computational limitations for industrial control applications like robotics or motion systems.  

*(Focus: Implementation + scalability constraints for PLCs)*

### Prompt:
**Matrix Multiplication:**

Develop a self-contained function block in IEC 61131-3 to perform multiplication of two 4x4 matrices. Ensure that the implementation adheres to the standards of structured text programming and includes detailed comments explaining each part of the process. Discuss the computational complexity and potential limitations when scaling this approach to larger matrices.

ðŸŸ© T (Task) â€“ What You Need to Do

Create a self-contained function block named MatrixMultiply4x4 that:
	â€¢	Performs multiplication of two 4Ã—4 matrices
	â€¢	Accepts two inputs:
	â€¢	MatrixA: ARRAY[1..4, 1..4] OF REAL
	â€¢	MatrixB: ARRAY[1..4, 1..4] OF REAL
	â€¢	Returns:
	â€¢	MatrixC: ARRAY[1..4, 1..4] OF REAL, the resulting matrix product
	â€¢	Implements standard matrix multiplication logic using triple nested FOR loops
	â€¢	Includes detailed inline comments explaining each step of the multiplication process, including:
	â€¢	Iteration over rows and columns
	â€¢	Inner loop to compute dot products
	â€¢	Resetting the output element before summing products
	â€¢	Follows IEC 61131-3 structured text conventions for clarity, reusability, and compatibility
	â€¢	Discusses limitations:
	â€¢	Computational complexity: O(nÂ³), not scalable for large matrices on PLCs
	â€¢	Real-time constraints: impact of loop depth on scan cycle time
	â€¢	Memory usage: array-based implementation must be fixed and pre-sized

    FOR j := 1 TO 4 DO
        MatrixC[i,j] := 0;
        FOR k := 1 TO 4 DO
            MatrixC[i,j] := MatrixC[i,j] + MatrixA[i,k] * MatrixB[k,j];
        END_FOR;
    END_FOR;
END_FOR;
	â€¢	Commented explanation for each block of code
	â€¢	A short note on real-world applications, such as using the block to perform coordinate frame transformations or chaining 3D transformation matrices in robotic arms
