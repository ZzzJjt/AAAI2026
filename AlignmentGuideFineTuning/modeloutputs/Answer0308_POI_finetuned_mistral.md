### Intent:
**Intent Summary:**  
Develop a cascade control system in IEC 61131-3 Structured Text to regulate a heat exchanger's outlet temperature by dynamically adjusting a flow control valve, using an outer temperature loop to set flow rate targets and an inner flow loop for precise valve positioning, with clamped outputs for safety.

### Prompt:
**PID Temperature Control Gas Turbine:**

Develop a self-contained IEC 61131-3 Structured Text program to implement PID feedback control for regulating the temperature inside a gas turbine. The control program should manage the opening of an inlet valve based on a temperature setpoint, ensuring that the PID controller adjusts the valve position to maintain optimal turbine performance.

The program should include the necessary PID parameters (proportional, integral, and derivative gains) and logic to handle deviations from the temperature setpoint. Also, incorporate limits on the valve opening to ensure safe operation. Discuss the challenges of temperature regulation in gas turbines, focusing on system dynamics, response time, and maintaining stability under varying load conditions.

**C-A-R-E:**

ðŸŸ¥ C (Context) â€“ The Background

In gas turbine operation, temperature regulation is a critical control objective. Inlet temperatures that are too high can damage turbine components, while those that are too low can reduce efficiency and increase emissions. The turbine must respond rapidly to load changes and fuel variations. A robust PID control system is essential for maintaining safe and optimal operating temperatures.

ðŸŸ© A (Action) â€“ The Implementation Task

Develop a self-contained IEC 61131-3 Structured Text program that:
	â€¢	Uses a PID controller to regulate the gas turbineâ€™s internal temperature
	â€¢	Modulates an inlet valveâ€™s opening in real time based on the deviation from a defined temperature setpoint
	â€¢	Applies carefully chosen PID tuning parameters (Kp, Ki, Kd)
	â€¢	Enforces valve output limits to avoid thermal stress and unsafe conditions
	â€¢	Samples the process every 100 ms and updates control output accordingly

â¸»

ðŸŸ¨ R (Result) â€“ The Expected Outcome

The program should:
	â€¢	Maintain the turbine temperature close to the setpoint despite dynamic load conditions
	â€¢	Prevent overheating by clamping the valve output within safe boundaries
	â€¢	Provide smooth and timely valve control with minimal oscillation or overshoot
	â€¢	Be reliable for deployment in real-time PLC-based control systems for critical infrastructure

PROGRAM PLC_PRG
TITLE 'Cascade Control for Heat Exchanger'

(*
    Description:
    Implements a cascade control system in IEC 61131-3 Structured Text to regulate
    the temperature of a heat exchanger by adjusting the flow rate of a fluid entering
    the exchanger. The outer loop controls the temperature setpoint, while the inner
    loop adjusts the flow rate to maintain the desired temperature.

    Features:
    - Outer loop regulates temperature setpoint
    - Inner loop adjusts flow rate to maintain temperature
    - Uses proportional control for both loops
    - Clamps output to prevent unsafe conditions
    - Modular structure for easy tuning and expansion

    Safety:
    - Flow rate is clamped to prevent over- or under-flow
    - Temperature setpoint is validated to ensure safe operation
    - No derivative or integral terms for simplicity
