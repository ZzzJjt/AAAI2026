### Intent:
**Intent Summary:**  
Create an OPC UA subscription function block in C (using Open62541) wrapped in IEC 61131-3 Structured Text to dynamically manage real-time data subscriptions from PLCs, with adjustable intervals, status feedback, and error handling.  

*(Focus: Bridging C-based OPC UA functionality into PLC logic for scalable industrial communication.)*

### Prompt:
**OPC UA Subscription Creation Using Open62541 and IEC 61131-3 Structured Text:**

Develop a C function block for OPC UA subscription creation using the Open62541 library, which will be wrapped in IEC 61131-3 structured text code. The function block receives a Connection Handle as a DWORD and has the following inputs: an executed flag (BOOL), a priority (BYTE), and a timeout (TIME). As outputs, it provides three status flags (Done, Busy, Error) along with two DWORD outputs (ErrorID, SubscriptionHdl). The function block also includes an IN/OUT variable PublishingInterval (type TIME), which allows dynamic adjustment of the subscription interval.

In your explanation, describe how this C function block can be wrapped inside IEC 61131-3 structured text code, highlighting the integration steps and providing an example of how to call the function block within an ST program. Discuss error handling, subscription management, and real-time communication with OPC UA servers.

**R-I-S-E:**

ðŸŸ¥ R (Role) â€“ Your Role

Act as an automation engineer integrating C-based OPC UA functionality into an IEC 61131-3 environment to enable real-time subscription handling in PLC programs.

â¸»

ðŸŸ© I (Input) â€“ What Youâ€™re Given

You are developing a C function block using the open62541 OPC UA client library. This function block must support OPC UA subscription creation, and be callable from an IEC 61131-3 Structured Text (ST) environment. The function block interface includes:

Inputs:
	â€¢	Execute (BOOL): Initiates the subscription
	â€¢	ConnectionHdl (DWORD): OPC UA session handle
	â€¢	Priority (BYTE): Subscription priority
	â€¢	Timeout (TIME): Max wait time for response
	â€¢	PublishingInterval (IN/OUT, TIME): Interval for data updates (adjustable at runtime)

Outputs:
	â€¢	Done (BOOL): Indicates successful subscription
	â€¢	Busy (BOOL): Operation in progress
	â€¢	Error (BOOL): Subscription failed
	â€¢	ErrorID (DWORD): Diagnostic error code
	â€¢	SubscriptionHdl (DWORD): Output handle for managing the subscription

â¸»

ðŸŸ§ S (Steps) â€“ What to Do
	1.	Write the C function block using open62541 to create a subscription, configure its priority and publishing interval, and return a handle to the caller.
	2.	Wrap the C code into a callable module or external function that is accessible from the ST environment.
	3.	Implement an ST function block wrapper that triggers the C function on a rising edge of Execute, tracks the connection state using Busy, and sets Done or Error flags upon completion.
	4.	Ensure robust error handling, including timeouts, invalid handles, and communication errors, and propagate error codes back to the ST layer via ErrorID.
	5.	Document the integration, showing how to instantiate and use the function block within a PLC cycle.

â¸»

ðŸŸ¦ E (Expectation) â€“ What Success Looks Like

The final solution enables PLC programs to reliably create and manage OPC UA subscriptions in real time. The PublishingInterval can be adjusted dynamically, and the PLC receives clear status feedback on the subscription state. This bridges modern OPC UA capabilities with deterministic PLC control logic, enabling high-performance data communication and system scalability.

ðŸŸ¥ Rï¼ˆRoleï¼‰

Act as an automation engineer developing C-based OPC UA subscription functionality to integrate with IEC 61131-3 Structured Text environments.

â¸»

ðŸŸ© Iï¼ˆInputï¼‰

You are tasked with creating a C function block using the open62541 library to manage OPC UA subscriptions. The function block receives a Connection Handle as a DWORD and has the following inputs:
	â€¢	Execute (BOOL) â€“ triggers the subscription creation
	â€¢	Priority (BYTE) â€“ sets the priority of the subscription
	â€¢	Timeout (TIME) â€“ maximum time to wait for a response
	â€¢	PublishingInterval (IN/OUT, TIME) â€“ the interval at which data is published (can be dynamically adjusted)
The function block outputs:
	â€¢	Done (BOOL) â€“ subscription creation is complete
	â€¢	Busy (BOOL) â€“ the subscription creation process is currently running
	â€¢	Error (BOOL) â€“ an error occurred during subscription creation
	â€¢	ErrorID (DWORD) â€“ an error code if an error occurred
	â€¢	SubscriptionHdl (DWORD) â€“ a handle to the created subscription, which can be used for further management

â¸»

ðŸŸ§ Sï¼ˆStepsï¼‰

	1.	Create a C function block using the open62541 library to establish an OPC UA subscription with the specified priority and interval. Include logic to handle the connection, error checking, and timeout management.
	2.	Implement a C function that wraps the C function block, allowing it to be called from an IEC 61131-3 Structured Text environment. Ensure that the function blockâ€™s inputs and outputs are mapped properly.
	3.	Develop an IEC 61131-3 Structured Text function block that wraps the C function. This function block should:
	â€¢	Accept the Execute input to trigger the subscription creation
	â€¢	Track the Busy status of the C function block
	â€¢	Set the Done flag when the subscription is created
	â€¢	Set the Error flag if an error occurs
	â€¢	Provide the ErrorID for error diagnostics
	â€¢	Accept the PublishingInterval as an IN/OUT variable, allowing it to be dynamically adjusted
	4.	Implement error handling within the C function block to manage potential issues such as connection failures, timeout errors, and invalid handles. Ensure that these errors are appropriately mapped to the ErrorID output.
