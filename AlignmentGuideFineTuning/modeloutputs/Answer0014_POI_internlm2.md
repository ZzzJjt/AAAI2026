Use MATLAB to build a dynamic model of aircraft motion, integrate it with an MPC formulation, and encode constraints and performance objectives. Simulate various flight scenarios to demonstrate how the MPC system maintains optimal trajectories even under changing environmental and operational conditions. Validate the system's performance against industry benchmarks and real-world data.
