**Spline Interpolation:**

Cubic spline interpolation is a method for approximating a smooth curve through a set of data points. It is particularly useful in applications where a smooth curve is desired, such as motion control or sensor smoothing. The spline is constructed by fitting a cubic polynomial to each segment between consecutive data points, ensuring a smooth transition between them.

The process of constructing a cubic spline involves several steps:

1. **Data Preprocessing:** The given data points (X, Y) are sorted in ascending order of X. This ensures that the spline is monotonically increasing, which is a requirement for the algorithm to work correctly.

2. **Spline Coefficient Calculation:** For each segment between consecutive data points, the cubic spline coefficients (A, B, C, D) are calculated using the following formulas:

   A[i] = Y[i]
   B[i] = 3 * (Y[i+1] - Y[i]) / (X[i+1] - X[i])
   C[i] = 3 * (Y[i] - Y[i+1]) / (X[i] - X[i+1])
   D[i] = Y[i+1] - Y[i] - B[i] * (X[i+1] - X[i]) - C[i] * (X[i] - X[i+1])

   These coefficients are used to evaluate the spline at any x-value within the segment.

3. **Spline Evaluation:** To interpolate a value at a given x-value (TargetX), the function block identifies the correct interval for TargetX between X[i] and X[i+1]. It then uses the precomputed spline coefficients to evaluate the spline at TargetX:

   InterpolatedY = A[i] + B[i](x - X[i]) + C[i](x - X[i])^2 + D[i](x - X[i])^3

   This process is repeated for each segment until the correct interpolated value is found.

4. **Boundary Conditions:** The function block should handle boundary conditions and extrapolation safely. This can be achieved by checking if TargetX is within the range of X[i] and X[i+1]. If it is not, the function block can either return the nearest boundary value or extrapolate the spline beyond the given data points.
