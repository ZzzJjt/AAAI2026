### Intent:
**Intent Summary:**  
Develop a structured text function block to register/deregister CAN Open IDs (COBIDs) with status tracking, ensuring no duplicates and handling buffer management.

### Prompt:
**IO-Link Data Acquisition Using 61131-3 Structured Text:**

Develop a function block in structured text (ST) based on IEC 61131 standards to read five values from a remote IO-Link master. The function block should handle communication with the IO-Link master, retrieve the required process data, and provide the status of each read operation. Discuss the methodology used for error checking, status reporting, and handling of potential communication issues between the IO-Link master and the connected devices.

**C-A-R-E:**

ðŸŸ¥ C (Context) â€“ The Background

IO-Link is widely used in modern industrial systems to connect sensors and actuators to controllers via standardized communication. However, without structured data acquisition logic, communication failures, missing data, or undetected errors can lead to unreliable operation and difficult troubleshooting.

ðŸŸ© A (Action) â€“ The Implementation Task

Develop a function block in IEC 61131-3 Structured Text (ST) that reads five process values from a remote IO-Link master. The block should handle communication requests, retrieve each value reliably, and return a status for every read operation. The function block must include error checking logic to detect communication failures and respond appropriately, such as retrying or flagging an error.

ðŸŸ¨ R (Result) â€“ The Expected Outcome

The function block enables accurate and transparent IO-Link data acquisition, ensures that each value read is validated and confirmed, and provides the controller with both the data and its communication status. This enhances diagnostics, improves system robustness, and reduces downtime due to silent failures or corrupted reads.

ðŸŸ¦ E (Example) â€“ A Practical Use Case

For example, when the controller requests five sensor values from an IO-Link master, the function block attempts to read each one in sequence. If one read fails due to a timeout or device fault, the function block sets an error status for that value while successfully delivering the other four. The controller can then take appropriate actionsâ€”such as issuing a retry, generating an alarm, or isolating the faulty device.

(* Function Block: CANOpen_Register_COBID
   Purpose: Registers/Deregisters CAN Open IDs (COBIDs) with status tracking
   Inputs:
   - COBID : CAN Open ID to register or deregister
   - Register : BOOL to enable registration
   - Status : BOOL to track registration status
   Outputs:
   - Status : BOOL to indicate registration success or failure
   - Error : BOOL to indicate error conditions
   - ErrorCode : INT to provide error code (0 = success, 1 = duplicate, 2 = timeout, 3 = invalid, 4 = device fault)
   Methods:
   - Registers COBID if Register = TRUE and no duplicates
   - Updates Status and Error if registration fails
   - Sets ErrorCode to 1 if COBID already registered
   - Sets ErrorCode to 2 if timeout occurs
   - Sets ErrorCode to 3 if COBID is invalid
   - Sets ErrorCode to 4 if device fault is detected
   - Ensures safe and deterministic behavior
