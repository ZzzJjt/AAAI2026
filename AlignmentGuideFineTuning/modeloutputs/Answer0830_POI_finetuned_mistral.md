### Intent:
The task is to develop a Modbus TCP server function block in IEC 61131-3 Structured Text that handles multiple client connections, processes various Modbus function codes (read/write operations), and manages communication timeouts with proper error handling.

### Prompt:
**Profibus DPV1 Diagnostics Using 61131-3 Structured Text:**

Develop a self-contained 61131-3 structured text program to retrieve diagnostic data from a Profibus device using the Profibus DPV1 protocol. The program should implement a CASE statement to handle 10 specific diagnostic data types, such as communication errors, device status, and parameter faults. Each diagnostic type should be mapped to a concrete data type, ensuring that the retrieved information is processed accurately and efficiently. Discuss the logic behind handling these diagnostic data types, including error detection and fault handling mechanisms, to ensure robust communication with the Profibus device.

**T-A-G:**

ðŸŸ¥ T (Task) â€“ What You Need to Do

Develop a self-contained IEC 61131-3 Structured Text (ST) program to retrieve and interpret diagnostic data from a Profibus DPV1 device.

â¸»

ðŸŸ© A (Action) â€“ How to Do It

Use a CASE statement to process 10 distinct diagnostic data types, such as:
	â€¢	Communication errors
	â€¢	Device status indicators
	â€¢	Parameter faults
	â€¢	Configuration issues
	â€¢	Power supply problems
	â€¢	Hardware failures
	â€¢	Bus interruptions
	â€¢	Watchdog timeouts
	â€¢	Temperature alerts
	â€¢	Manufacturer-specific diagnostics

For each case, map the diagnostic content to well-typed variables or structures, and set appropriate status and error flags. Implement logic for initiating diagnostic requests, validating responses, and handling unsupported or invalid data. Include fault detection and reporting using general-purpose outputs like Error, ErrorID, and Done.

â¸»

ðŸŸ¦ G (Goal) â€“ What You Want to Achieve

Enable structured, accurate, and real-time handling of detailed Profibus DPV1 diagnostics within a PLC environment. This allows for faster troubleshooting, proactive maintenance, and improved system transparencyâ€”ensuring reliable industrial communication and device health monitoring.
