ðŸŸ© A (Action) â€“ How the Code Works
	1.	Primary Loop â€“ Pressure Control
	â€¢	Measures the current pressure PV1 using ReadPressure()
	â€¢	Compares it to the setpoint SP1
	â€¢	Calculates the error and applies PID control (Kp1, Ki1, Kd1)
	â€¢	Outputs OP1, which becomes the flow setpoint (SP2) for the inner loop
	â€¢	Applies clamping (0.0 to 100.0) to keep OP1 within safe limits
	2.	Secondary Loop â€“ Flow Control
	â€¢	Measures the flow rate PV2 using ReadFlowRate()
	â€¢	Uses OP1 as the setpoint SP2
	â€¢	Calculates the error and applies a second PID controller (Kp2, Ki2, Kd2)
	â€¢	The output OP2 sets the valve position via SetValvePosition(OP2)
	â€¢	Also clamps OP2 within a safe range of 0.0 to 100.0
	3.	Timing
	â€¢	Uses a fixed sample time dt := t#100ms for all integral and derivative calculations

ðŸŸª R (Result) â€“ What You Should See or Observe
	â€¢	When the program is executed, it should control the pressure and flow rate of a vessel using cascade control, with the inner loop responding quickly to flow changes and the outer loop maintaining pressure stability.

**C-A-S-E:**

ðŸŸ¥ C (Context) â€“ The Situation

Cascade control is a widely used technique in process automation to improve control performance by separating fast response to disturbances from slow, steady-state control. In this example, a vesselâ€™s pressure is controlled by a primary loop, while the flow rate is managed by a secondary loop. The primary loop ensures pressure stability, while the secondary loop quickly adjusts the flow rate to maintain the desired pressure setpoint.

ðŸŸ© A (Action) â€“ The Action Taken

The provided IEC 61131-3 Structured Text program implements a cascade control system for managing a vesselâ€™s pressure and flow rate. The primary loop controls the pressure by comparing the measured pressure (PV1) to the setpoint (SP1) and applying a PID controller (Kp1, Ki1, Kd1) to generate the flow setpoint (OP1). The secondary loop then controls the flow rate by comparing the measured flow rate (PV2) to the flow setpoint (OP1) and applying another PID controller (Kp2, Ki2, Kd2) to generate the valve position (OP2). The program uses a fixed sample time (dt := t#100ms) for all integral and derivative calculations.

ðŸŸ¦ G (Goal) â€“ What You Set Out to Achieve

The goal of this program is to demonstrate how cascade control can be implemented in a self-contained IEC 61131-3 Structured Text program. The program should clearly show the separation of control loops, with the primary loop focusing on pressure stability and the secondary loop managing flow rate with fast response times. The use of PID control and clamping mechanisms ensures that the control outputs remain within safe operating ranges.

ðŸŸª R (Result) â€“ What Happened

When executed, the program will control the pressure and flow rate of a vessel using cascade control. The primary loop will maintain pressure stability by adjusting the flow setpoint (OP1) based on the measured pressure (PV1) and the setpoint (SP1). The secondary loop will then control the flow rate by adjusting
