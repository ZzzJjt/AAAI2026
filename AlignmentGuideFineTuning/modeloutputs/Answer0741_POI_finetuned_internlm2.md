### Intent:
**Intent Summary:**  
Develop an IEC 61131-3 Structured Text PLC program to control an automatic car wash station, ensuring safe operation by starting the wash only when a car is present and no humans are detected, immediately stopping and alarming on human intrusion, and maintaining safety interlocks until conditions are cleared.

### Prompt:
**Automatic Car Wash Station Control Using 61131-3 Structured Text:**

Write a PLC program in structured text (ST) according to IEC 61131-3 standards to control an automatic car wash station with a single wash bay. The system should use a sensor to detect the presence of a car. Once the car is detected and no human is present in the wash area, the system should initiate the car wash process. If a human is detected within the car wash area at any point, the station should immediately stop the wash process, trigger an alarm, and remain in a safe state until the area is clear.

**R-T-F:**

🟥 R (Role) – Your Role

You are a PLC automation engineer responsible for developing safe and responsive control logic for an automatic car wash station. Your work must comply with IEC 61131-3 Structured Text (ST) standards and prioritize both operational flow and human safety.

⸻

🟩 T (Task) – What You Need to Do

Create a Structured Text program that controls a single-bay automatic car wash with the following behavior:
	•	Use input sensors to detect:
	•	CarPresentSensor : BOOL — car detected inside the wash bay
	•	HumanDetectedSensor : BOOL — human presence detected in the wash zone
	•	Implement output logic to:
	•	WashActive : BOOL — TRUE when wash is running
	•	AlarmActive : BOOL — TRUE when a person is detected in a danger zone
	•	SafeToRun : BOOL — internal flag to allow or lock the start of a new wash cycle
	•	Core logic must:
	•	Start the wash only if a car is present, no human is detected, and the system is in a safe state
	•	Immediately stop the wash and raise an alarm if a human is detected at any time
	•	Lock out the wash system (SafeToRun := FALSE) until the area is clear and no cycle is active
	•	Reset SafeToRun only after the wash has stopped and the area is confirmed safe

⸻

🟧 F (Format) – Expected Output

You should deliver a complete and clear IEC 61131-3 Structured Text function block or program section, for example:
CarPresent := CarPresentSensor;
HumanDetected := HumanDetectedSensor;

IF HumanDetected THEN
    WashActive := FALSE;
    AlarmActive := TRUE;
    SafeToRun := FALSE;
ELSIF CarPresent AND NOT HumanDetected AND SafeToRun THEN
    WashActive := TRUE;
    AlarmActive := FALSE;
END_IF;

// Reset safety flag after conditions are met
IF NOT HumanDetected AND NOT WashActive THEN
    SafeToRun := TRUE;
END_IF;
Your final solution should:
	•	Be easy to read and maintain
	•	Prevent hazardous conditions through robust interlocks
	•	Be ready for integration with HMI systems, emergency stops, and actuator control

🟥 A (Action) – What You Should Do Next

Write a self-contained IEC 61131-3 Structured Text program block that controls the car wash station, ensuring safe operation by starting the wash only when a car is present and no humans are detected, and stopping immediately and raising an alarm if a human is detected. Your program should also include logic to lock out the wash system until the area is clear and no cycle is active, and to reset the safety flag after the wash has stopped and the area is confirmed safe.
**Automatic Car Wash Station Control:**

Write a self-contained IEC 61131-3 Structured Text program block to control an automatic car wash station with a single wash bay. The program should use input sensors to detect the presence of a car and the presence of a human in the wash area. The output logic should include a WashActive signal to indicate when the wash is running, an AlarmActive signal to indicate when a person is detected in a danger zone, and a SafeToRun signal to control the start of a new wash cycle. The core logic should ensure that the wash starts only when a car is present, no human is detected, and the system is in a safe state. It should also stop the wash immediately and raise an alarm if a human is detected at any time. The program should include logic to lock out the wash system until the area is clear and no cycle is active, and to reset the SafeToRun signal after the wash has stopped and the area is confirmed safe.
