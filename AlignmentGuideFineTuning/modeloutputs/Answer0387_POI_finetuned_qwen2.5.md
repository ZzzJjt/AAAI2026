### Intent:
**Intent Summary:**  
Create a text-based Piping and Instrumentation Diagram (P&ID) for a power plant steam-water cycle, detailing equipment, instrumentation, control loops with tag names, and piping flow paths in structured textual notation for design, documentation, and automation integration.  

**Code Generation Intent:**  
Generate a textual P&ID representation of a steam-water cycle with tagged instruments, control loops, and piping logic for non-graphical environments.

### Prompt:
**P-ID Steam Water Cycle:**

Create a P&I diagram in textual notation for a steam water cycle in a power plant. Include equipment, instrumentation, piping, and control loops. Provide concrete tag names.

**C-A-R-E:**

ðŸŸ¥ C (Context) â€“ Background Situation

In power plant engineering, the steam-water cycle is a critical process that involves feedwater supply, steam generation, energy transfer, and condensate recovery. Typically, this system is documented using graphical Piping and Instrumentation Diagrams (P&IDs). However, in environments where visual tools arenâ€™t availableâ€”such as early-stage design, textual documentation, or version-controlled environmentsâ€”engineers often rely on structured textual notation to convey the same information effectively.

ðŸŸ© A (Action) â€“ Task to Perform

Create a text-based P&ID for a steam-water cycle that includes:
	â€¢	Process equipment (e.g., boiler, steam drum, feedwater pump, condenser)
	â€¢	Instrumentation (e.g., pressure transmitters, level controllers, flow elements)
	â€¢	Control loops with concrete tag names (e.g., FT101, FCV102, LT103)
	â€¢	Piping flow paths clearly represented using arrows (-->) and structured indentation

Ensure the layout clearly communicates the relationship between instruments, control logic, and equipment within the system.

â¸»

ðŸŸ¨ R (Result) â€“ Expected Outcome

The result will be a readable, logically sequenced P&ID in textual format, suitable for:
	â€¢	Early-stage design discussions
	â€¢	Control narrative development
	â€¢	Integration with PLC or DCS logic
	â€¢	Documenting control loop structure for cross-disciplinary teams

It will serve as a bridge between process design and automation, even in environments where graphical diagrams are not practical.
