### Intent:
**Intent Summary:**  
Create a reusable Structured Text function block to read and process diagnostic data from a Profibus DP slave device, including status, error codes, and communication health, with robust error handling and state management.  

*(Focus: Profibus DP diagnostics, ST implementation, fault-tolerant communication)*

### Prompt:
**Profibus DP Diagnostics Using 61131-3 Structured Text:**

Develop a self-contained 61131-3 structured text function block to read diagnostic data from a Profibus DP slave device. The function block should handle communication with the Profibus DP slave and retrieve diagnostic information such as device status, error codes, and communication health. Provide an explanation of the key steps in processing the diagnostic data, including request initiation, data retrieval, and error handling mechanisms.

**R-T-F:**

ðŸŸ¥ R (Role) â€“ Your Role

Act as a PLC developer tasked with building diagnostic tools using IEC 61131-3 Structured Text for Profibus DP networks.

â¸»

ðŸŸ© T (Task) â€“ What You Need to Do

Develop a self-contained Structured Text (ST) function block that reads diagnostic data from a Profibus DP slave device. The block should:
	â€¢	Initiate diagnostic requests to the specified slave
	â€¢	Retrieve and interpret data such as device status, communication health, and error codes
	â€¢	Handle timeouts and communication failures
	â€¢	Output status indicators and parsed diagnostic information to the PLC program

â¸»

ðŸŸ§ F (Format) â€“ Expected Output

Deliver a reusable IEC 61131-3 ST function block with:
	â€¢	Inputs:
	â€¢	Execute (BOOL): Triggers the diagnostic read
	â€¢	SlaveAddress (BYTE): Identifies the target slave
	â€¢	Timeout (TIME): Defines maximum wait time
	â€¢	Outputs:
	â€¢	Done (BOOL): TRUE when diagnostics are successfully retrieved
	â€¢	Busy (BOOL): TRUE while waiting for response
	â€¢	Error (BOOL): TRUE if the operation fails
	â€¢	ErrorID (DWORD): Error code for diagnostics
	â€¢	Optional: DeviceStatus, CommHealth, or structured diagnostic data

Include internal logic to detect a rising edge on Execute, track operation state, parse the diagnostic data, and handle communication faults gracefully.

**Key Steps:**

1. Define the function block structure and inputs/outputs as described in the F (Format) section.
2. Initialize local variables for tracking operation state, error handling, and diagnostic data.
3. Implement a state machine to manage the function block's operation, including:
	â€¢	Idle: Wait for Execute input to transition to Ready
	â€¢	Ready: Initiate diagnostic request and set Busy to TRUE
	â€¢	Reading: Wait for diagnostic data response
	â€¢	Parsing: Parse the received data and set Done to TRUE
	â€¢	Error: Handle communication errors and set Error to TRUE
4. Implement a timer to track the elapsed time during the Ready and Reading states.
5. Implement a communication function to send diagnostic requests and receive responses using the Profibus DP protocol.
6. Implement error handling mechanisms to detect and recover from communication faults, such as timeouts, invalid responses, or unexpected errors.
7. Implement data parsing logic to extract diagnostic information from the received response, such as device status, error codes, and communication health.
8. Implement output logic to update the function block's outputs based on the current state and parsed diagnostic data.
9. Test the function block in a simulated or real-world environment to ensure proper operation and robustness.
10. Document the function block, including its purpose, inputs/outputs, and any assumptions or limitations.

**Example Code:**

```st
PROGRAM ProfibusDP_Diagnostics;

VAR
	Execute, Busy, Error, Done, TimeoutReached : BOOL;
	ErrorID : DWORD;
	DiagnosticData : BYTE[10];
	State : BYTE;
	Timer : TON;
	Counter : DWORD;
	SlaveAddress : BYTE;
	Timeout : TIME;

FUNCTION_BLOCK ProfibusDP_Diagnostic_Read
	(*Input*) Execute, SlaveAddress, Timeout;
	(*Output*) Done, Busy, Error, ErrorID;
	(*Internal*) DiagnosticData, State, Timer, Counter;

	(*Initialization*)
	State := 0;
	Busy := FALSE;
	Error := FALSE;
	Done :=
