**Notes:**

* This example is a simplified implementation of a 2-state discrete-time Kalman filter. In practice, you may want to consider more complex filter structures, such as extended or unscented Kalman filters, depending on the specific requirements of your application.
* The provided example assumes that the process noise covariance (Q) and measurement noise covariance (R) are scalars. In some cases, you may need to use diagonal matrices to represent these values if your application requires separate noise terms for position and velocity.
* The example does not include any error checking or handling for invalid input values. In a real-world implementation, you should add appropriate checks to ensure that the input values are within acceptable ranges.
* The example does not include any safety mechanisms to prevent the filter from diverging or becoming un
