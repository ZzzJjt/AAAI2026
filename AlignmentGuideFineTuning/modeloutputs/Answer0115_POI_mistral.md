### Intent:
**Intent Summary:**  
Develop an IEC 61131-3 Structured Text PID control program to maintain a chemical reactor pressure at 5.0 bar by dynamically adjusting a control valve, with safety limits, anti-windup, and fault handling for process stability and safety.

### Prompt:
**PID Flow Control Water Treatment:**

Develop a self-contained IEC 61131-3 Structured Text program to implement PID feedback control for chemical dosing in a water treatment process. The program should regulate the dosing rate of chlorine at 3 ppm, adjusting based on real-time flow measurements with a sampling rate of 100 ms.

The control logic should include PID parameters (proportional, integral, and derivative gains) that are tuned for maintaining the desired dosing concentration. Ensure the program accounts for any deviations from the setpoint and adjusts the chemical dosing accordingly, while including safety limits to prevent overdosing or underdosing. Discuss the importance of precise flow control in water treatment, with a focus on maintaining safe and effective chemical levels.

**B-A-B:**

ðŸŸ¥ B (Before) â€“ The Challenge

In water treatment processes, maintaining the correct chlorine dosing level is critical to ensure safe disinfection without risking overdosing or chemical waste. Traditional manual or open-loop systems lack the responsiveness to adapt to real-time fluctuations in water flow, leading to poor dosing precision, regulatory noncompliance, or safety risks.

// Calculate error
Error := Dosing_SP - Dosing_PV;

// PID logic
Integral := Integral + Error * 0.1; // 100 ms sample time
Derivative := (Error - Prev_Error) / 0.1;

Dosing_Output := (Kp * Error) + (Ki * Integral) + (Kd * Derivative);

// Clamp dosing output to safe range

    Dosing_Output := Min_Dose;
END_IF

This program uses PID control to adjust the chlorine dosing rate based on the error between the setpoint and the measured chlorine level. The PID parameters are tuned to achieve the desired response, and safety limits are implemented to prevent overdosing or underdosing. The program runs at a 100 ms sampling rate, ensuring accurate and responsive control in real-time.
