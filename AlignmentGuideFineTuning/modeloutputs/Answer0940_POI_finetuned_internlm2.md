### Intent:
The intent is to convert a Structured Text (ST) program for a Pick and Place automation system into an equivalent Instruction List (IL) representation while preserving all logic, timing, and mode-switching functionality for PLC execution.

### Prompt:
**Translate ST To Instruction List:**

Translate the following 61131-3 Structured Text program to 61131-3 Instruction List: PROGRAM PickAndPlace VAR ManualButton : BOOL; // Input signal for manual mode AutoButton : BOOL; // Input signal for auto mode ClipButton : BOOL; // Input signal for clip action TransferButton : BOOL; // Input signal for transfer action ReleaseButton : BOOL; // Input signal for release action ConveyorA : BOOL; // Input signal for presence of product on conveyor A ConveyorB : BOOL; // Output signal to control conveyor B RoboticArm : BOOL; // Output signal to control the robotic arm Mode : INT := 0; // Internal variable to store the current mode (0 = manual, 1 = auto) AutoProcess : BOOL := FALSE; // Internal variable to store whether the auto control process is currently running END_VAR

// Manual mode control process IF ManualButton THEN Mode := 0; // Set mode to manual END_IF

IF Mode = 0 THEN // Manual mode IF ClipButton AND ConveyorA THEN RoboticArm := TRUE; // Clip the product ELSIF TransferButton THEN ConveyorB := TRUE; // Transfer the product to conveyor B ELSIF ReleaseButton THEN ConveyorB := FALSE; // Release the product from conveyor B END_IF END_IF

// Auto mode control process IF AutoButton THEN Mode := 1; // Set mode to auto END_IF

IF Mode = 1 THEN // Auto mode IF NOT AutoProcess AND ConveyorA THEN // Only start the process if not currently running and there is a product on conveyor A AutoProcess := TRUE; // Set flag to indicate that the auto process is running RoboticArm := TRUE; // Clip the product WAIT 2; // Wait for 2 seconds to transfer the product ConveyorB := TRUE; // Transfer the product to conveyor B END_IF IF ConveyorB AND NOT ConveyorA THEN // Release the product from conveyor B once it has been transferred and there is no product on conveyor A ConveyorB := FALSE; AutoProcess := FALSE; // Clear the flag to indicate that the auto process is not running END_IF END_IF

**T-A-G:**

ðŸŸ¥ T (Task)

Translate a Structured Text (ST) program written in IEC 61131-3 into its equivalent Instruction List (IL) representation.

ðŸŸ© A (Action)

Take the provided PickAndPlace ST program, which includes variable declarations, mode selection, conditional logic for manual and automatic control, and a process delay (WAIT). Convert the logic into Instruction List using IL syntax such as LD, ST, AND, JMPC, JMP, and labels. Accurately simulate timing behavior and preserve all logical conditions, ensuring operational equivalence between the two formats.

ðŸŸ¦ G (Goal)

Deliver a complete and syntactically correct IL version of the program that maintains the same functional behavior as the original ST codeâ€”ready to be used on IL-compatible PLCs for industrial automation tasks.

**PICK AND PLACE SYSTEM:**

Translate the following 61131-3 Structured Text (ST) program into 61131-3 Instruction List (IL) for a pick and place system. The system has two conveyor belts, A and B, and a robotic arm. The system operates in manual and auto modes. In manual mode, the robotic arm clips a product from conveyor A and transfers it to conveyor B. In auto mode, the system waits for a product on conveyor A, clips it, waits for 2 seconds, transfers it to conveyor B, and releases it. The system also has input signals for manual and auto mode, as well as for clipping, transferring, and releasing products. The system has output signals for the robotic arm and conveyor B.
