ðŸŸ§ S (Steps) â€“ What You Need to Do
	1.	Create a function block named MeanStdDevCalculator with appropriate inputs and outputs:
 VAR_INPUT

  END_VAR
  VAR_OUTPUT

  END_VAR
  2.	Implement logic for the mean:
	â€¢	Accumulate the sum using a loop with a REAL accumulator to avoid overflow
	â€¢	Divide by 100.0 to obtain the mean
	3.	Implement logic for the standard deviation:
	â€¢	Loop again through the array
	â€¢	Subtract the mean from each element, square the result, and accumulate
	â€¢	Divide by 99.0 (N - 1) and apply the square root function to get the standard deviation
	4.	Use inline comments to explain each part of the process:
	â€¢	Why REAL is used for intermediate variables
	â€¢	Why the divisor is 99.0 (for sample standard deviation)
	â€¢	Error checking strategies (optional)
	5.	Optimize for real-time use:
	â€¢	Use fixed-size loops for deterministic timing
	â€¢	Avoid dynamic memory or recursive calls

**Function Block: MeanStdDevCalculator**

```structuredtext
FUNCTION_BLOCK MeanStdDevCalculator
VAR_INPUT
    InputArray : ARRAY[1..100] OF INT;
END_VAR
VAR_OUTPUT
    Mean : REAL;
    StdDev : REAL;
END_VAR

VAR
    Sum : REAL := 0.0;
    SumOfSquares : REAL := 0.0;
    MeanValue : REAL;
    StdDevValue : REAL;
    i : INT;
END_VAR

(* Calculate the mean *)
FOR i := 1 TO 100 DO
    Sum := Sum + REAL(InputArray[i]);
END_FOR;
MeanValue := Sum / 100.0;

(* Calculate the sample standard deviation *)
FOR i := 1 TO 100 DO
    SumOfSquares := SumOfSquares + (REAL(InputArray[i]) - MeanValue) * (REAL(InputArray[i]) - MeanValue);
END_FOR;
StdDevValue := SQRT(SumOfSquares / 99.0);

(* Assign outputs *)
Mean := MeanValue;
StdDev := StdDevValue;
END_FUNCTION_BLOCK
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Function Block Definition:**
   - The function block `MeanStdDevCalculator` takes an input array of 100 integers and outputs the mean and sample standard deviation.

2. **Variables:**
   - `Sum` and `SumOfSquares` are REAL variables to handle potential overflow and precision issues.
   - `MeanValue` and `StdDevValue` store the intermediate results.
   - `i` is an INT variable used as a loop counter.

3. **Calculating the Mean:**
   - A loop iterates through the input array, accumulating the sum of the elements as REAL values.
   - The mean is calculated by dividing the sum by 100.0.

4. **Calculating the Sample Standard Deviation:**
   - Another loop iterates through the array, calculating the sum of squared differences from the mean.
   - The sample standard deviation is computed by dividing the sum of squares by 99.0 (N - 1) and taking the square root.

5. **Output Assignment:**
   - The calculated mean and standard deviation are assigned to the output variables.

**Real-Time Considerations:**

- **Loop Optimization:** The loops are fixed-size, ensuring deterministic execution time.
- **Data Types:** Using REAL for intermediate calculations helps
