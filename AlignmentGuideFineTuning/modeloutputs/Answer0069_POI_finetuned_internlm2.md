ðŸŸ§ B (Bridge) â€“ The Implementation Strategy

To build this function block:
	1.	Declare the interface:
 FUNCTION_BLOCK SineFunction
VAR_INPUT
    AngleRad : REAL;
END_VAR
VAR_OUTPUT
    SineValue : REAL;
END_VAR
2.	Implement the core logic:
	â€¢	If the platform supports it:
 SineValue := SIN(AngleRad);
 	â€¢	If not, use a Taylor series (first 5â€“7 terms for reasonable precision):
  VAR
    x, x2, x3, x5, x7 : REAL;
END_VAR

x := AngleRad;
x2 := x * x;
x3 := x2 * x;
x5 := x3 * x2;
x7 := x5 * x2;
SineValue := x - (x3 / 6.0) + (x5 / 120.0) - (x7 / 5040.0);
3.	Add comments and notes:
	â€¢	Explain why radians are used
	â€¢	Discuss that sine values are periodic and bounded between -1 and 1
	â€¢	Warn that the approximation is best near zero, and large angles should be normalized
4.	Optional: Include a UseApproximation : BOOL input if both modes are supported

ðŸŸ¥ C (Context) â€“ The Surrounding Circumstances

In industrial automation, trigonometric functions like sine are often required for tasks such as motion control, robotics, and waveform generation. However, not all PLC environments using IEC 61131-3 Structured Text provide direct access to high-precision trigonometric libraries. Even when built-in functions are available, their real-time performance, resolution, and precision may vary depending on the hardware and runtime.

To address this challenge, a self-contained function block was developed in IEC 61131-3 Structured Text to compute the sine of a given angle in radians. The function block, named SineFunction, accepts one input (AngleRad) and outputs the sine value (SineValue). The core logic implements the sine calculation using either the built-in SIN() function (if available) or a Taylor series approximation for environments without SIN(). The function block is modular, reusable, and clearly commented, with a discussion on precision considerations, performance implications, and accuracy limitations due to floating-point precision.

The SineFunction block provides a self-contained solution for computing the sine of an angle in radians, with support for both built-in and approximation methods. The function block is modular, reusable, and well-documented, ensuring clear understanding of the underlying mathematical operations and their implications for real-time performance and accuracy.
