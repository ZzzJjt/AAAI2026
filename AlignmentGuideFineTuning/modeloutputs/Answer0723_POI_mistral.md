### Intent:
**Intent Summary:**  
Design a distillation column's safety interlock system by creating a textual P&I diagram and implementing IEC 61131-3 Structured Text logic to monitor and control critical parameters (pressure, temperature, level) with predefined thresholds, ensuring safe operation through automated protective actions.

### Prompt:
**Interlock Distillation Column:**

Develop a P&I diagram in textual notation for a distillation column, detailing the process equipment, instrumentation, control functions, safety interlocks, and piping. Use typical tagnames to represent elements such as the column (C-101), reboiler (E-101), condenser (E-102), level transmitters (LT-101), pressure transmitters (PT-101), and control valves (FV-101). Ensure the notation includes both the control functions and the safety interlocks, specifying their interactions with the piping and instrumentation system.

Following this, write a self-contained IEC 61131-3 Structured Text program to implement the interlocks of the distillation column. Include high and low limits for critical parameters such as pressure, temperature, and liquid level. For instance, trigger the pressure relief valve if the column pressure exceeds 120 psi (high limit) or shut off the feed valve if the pressure drops below 50 psi (low limit). Similarly, close the reboiler heat supply if the temperature exceeds 180Â°C. Discuss the role of interlocks in maintaining safe operating conditions within the distillation process.

ðŸŸ¥ R (Role) â€“ Your Role

Act as a process control engineer responsible for designing safety interlocks and control logic for a distillation column using both P&I diagram notation and IEC 61131-3 Structured Text.

ðŸŸ© T (Task) â€“ What You Need to Do
	1.	Develop a textual P&I diagram for a distillation column system. Use typical tagnames such as:
	â€¢	C-101 (column)
	â€¢	E-101 (reboiler), E-102 (condenser)
	â€¢	PT-101, TT-101, LT-101 (pressure, temperature, and level transmitters)
	â€¢	FV-101 (feed valve), PRV-101 (pressure relief valve)
The diagram should show how sensors and actuators are connected via control loops and safety interlocks.
	2.	Write a self-contained Structured Text program that implements interlock logic for key conditions, including:
	â€¢	Trigger PRV-101 if PT-101 > 120 psi
	â€¢	Shut FV-101 if PT-101 < 50 psi
	â€¢	Close reboiler heating valve if TT-101 > 180Â°C
	3.	Provide a short explanation of how these interlocks prevent hazardous conditions and maintain safe operation.

ðŸŸ§ F (Format) â€“ Expected Output

Deliverables should include:
	â€¢	A textual P&I diagram listing equipment, instruments, and interlock logic paths
	â€¢	A Structured Text code block implementing the described safety interlocks
	â€¢	A concise written description explaining how each interlock improves safety by responding to abnormal temperature, pressure, or level conditions
	â€¢	Optional: clear variable naming, comments, and modular code for ease of reuse and readability
