ðŸŸ© A (Action) â€“ How to Do It
	1.	Create a function block named NaturalLog with:
	â€¢	Input:
	â€¢	X : REAL â€” the number to compute ln(X)
	â€¢	Outputs:
	â€¢	LnX : REAL â€” the result of ln(X)
	â€¢	Error : BOOL â€” set to TRUE if X â‰¤ 0, indicating an invalid input
	2.	Implement the logic:
	â€¢	Use the built-in LN() function for valid inputs:

 IF X > 0.0 THEN
    LnX := LN(X);
    Error := FALSE;
ELSE
    LnX := 0.0;
    Error := TRUE;
END_IF;

	â€¢	Add inline comments explaining:
	â€¢	ln(X) is undefined for X â‰¤ 0
	â€¢	Why Error is raised for domain violations
	â€¢	How the function is kept simple and deterministic for PLC use

	3.	Ensure compatibility and efficiency:
	â€¢	Avoid recursion or dynamic structures
	â€¢	Ensure all code executes predictably within a scan cycle
	â€¢	Optionally include versioning or diagnostic codes for system integration

ðŸŸ¥ C (Context) â€“ The Situation

In industrial control systems, the natural logarithm is a fundamental mathematical operation used to model exponential growth, decay, and other processes. However, implementing logarithmic functions in PLC code can be challenging due to the limited precision and execution constraints of real-time systems. A self-contained function block is needed to ensure safe and efficient computation of the natural logarithm, while also providing clear documentation and error handling for industrial applications.

ðŸŸ© A (Action) â€“ The Actions Taken

To address the context, the following actions were taken:

â€¢	Developed a self-contained function block in IEC 61131-3 Structured Text to compute the natural logarithm of a given real input value.
â€¢	Ensured the function block is reusable, safe, and suitable for use in real-time industrial control systems.
â€¢	Implemented the logic to compute the natural logarithm, handling invalid inputs and providing clear error feedback.
â€¢	Added inline comments to explain the mathematical foundation of the natural logarithm and address potential edge cases.
â€¢	Ensured the function block is compatible with PLC execution constraints, avoiding recursion and dynamic structures.

ðŸŸ¨ R (Results) â€“ What Happened

The self-contained function block in IEC 61131-3 Structured Text provides a safe and efficient way to compute the natural logarithm of a given real input value. The implementation handles invalid inputs by raising an error flag and returns a default value of 0.0 for non-positive inputs. The inline comments explain the mathematical foundation of the natural logarithm and address potential edge cases, ensuring clear documentation for industrial applications.

ðŸŸ© E (Evidence) â€“ Proof of the Action Taken

The self-contained function block in IEC 61131-3 Structured Text is provided below, with inline comments explaining the logic and addressing potential edge cases:

			LnX := LN(X);
			Error := FALSE;
		ELSE
			LnX := 0.0;
			Error := TRUE;
