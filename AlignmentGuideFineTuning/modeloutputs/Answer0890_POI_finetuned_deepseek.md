### Intent:
**Intent Summary:**  
Develop a structured text program to control a conveyor system with manual/automatic modes, sensor-based object detection, and emergency stop functionality, ensuring safe operation through prioritized stop conditions and mode-specific logic.

### Prompt:
**Traffic Light Control System Using 61131-3 Structured Text:**

Write a self-contained 61131-3 structured text program (not a function block) to control a traffic light system. The system should respond to pedestrian push buttons, allowing safe crossing by adjusting traffic light timings accordingly. Additionally, the system must detect the presence of emergency vehicles and prioritize their passage by adjusting the light sequence to provide a clear path. Implement logic to ensure smooth traffic flow while giving priority to safety and emergency response.

**T-A-G:**

ðŸŸ¥ T (Task) â€“ What You Need to Do

Develop a self-contained Structured Text (ST) program following IEC 61131-3 standards to control a traffic light system. The system must support normal signal sequencing, pedestrian safety requests, and emergency vehicle priority handling.

ðŸŸ© A (Action) â€“ How to Do It
	1.	Implement Standard Signal Sequencing:
	â€¢	Use a TrafficState variable to manage transitions:
	â€¢	0 = Red, 1 = Green, 2 = Yellow
	â€¢	Use a TON timer to control how long each state lasts:
	â€¢	Red = 10s, Green = 10s, Yellow = 3s
	2.	Handle Pedestrian Requests:
	â€¢	When a PedestrianRequest is detected during the red phase, extend the red time and delay transition to green.
	â€¢	After the request is fulfilled, resume the normal light cycle.
	3.	Respond to Emergency Vehicle Detection:
	â€¢	When EmergencyDetected = TRUE, force the system to switch to green immediately and pause all other transitions.
	â€¢	Once the emergency clears, return to the normal sequence safely.
	4.	Control State Transitions Safely:
	â€¢	Avoid abrupt switches or overlaps by resetting timers properly and handling edge cases with boolean flags.

â¸»

ðŸŸ¦ G (Goal) â€“ What You Want to Achieve

You aim to deliver a safe, responsive, and efficient traffic control program that:
	â€¢	Allows pedestrians to cross safely with button-triggered requests
	â€¢	Grants priority to emergency vehicles with immediate green light overrides
	â€¢	Cycles traffic lights smoothly under normal operation
	â€¢	Can be expanded with vehicle sensors, audible pedestrian signals, or SCADA integration
