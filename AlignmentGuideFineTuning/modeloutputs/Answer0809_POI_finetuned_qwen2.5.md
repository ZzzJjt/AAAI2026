### Intent:
Implement a C++-based Model Predictive Control (MPC) system to optimize wind farm power generation by dynamically adjusting turbine operations under fluctuating wind conditions while maintaining grid stability and respecting operational constraints.  

*(Key focus: real-time adaptive control, efficiency optimization, and constraint handling for renewable energy systems.)*

### Prompt:
**Model Predictive Control for Wind Farm Optimization Using C++:**

Develop C++ code to implement a model predictive control (MPC) algorithm to optimize the operation of a wind farm. The control system should consider factors such as wind speed variability, turbine dynamics, and power output efficiency. It should also ensure grid stability while accounting for constraints on turbine operation, energy storage, and power dispatch under fluctuating environmental conditions.

Implement C++ code to simulate the wind farmâ€™s operational dynamics and demonstrate the effectiveness of the MPC in managing real-time power generation and distribution.
