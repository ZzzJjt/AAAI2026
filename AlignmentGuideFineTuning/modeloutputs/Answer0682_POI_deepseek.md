*(Focused on reactor control parameters, automation readiness, and safety compliance.)*

### Prompt:
**Control Narrative for Ammonium Nitrate Reactor**

Create a control narrative for a reactor producing ammonium nitrates including concrete setpoints and ranges.

**R-I-S-E:**

ðŸŸ¥ R (Role) â€“ Define Your Role

You are a process control engineer responsible for developing a clear, automation-ready control narrative for an ammonium nitrate reactor used in industrial chemical production.

â¸»

ðŸŸ© I (Input) â€“ Information Provided

The reactor operates by reacting ammonia and nitric acid in a controlled environment. Your control narrative must include:
	â€¢	Concrete setpoints and operational ranges for temperature, pressure, flow, and pH
	â€¢	A list of critical instrumentation and equipment (e.g., TICs, PICs, flow controllers, analyzers)
	â€¢	Normal startup, operation, and shutdown procedures
	â€¢	Safety interlocks and alarm triggers for deviations from normal conditions

â¸»

ðŸŸ§ S (Steps) â€“ Steps to Perform
	1.	Define the core control parameters:
	â€¢	Temperature: 175â€¯Â°C (range: 173â€“177â€¯Â°C)
	â€¢	Pressure: 4.8â€¯bar (range: 4.6â€“5.0â€¯bar)
	â€¢	Flow ratio: Ammonia:Acid = 1.01:1
	â€¢	pH: 6.2 (acceptable range: 5.8â€“6.5)
	2.	List required instrumentation:
	â€¢	TIC-101 (reactor temperature controller)
	â€¢	PIC-102 (reactor pressure controller)
	â€¢	FIC-103/FIC-104 (ammonia/nitric acid flow controllers)
	â€¢	AIC-105 (pH analyzer)
	â€¢	LSH-106 (high-level switch for overfill protection)
	3.	Describe operating procedures:
	â€¢	Startup: Valve checks, initialize jacket heating, ramp up flows
	â€¢	Normal Operation: Maintain setpoints with PID loops; monitor pH and adjust feed as needed
	â€¢	Shutdown: Stop feeds, vent pressure, cool reactor, close all valves
	4.	Define interlocks and alarms:
	â€¢	ESD if Temp > 185â€¯Â°C, Pressure > 5.2â€¯bar, or pH < 5.5
	â€¢	Trigger alarms and lockout if ammonia or acid feed deviates Â±10% from target ratio

â¸»

ðŸŸ¦ E (Expectation) â€“ Expected Outcome

Deliver a clear, structured, and technically sound control narrative that:
	â€¢	Can be used by automation teams to configure DCS/PLC systems
	â€¢	Supports safety, efficiency, and compliance in reactor operation
	â€¢	Provides the basis for interlock diagrams, HMI logic, and alarm design
	â€¢	Enhances operator understanding and engineering documentation
