### Intent:
**Intent Summary:**  
Create a structured text function block to automatically retrieve and process diagnostic data from a Profibus DP slave device, including status, error codes, and communication health, with error handling and output mapping for PLC monitoring.

### Prompt:
**Profibus DP Diagnostics Using 61131-3 Structured Text:**

Develop a self-contained 61131-3 structured text function block to read diagnostic data from a Profibus DP slave device. The function block should handle communication with the Profibus DP slave and retrieve diagnostic information such as device status, error codes, and communication health. Provide an explanation of the key steps in processing the diagnostic data, including request initiation, data retrieval, and error handling mechanisms.

**B-A-B:**

ðŸŸ¥ B (Before) â€“ The Challenge

In many industrial environments, maintaining reliable Profibus DP communication is critical. However, accessing diagnostic data from Profibus DP slave devices is often manual or vendor-specific, making it difficult to monitor device health, detect errors early, or respond to communication failures in real time from within standard PLC logic.

â¸»

ðŸŸ© A (After) â€“ The Ideal Outcome

Develop a self-contained IEC 61131-3 Structured Text (ST) function block that enables PLC programs to automatically retrieve diagnostic information from a Profibus DP slave. This function block should communicate with the slave device to gather data such as device status, error codes, and communication health, and expose the information for monitoring or control logic.

â¸»

ðŸŸ§ B (Bridge) â€“ The Implementation Strategy

Design the function block to initiate a diagnostic request to a Profibus DP slave cyclically or on demand. Use input parameters to trigger the request and select the slave address. Internally, implement logic to:
	â€¢	Start the request based on a rising edge of an Execute signal
	â€¢	Communicate with the Profibus interface to retrieve the diagnostic buffer
	â€¢	Parse key elements such as module status, communication errors, and device fault codes
	â€¢	Map this information to structured outputs for controller-level monitoring

Include error detection (e.g., timeout, invalid response) and provide output flags such as Done, Error, and ErrorID to allow the main program to handle failures appropriately.

The function block should be designed to be easily configurable, with parameters for slave address, request type, and output mapping.

**Example Implementation:**

```st
FUNCTION_BLOCK ProfibusDiagnostics
  VAR_INPUT
    Execute: BOOL;
    SlaveAddress: INT;
  END_VAR_INPUT

  VAR
    DiagnosticBuffer: ARRAY[0..255] OF BYTE;
    Status: BOOL;
    Error: BOOL;
    ErrorID: INT;
  END_VAR

  VAR_INPUT
    Execute: BOOL;
    SlaveAddress: INT;
  END_VAR_INPUT

  VAR
    DiagnosticBuffer: ARRAY[0..255] OF BYTE;
    Status: BOOL;
    Error: BOOL;
    ErrorID: INT;
  END_VAR

  FUNCTION
    IF Execute THEN
      Status := FALSE;
      Error := FALSE;
      ErrorID := 0;

      IF ProfibusMaster.ReadSlave(SlaveAddress, DiagnosticBuffer) THEN
        Status := TRUE;
        Error := FALSE;
        ErrorID := 0;
      ELSE
        Status := FALSE;
        Error := TRUE;
        ErrorID := 1;  // Timeout or other communication error
      END_IF;
    END_IF;

    DiagnosticData := DiagnosticBuffer;
  END_FUNCTION
END_FUNCTION_BLOCK
```

**Key Steps in Processing Diagnostic Data:**

1. **Initiate the Diagnostic Request:** The function block should have an input parameter to trigger the request, such as a Boolean flag called "Execute." When this flag is set to TRUE, the function block initiates the diagnostic request to the Profibus DP slave.

2. **Communicate with the Profibus DP Slave:** The function block should use the Profibus Master interface to communicate with the slave device. This can be done using a function like "ReadSlave" or "WriteSlave" depending on the specific Profibus Master library used.

3. **Parse Diagnostic Data:** Once the diagnostic buffer is retrieved, the function block should parse the data to extract relevant information. This may involve examining specific bytes or fields within the buffer to identify device status, error codes, and communication health.

4. **Map Diagnostic Data to Outputs:** The parsed diagnostic data should be mapped to structured outputs for monitoring or control logic. This can be done using standard IEC 61131-3 data types and structures, such as BOOL, INT, or ARRAY.

5. **Handle Errors:** The function block should include error detection
