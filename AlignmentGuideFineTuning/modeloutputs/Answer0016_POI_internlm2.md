**Model Predictive Control for HVAC System Optimization Using C++:**

Develop C++ code to implement a model predictive control (MPC) algorithm for optimizing the performance of a Heating, Ventilation, and Air Conditioning (HVAC) system. The control system should manage temperature, humidity, and energy consumption while maintaining occupant comfort. It must consider dynamic constraints such as varying external temperatures, occupancy levels, and energy efficiency requirements, ensuring optimal control under changing environmental conditions.

Implement C++ code to simulate the HVAC systemâ€™s dynamics, and demonstrate how MPC can optimize energy usage, response time, and system performance while adhering to operational constraints.

  // Predict future environmental conditions
  std::vector<double> predictedConditions = predictEnvironmentalConditions(conditions);

  // Optimize control decisions based on predicted models and real-time constraints
  std::vector<double> controlDecisions = optimizeControlDecisions(currentSystem, predictedConditions, params);

  // Apply control decisions to the HVAC system
  applyControlDecisions(controlDecisions);

  // Return updated HVAC system state
  return getUpdatedSystemState();
}
