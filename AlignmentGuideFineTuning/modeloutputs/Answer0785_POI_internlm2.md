**Explanation:**

The provided function block implements the heapsort algorithm in IEC 61131-3 Structured Text. It takes an array of integers and a boolean input to trigger the sorting process. The function block outputs the sorted array and a flag indicating whether the sorting is complete.

The function block first checks the input array size and data type to ensure they are valid for the heapsort algorithm. It then constructs a max heap by iterating over the array from the middle to the beginning, calling the `Heapify` function to maintain the heap property. After the heap is constructed, the function block sorts the array by swapping the root element with the last element, reducing the heap size, and calling `Heapify` again to restore the heap property. This process is repeated until the entire array is sorted.

The `Heapify` function is an iterative implementation of the heapify operation, which maintains the heap property by swapping elements if necessary. It takes the array, the current index, and the heap size as inputs and performs the necessary swaps and comparisons to ensure the heap property is maintained.

The function block also includes input validation to ensure the array size is within the allowed range (1 to 32767)
