### Intent:
**Intent Summary:**  
Develop an IEC 61131-3 Structured Text function block to compute the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) for real-time signal analysis on PLCs, optimizing for industrial constraints (fixed input sizes, deterministic execution) with detailed algorithmic comments and diagnostic considerations.  

**Key Focus:**  
Efficient radix-2 FFT implementation, real-time suitability, and practical use cases (e.g., vibration analysis).

### Prompt:
**Fast Fourier Transform:**

Develop a self-contained function block in IEC 61131-3 Structured Text to compute the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) of a given input array. Ensure that the implementation is efficient and includes detailed comments explaining the algorithmic steps involved in computing the FFT. Discuss any limitations in terms of computational complexity and real-time performance, as well as considerations for handling input size constraints typically found in industrial control systems.

	â€¢	Includes detailed comments explaining each step in the algorithm (e.g., bit-reversal, butterfly computation, twiddle factor application)
	â€¢	Ensures the implementation is optimized for:
	â€¢	Memory and processing constraints of industrial PLCs
	â€¢	Deterministic execution time suitable for real-time control loops
