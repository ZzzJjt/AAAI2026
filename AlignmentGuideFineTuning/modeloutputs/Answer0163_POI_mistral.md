### Intent:
**Intent Summary:**  
Create a structured text function block to convert a 10-digit decimal value to hexadecimal in IEC 61131-3, handling large values and edge cases for industrial automation applications.

### Prompt:
**DecToHex:**
Implement a self-contained function block in IEC 61131-3 structured text to convert a 10-digit decimal value to hexadecimal. Ensure proper handling of large values and edge cases.

**B-A-B:**

ðŸŸ¥ B (Before) â€“ The Problem or Challenge

In industrial automation systems, thereâ€™s often a need to display or log numerical data in hexadecimal format, especially for diagnostics, memory addresses, or communication protocols. However, standard data type limitations and lack of built-in conversion tools in some PLCs make it challenging to safely convert large decimal values (up to 10 digits) into hex. Failing to handle edge casesâ€”such as overflows or unsupported value rangesâ€”can lead to runtime errors or incorrect results.

â¸»

ðŸŸ© A (After) â€“ The Desired Outcome

Develop a self-contained function block in IEC 61131-3 Structured Text that converts a 10-digit decimal value to its hexadecimal representation. The function block should:
	â€¢	Accept a large decimal input (e.g., up to 9999999999)
	â€¢	Perform accurate conversion to a hex string
	â€¢	Handle edge cases, such as values at or beyond the upper limit of the platformâ€™s numeric range
	â€¢	Return the result as a STRING or ARRAY of characters for easy integration with HMI, logging, or communication logic

â¸»

ðŸŸ§ B (Bridge) â€“ How to Get There
	1.	Define the function block interface with inputs like:
	â€¢	DecValue : DINT or LINT (depending on platform)
	2.	Use internal logic to:
	â€¢	Loop through the value using modulo and division by 16
	â€¢	Convert numeric remainders (0â€“15) into corresponding ASCII hex characters ('0'..'F')
	â€¢	Build the hex string in reverse, then output it correctly
	3.	Output:
	â€¢	HexString : STRING or equivalent
	4.	Add input validation and comments to explain logic and platform-specific constraints.

**Code Example:**

```
FUNCTION_BLOCK DecToHex
  VAR_INPUT
    DecValue : LINT;
  END_VAR

  VAR
    HexChars : ARRAY[0..9] OF CHAR;
    i : INT;
  END_VAR

  IF DecValue < 0 THEN
    DecValue := DecValue * -1;
  END_IF;

  FOR i := 9 DOWTO 0 DO
    HexChars[i] := '0' + (DecValue MOD 16);
    DecValue := DecValue DIV 16;
  END_FOR;

  HexString := '';
  FOR i := 0 TO 9 DO
    HexString := HexString + HexChars[i];
  END_FOR;

  HexString := REVERSE(HexString);

  HexString OUT;
END_FUNCTION_BLOCK
```

**Notes:**

1.	This example assumes a 32-bit LINT data type for the input value. Adjust the data type according to your PLCâ€™s capabilities.
2.	The function block returns the hexadecimal string in reverse order. Reverse the string before using it in your application if needed.
3.	The function block handles negative values by converting them to positive before performing the conversion.
4.	You may want to add additional input validation to ensure the input value is within the supported range.
