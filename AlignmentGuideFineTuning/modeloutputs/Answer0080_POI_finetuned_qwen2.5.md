### Intent:
**Intent Summary:**  
Develop a PLC function block in Structured Text for cubic spline interpolation that efficiently computes smooth curves between data points while addressing memory and real-time constraints in industrial automation applications.

### Prompt:
**Spline Interpolation:**

Develop a self-contained function block in IEC 61131-3 Structured Text to compute spline interpolation over a set of data points. Ensure that the function block is modular and efficient, with comments explaining the steps involved in constructing and evaluating the spline. Address potential computational challenges, such as memory usage and processing time, and discuss the advantages of spline interpolation in comparison to linear methods, particularly in applications where smooth curve fitting is essential.

**B-A-B:**

🟥 B (Before) – The Challenge

In industrial automation and process control, interpolating between data points is a common requirement — whether for sensor calibration, lookup tables, or motion path generation. While linear interpolation is simple, it often leads to sharp transitions or discontinuities that are not suitable for applications requiring smooth curve fitting. Unfortunately, implementing spline interpolation on PLCs using IEC 61131-3 Structured Text can be complex due to limited memory, no native spline libraries, and real-time execution constraints.

🟩 A (After) – The Ideal Outcome

Develop a modular, efficient, and self-contained function block in IEC 61131-3 Structured Text, named SplineInterpolator, that:
	•	Accepts a set of known data points:
	•	X[] : ARRAY[...] OF REAL — known x-coordinates
	•	Y[] : ARRAY[...] OF REAL — known y-values (function values at each x)
	•	Accepts a target value:
	•	TargetX : REAL — the x value at which to interpolate
	•	Returns:
	•	InterpolatedY : REAL — the interpolated y value based on spline logic
	•	Implements cubic spline interpolation:
	•	Precompute spline coefficients (a, b, c, d) during initialization or configuration phase
	•	Evaluate the spline segment during runtime using the appropriate interval
	•	Includes inline comments explaining:
	•	The spline construction process
	•	How the coefficients are calculated
	•	How to efficiently evaluate the polynomial at runtime
	•	Handles computational trade-offs:
	•	Minimizes memory by precomputing only for a limited number of segments
	•	Optimizes runtime performance by avoiding repeated coefficient calculations

⸻

🟧 B (Bridge) – The Implementation Strategy

To implement the SplineInterpolator function block:
	1.	Precompute coefficients (offline or during configuration):
	•	Solve a tridiagonal system to obtain c (second derivatives)
	•	Back-solve for b and d
	•	Store coefficients per interval
	2.	At runtime, identify the segment where TargetX lies:
	•	Use a FOR loop or binary search to find the index i such that X[i] ≤ TargetX < X[i+1]
	3.	Evaluate the spline:
y = a_i + b_i (x - x_i) + c_i (x - x_i)^2 + d_i (x - x_i)^3
	4.	Discuss the benefits:
	•	Spline interpolation avoids discontinuities in derivatives
	•	Better suited for applications needing smooth transitions, such as:
	•	Robot trajectory control
	•	Analog signal reconstruction
	•	Temperature profile modeling
	5.	Document challenges:
	•	Memory usage increases with number of data points
	•	Scan time may increase for large datasets unless coefficients are preprocessed
	•	May not be practical for ultra-low-latency applications without optimization
