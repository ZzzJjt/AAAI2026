ðŸŸ© I (Input) â€“ Information Provided

You are to build a function block that:
	â€¢	Accepts a temperature value in Fahrenheit
	â€¢	Converts it to Celsius using the standard formula
	â€¢	Includes input validation to reject values below absolute zero (âˆ’459.67Â°F)
	â€¢	Returns the Celsius temperature and a boolean flag indicating input validity
	â€¢	Ensures safety and accuracy during execution in scan-cycle-sensitive PLC environments

ðŸŸ§ S (Steps) â€“ Steps to Perform
	1.	Define the function block interface with:
	â€¢	Fahrenheit : REAL (Input)
	â€¢	Celsius : REAL (Output)
	â€¢	ValidInput : BOOL (Output)
	2.	Implement input validation:
	â€¢	If Fahrenheit >= -459.67, proceed with conversion
	â€¢	Else, set Celsius := 0.0 and ValidInput := FALSE
	3.	Perform the conversion using the formula:
Celsius := (Fahrenheit - 32) \times \frac{5}{9}
	4.	Include inline comments explaining the calculation and safety check
	5.	Test the block with edge values to confirm robustness

ðŸŸ¦ E (Expectation) â€“ Expected Outcome

Produce a scan-cycle-safe, modular function block that performs accurate and validated Fahrenheit-to-Celsius conversion. The result should be suitable for use in control logic, HMI displays, or logging, and should improve both code reliability and reusability across PLC applications.

**B-A-B-E:**

ðŸŸ¥ B (Before) â€“ The Challenge

In industrial automation, temperature values often need to be processed in both Fahrenheit and Celsius. However, many PLC platforms lack built-in conversion utilities, and direct calculations can lead to errors or safety risks, especially when handling edge cases like sub-zero Fahrenheit values.

ðŸŸ© A (After) â€“ The Ideal Outcome

Develop a self-contained function block in IEC 61131-3 Structured Text that:
	â€¢	Accepts Fahrenheit input
	â€¢	Converts it to Celsius using the formula
	â€¢	Includes input validation to reject values below absolute zero
	â€¢	Returns both the Celsius temperature and a boolean flag indicating the validity of the input
	â€¢	Ensures scan-cycle-safe execution and accurate results

ðŸŸ§ B (Bridge) â€“ The Implementation

	â€¢	Define the function block with inputs and outputs:
	â€¢	Input: Fahrenheit : REAL
	â€¢	Output: Celsius : REAL, ValidInput : BOOL
	â€¢	Implement input validation:
	â€¢	IF Fahrenheit >= -459.67 THEN
	â€¢	ELSE
	â€¢	â€¢	Celsius := 0.0
	â€¢	â€¢	ValidInput := FALSE
	â€¢	â€¢	END_IF
	â€¢	Perform the conversion:
	â€¢	Celsius := (Fahrenheit - 32) \times \frac{5}{9}
	â€¢	Add comments explaining the steps and safety checks
	â€¢	Include a scan-cycle-safe execution strategy

ðŸŸ¦ E (Example) â€“ A Real-World Application

Use the function block in a temperature control system where:
	â€¢	Inputs from sensors are in Fahrenheit
	â€¢	The system requires Celsius values for PID control or safety limits
	â€¢	Ensure that the function block is scan-cycle-safe and handles edge cases properly
	â€¢	Integrate the function block into the control logic to maintain system stability and safety
