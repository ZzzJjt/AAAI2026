# Chemical Reactor Fuzzy Control in Python

This code implements a fuzzy logic controller in Python to optimize the operation of a chemical reactor. The controller adjusts the reactor's temperature, pressure, and reaction rate by dynamically adjusting heater power, pressure valve settings, and reactant flow rates. The fuzzy logic system uses linguistic terms to represent the process variables and control actions, and employs a rule-based approach to make decisions.

## Fuzzy Logic Controller Design

The fuzzy logic controller is designed with the following components:

1. **Fuzzification**: Maps the process variables (temperature, pressure, and reaction rate) to fuzzy sets using linguistic terms such as "cold," "hot," "low," "medium," and "high."

2. **Fuzzy Inference System (FIS)**: Uses a rule-based approach to make decisions based on the fuzzified process variables. The rules are defined using IF-THEN logic, where conditions (e.g., "temperature is high") are matched with actions (e.g., "increase heater power").

3. **Defuzzification**: Converts the fuzzy output (control actions) into a crisp value that can be used to adjust the reactor's control parameters.

## System Overview

The chemical reactor operates under nonlinear and time-varying conditions, making it difficult to control using traditional methods such as PID. The fuzzy logic controller provides a more adaptive and robust solution by handling uncertainty and disturbances. The system architecture is shown below:

## Implementation

### Step 1: Define Fuzzy Sets

Define membership functions for temperature, pressure, and reaction rate using Python's `triu` function:

```python
import numpy as np

# Membership functions
def triu(x, a=1.0, b=5.0):
    return np.piecewise(x, [x < a, x >= a], [0, (x - a) / (b - a)])

# Fuzzy sets for temperature
temperature_cold =
