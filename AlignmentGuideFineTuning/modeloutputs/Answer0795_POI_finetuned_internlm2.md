### Intent:
**Intent Summary:**  
Create a 30-line I/O list table for a steel rolling mill's automation system, detailing signal names, types (analog/digital), engineering units, ranges, setpoints, and P&ID references to support PLC/HMI configuration and process control documentation.  

*(Focus: Structured I/O documentation for rolling mill instrumentation and control signals.)*

### Prompt:
**IO List Rolling Mill:**

Create an I/O list as a table with 30 lines for a rolling mill in a steel production plant. Have as columns signal name, input/output, signal tagnumber, analog/digital, engineering unit, ranges, setpoint, and P&ID reference.

**R-T-F:**

ðŸŸ¥ R (Role) â€“ Define Your Role

Act as a control systems engineer responsible for creating detailed I/O documentation for the automation of a rolling mill in a steel production facility.

â¸»

ðŸŸ© T (Task) â€“ Define the Objective

Generate a structured I/O list table containing 30 lines, each representing a control or monitoring signal relevant to the rolling mill process. Each row must include the following columns:
	â€¢	Signal Name
	â€¢	Input/Output
	â€¢	Signal Tagnumber
	â€¢	Analog/Digital
	â€¢	Engineering Unit
	â€¢	Range
	â€¢	Setpoint
	â€¢	P&ID Reference

The list should reflect realistic instrumentation, such as motor speed feedback, roll gap position, cooling valve control, hydraulic pressure, and strip tension.

ðŸŸ§ F (Format) â€“ Specify the Output Format

Provide the output as a cleanly formatted table suitable for documentation, HMI/PLC configuration, or Excel import. The format should support:
	â€¢	Clear signal identification and traceability
	â€¢	Inclusion of engineering metadata (units, range, setpoints)
	â€¢	Cross-reference with P&ID diagrams for system integration
	â€¢	Compatibility with control logic implementation and commissioning workflows

ðŸŸ¥ R (Role) â€“ Define Your Role

As a control systems engineer, you are responsible for creating detailed I/O documentation for the automation of a rolling mill in a steel production facility. Your task is to generate a structured I/O list table containing 30 lines, each representing a control or monitoring signal relevant to the rolling mill process. Each row must include the following columns: Signal Name, Input/Output, Signal Tagnumber, Analog/Digital, Engineering Unit, Range, Setpoint, and P&ID Reference.

â¸»

ðŸŸ© I (Input) â€“ Provide Relevant Background

In a steel production facility, a rolling mill is a critical piece of equipment responsible for shaping and sizing hot-rolled steel strips. The rolling mill requires precise control of various process parameters, such as roll gap, strip tension, and cooling water flow, to ensure consistent product quality and efficient operation.

â¸»

ðŸŸª S (Strategy) â€“ Determine Your Approach

To create the I/O list, you will need to consider the specific instrumentation and control requirements of a rolling mill. Focus on key process parameters, such as roll gap position, strip tension, and cooling water flow, and ensure that each signal is clearly identified with its associated tag number, input/output type, engineering unit, and range. Include setpoints where applicable to indicate the desired operating conditions for each parameter. Finally, reference the relevant P&ID diagram to ensure that the I/O list aligns with the overall system architecture.

ðŸŸ¥ O (Output) â€“ Deliver Your Answer

Create a 30-line I/O list table for a rolling mill in a steel production facility, with each row containing the following information:

	â€¢	Signal Name
	â€¢	Input/Output
	â€¢	Signal Tagnumber
	â€¢	Analog/Digital
	â€¢	Engineering Unit
	â€¢	Range
	â€¢	Setpoint
	â€¢	P&ID Reference

Ensure that the table is well-organized and self-contained, with clear column headings and consistent formatting. Focus on realistic instrumentation and control signals relevant to the rolling mill process, such as roll gap position, strip tension
