### Intent:
**Intent Summary:**  
Develop an IEC 61131-3 Structured Text function block to monitor OPC UA, Modbus, and Profinet connections, trigger alarms on failures, and log protocol-specific errors with timestamps for real-time diagnostics.

### Prompt:
**Communication Monitoring for OPC UA, Modbus, and Profinet Using IEC 61131-3 Structured Text:**

Develop a function block in structured text (ST) as per IEC 61131-3 standards to monitor communication connections to an OPC UA server, Modbus server, and Profinet in a machine system. The function block should continuously check the connection status of each protocol, and if any connection fails, an alarm should be triggered. Additionally, when a connection is lost, an entry must be created in the audit trail, detailing the reason for the server being down along with the corresponding error code. Discuss the implementation logic for monitoring multiple protocols, error detection, and how to effectively manage and log communication failures for real-time monitoring and troubleshooting.

ðŸŸ¥ R (Role) â€“ Your Role

Act as a PLC programmer using IEC 61131-3 Structured Text to develop diagnostic and monitoring tools for industrial communication systems.

ðŸŸ© T (Task) â€“ Your Objective

Develop a Structured Text (ST) function block that monitors the communication status of OPC UA, Modbus, and Profinet protocols in a machine system. The block must continuously check each connection, trigger an alarm when a failure is detected, and log an entry in the audit trail with details such as the protocol, error reason, and error code. The function block should support independent handling of each protocol and be robust enough for real-time industrial use.

ðŸŸ§ F (Format) â€“ Expected Output

Provide an IEC 61131-3 compliant ST function block that includes:
	â€¢	Input variables for connection state and error information
	â€¢	Internal logic to detect communication failures and recoveries
	â€¢	Boolean alarms or error flags for each protocol
	â€¢	Structured audit logging (e.g., protocol name, error code, reason, timestamp)
	â€¢	Comments explaining logic for maintenance and reuse

ðŸŸ¥ C (Context) â€“ Background Situation

In industrial automation, maintaining reliable communication with external systems is critical. OPC UA, Modbus, and Profinet are widely used protocols, but without proper monitoring, communication failures can lead to downtime, safety risks, or missed production targets. A dedicated function block in IEC 61131-3 Structured Text can provide real-time diagnostics and logging, ensuring that engineers and operators are immediately aware of any communication issues.

ðŸŸ© A (Action) â€“ Task Implementation

Develop a self-contained function block in IEC 61131-3 Structured Text that:
	â€¢	Accepts inputs for connection status and error codes from each protocol
	â€¢	Includes logic to monitor the connection status of OPC UA, Modbus, and Profinet
	â€¢	Triggers an alarm if any connection fails
	â€¢	Automatically logs an entry in the audit trail with details such as the reason for server being down, error code, and timestamp
	â€¢	Ensures that each protocolâ€™s communication status is monitored and managed independently
	â€¢	Includes comments explaining the logic for clarity and maintainability

ðŸŸ§ R (Result) â€“ Expected Outcome

The function block will:
	â€¢	Enable real-time monitoring of communication connections to OPC UA, Modbus, and Profinet
	â€¢	Provide immediate alarms for connection failures, allowing for quick troubleshooting
	â€¢	Automatically log communication failures with detailed audit trail entries, including reason, error code, and timestamp
	â€¢	Be structured and documented for easy integration into industrial control systems and PLC programs
	â€¢	Help in maintaining high communication reliability and system stability in industrial environments

In summary, the function block will serve as a diagnostic and logging utility for industrial communication systems, ensuring that engineers and operators are well-informed about the health of their network connections and can respond quickly to any issues that arise.
