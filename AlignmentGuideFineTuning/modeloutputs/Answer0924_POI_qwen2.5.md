**UreaReactionControl Program Documentation**

**Overview:**
The UreaReactionControl program is designed to automate the urea synthesis process in a two-step procedure. It manages valve operations, monitors pressure and temperature, and ensures the reaction proceeds within specified parameters.

**Variables:**

**Inputs:**
- `stAmmoniaValve`: A boolean indicating whether the ammonia valve is open.
- `stCO2Valve`: A boolean indicating whether the COâ‚‚ valve is open.
- `rCurrentPressure`: A real number representing the current pressure in the reactor.
- `rCurrentTemperature`: A real number representing the current temperature in the reactor.

**Outputs:**
- `stAmmoniaValveControl`: A boolean used to control the opening of the ammonia valve.
- `stCO2ValveControl`: A boolean used to control the opening of the COâ‚‚ valve.

**Internals:**
- `stStep1`: A boolean flag indicating whether the first step (loading raw materials) is complete.
- `stStep2`: A boolean flag indicating whether the second step (controlling the reaction) is complete.
- `stReactionFinished`: A boolean flag indicating whether the reaction is finished.
- `rTargetPressure`: A real number representing the target pressure in the reactor.
- `rPressureTolerance`: A real number representing the acceptable pressure tolerance.
- `rTargetTemperature`: A real number representing the target temperature in the reactor.
- `rTemperatureTolerance`: A real number representing the acceptable temperature tolerance.
- `tReactionTime`: A time duration representing the total reaction time.
- `tReactionTimer`: A time variable used to track the reaction duration.

**Parameters:**
- `rTargetPressure`: The target pressure in the reactor.
- `rPressureTolerance`: The acceptable pressure tolerance.
- `rTargetTemperature`: The target temperature in the reactor.
- `rTemperatureTolerance`: The acceptable temperature tolerance.
- `tReactionTime`: The total reaction time.

**Logic Flow:**

1. **Step 1: Load Raw Materials**
   - If `stStep1` is false, open the ammonia and COâ‚‚ valves.
   - Check if both valves are open. If so, set `stStep1` to true and record the current time as `tReactionTimer`.

2. **Step 2: Control Reaction**
   - If `stStep2` is false, monitor the current pressure and temperature.
   - If both are
