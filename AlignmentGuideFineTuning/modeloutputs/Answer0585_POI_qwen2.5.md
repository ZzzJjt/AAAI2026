**IEC 61499: A Concise Introduction for IEC 61131-3 Professionals**

IEC 61499 is a programming language designed for distributed control systems, particularly suited for Industry 4.0 applications. It extends the capabilities of IEC 61131-3 by introducing event-driven function blocks, enabling more efficient and flexible control strategies.

**Key Concepts:**

1. **Function Blocks**: IEC 61499 introduces three types of function blocks:
	* Basic function blocks: Simple, reusable components.
	* Composite function blocks: Assemble multiple basic blocks into complex functionalities.
	* Service interface function blocks: Provide communication and coordination between blocks.
2. **Event-Data Separation**: Unlike IEC 61131-3's scan-based execution, IEC 61499 separates event generation from data processing, allowing for more efficient and responsive control.
3. **Event-Driven Execution Model**: Function blocks execute only when triggered by an event, reducing unnecessary computations and improving system performance.
4. **Distribution Across Networked Devices**: IEC 61499 supports distributed control, enabling function blocks to be executed on different devices within a network, optimizing resource utilization and scalability.

**Comparison with IEC 61131-3:**

1. **Architecture**: IEC 61131-3 is centralized, while IEC 61499 is distributed, allowing for more flexible and scalable control architectures.
2. **Execution Models**: IEC 61131-3 uses a scan-based execution model, whereas IEC 61499 employs an event-driven approach, resulting in more efficient and responsive control.
3. **Flexibility for Distributed Control**: IEC 61499's event-driven execution model and distribution capabilities make it ideal for modern industrial control systems, where flexibility and scalability are essential.
