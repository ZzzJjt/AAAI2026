### Intent:
**Intent Summary:**  
Develop a C++ MPC algorithm to optimize HVAC system performance by balancing temperature, humidity, and energy efficiency under dynamic constraints like weather and occupancy, with simulation outputs demonstrating control effectiveness.  

*(For turbine example: "Implement a Python MPC controller for a turbine system to regulate temperature and power output under varying load and ambient conditions, with simulation and performance metrics.")*

### Prompt:
**Model Predictive Control for HVAC System Optimization Using C++:**

Develop C++ code to implement a model predictive control (MPC) algorithm for optimizing the performance of a Heating, Ventilation, and Air Conditioning (HVAC) system. The control system should manage temperature, humidity, and energy consumption while maintaining occupant comfort. It must consider dynamic constraints such as varying external temperatures, occupancy levels, and energy efficiency requirements, ensuring optimal control under changing environmental conditions.

Implement C++ code to simulate the HVAC systemâ€™s dynamics, and demonstrate how MPC can optimize energy usage, response time, and system performance while adhering to operational constraints.
