### Intent:
**Intent Summary:**  
Create a NORSOK-compliant textual System Control Diagram (SCD) for an LNG vaporizer system, detailing process flow, instrumentation (e.g., FT201/FIC201/FCV201), control loops (e.g., TT101/TIC101/TCV101), safety interlocks (e.g., PSH301â†’ESD1), and tagged components to ensure compliance with standards and support control system design.  

**Code Generation Intent:**  
Generate structured textual notation for an LNG vaporizer SCD with process flow, control loops, and safety logic using standardized tags and NORSOK conventions.

### Prompt:
**SCD LNG Vaporizer:**

Create a NORSOK system control diagram (SCD) in textual notation for a LNG Vaporizer System. Include instrumentation, control loops, and interlocks. Provide concrete tag numbers and piping.


**T-A-G:**

ðŸŸ¥ T (Task)

Develop a NORSOK-compliant System Control Diagram (SCD) in textual notation for an LNG vaporizer system.

â¸»

ðŸŸ© A (Action)
	â€¢	Outline the full process flow from LNG inlet to gas outlet using arrows (-->) to indicate direction.
	â€¢	Include all relevant instrumentation and control loops, such as:
	â€¢	Flow control loop: FT201 â†’ FIC201 â†’ FCV201
	â€¢	Temperature control loop: TT101 â†’ TIC101 â†’ TCV101
	â€¢	Add interlocks for critical conditions like overpressure and overtemperature, e.g.:
	â€¢	PSH301 â†’ ESD1 (Shut Heater Steam)
	â€¢	TSH302 â†’ ESD2 (Block LNG Inlet)
	â€¢	Assign realistic tag numbers to all instruments and final control elements.
	â€¢	Organize the text into clear sections for process flow, control loops, and safety logic.

â¸»

ðŸŸ¦ G (Goal)

Produce a structured and readable textual SCD that reflects the control philosophy, instrumentation layout, and safety systems of the LNG vaporizer processâ€”serving as a reference for control system design, HAZOP studies, and compliance with NORSOK I-005 standards.

**SCD LNG Vaporizer:**

Create a NORSOK-compliant System Control Diagram (SCD) in textual notation for an LNG Vaporizer System. Include instrumentation, control loops, and interlocks.

	â€¢	Process Flow:
	â€¢	LNG from vessel â†’ Vaporizer â†’ Gas â†’ Turbine
	â€¢	Control loops:
	â€¢	FT201 â†’ FIC201 â†’ FCV201 (Flow control)
	â€¢	TT101 â†’ TIC101 â†’ TCV101 (Temperature control)
	â€¢	Interlocks:
	â€¢	ESD1: PSH301 â†’ ESD1 (Overpressure interlock)
	â€¢	ESD2: TSH302 â†’ ESD2 (Overtemperature interlock)
	â€¢	Assign concrete tag numbers to all instruments and control elements.

	â€¢	Following NORSOK standards, create a text-based SCD that includes:
	â€¢	Process flow arrows (-->) to indicate direction
	â€¢	Control loops with instrumentation tags (e.g., FT201, FIC201, FCV201)
	â€¢	Interlocks with safety actions (e.g., ESD1, ESD2)
	â€¢	Concrete tag numbers for all elements
	â€¢	Organize the text into logical sections for clarity
	â€¢	Ensure the SCD is structured and easy to read, with a focus on control philosophy and safety logic.

	â€¢	For example:
	â€¢	"FT201 â†’ FIC201 â†’ FCV201: LNG flow control loop."
	â€¢	"TT101 â†’ TIC101 â†’ TCV101: Vaporizer temperature control loop."
	â€¢	"ESD1: Overpressure interlock (PSH301 â†’ ESD1)."
	â€¢	"ESD2: Overtemperature interlock (TSH302 â†’ ESD2)."
	â€¢	Include concrete tag numbers for each control and safety device.

	â€¢	Compile the textual SCD into a structured format, ensuring it is compliant with NORSOK standards and includes all relevant control and safety logic.

	â€¢	For further development, create a function block diagram (FBD) in IEC 61131-3 to support the control logic implementation, ensuring that the FBD is based on the textual SCD and includes all control loops and safety inter
