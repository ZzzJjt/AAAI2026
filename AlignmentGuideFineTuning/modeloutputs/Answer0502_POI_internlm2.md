	â€¢	Output: either amplitude array or real/imaginary arrays
	2.	Implement FFT logic using:
	â€¢	Bit-reversal reordering
	â€¢	Butterfly computation with twiddle factors
	â€¢	Looping constructs that avoid recursion or dynamic memory usage
	3.	Optimize for PLC performance by:
	â€¢	Using only power-of-two input sizes
	â€¢	Precomputing or approximating sine/cosine values if needed
	â€¢	Limiting execution time to fit within typical scan cycles
	4.	Comment thoroughly, explaining:
	â€¢	Purpose of each calculation step
	â€¢	How twiddle factors are computed and applied
	â€¢	How to interpret the resulting frequency bins
	5.	Document known limitations, such as:
	â€¢	Fixed input length
	â€¢	Absence of floating-point complex number support on some PLCs

ðŸŸ¦ E (Expectation) â€“ What Success Looks Like

You deliver a modular, efficient FFT function block that performs spectral analysis in real time, suitable for:
	â€¢	Vibration monitoring
	â€¢	Motor current signature analysis
	â€¢	Predictive maintenance triggers
	â€¢	Harmonic analysis in power systems

	â€¢	Vibration monitoring
	â€¢	Motor current signature analysis
	â€¢	Predictive maintenance triggers
	â€¢	Harmonic analysis in power systems

The block should run within acceptable PLC scan times, remain numerically stable, and provide meaningful frequency-domain data without external processing tools. The comments and documentation should be clear and concise, allowing other engineers to understand and modify the code as needed.

**Additional Considerations:**

1.	**Memory Constraints:** PLCs have limited memory, so ensure that the function block uses minimal memory and does not require dynamic memory allocation.
2.	**Scan Time Constraints:** PLCs have a fixed scan time, typically in the order of milliseconds. Ensure that the FFT computation completes within this time frame.
3.	**Fixed Input Size:** PLCs often have fixed input sizes, such as 64 points. Ensure that the function block can handle such constraints and does not require resizing or dynamic memory allocation.
4.	**Numerical Stability:** Ensure that the FFT computation remains numerically stable, especially when dealing with large input arrays or high frequencies.
5.	**Complex Number Support:** Some PLCs may not support complex number operations directly. Consider alternative approaches to handle real/imaginary parts or use a library that provides complex number support.
6.	**Performance Optimization:** Optimize the FFT algorithm for real-time performance, considering factors such as loop unrolling, precomputing twiddle factors, and minimizing memory access.
7.	**Documentation:** Provide clear and concise documentation that explains the algorithmic steps, twiddle factor computation, and interpretation of the frequency bins. Include any known limitations and recommendations for handling them.
8.	**Testing:** Thoroughly test the function block with various input arrays, including edge cases and real-world scenarios, to ensure its correctness and performance.

**Deliverables:**

1.	**Function Block Code:** A self-contained IEC 61131-3 Structured Text function block that implements the FFT algorithm.
2.	**Documentation:** Detailed comments within the code and a separate document that explains the algorithmic steps, performance considerations, and known limitations.
3.	**Test Cases:** A set of test cases that verify the correctness and performance of the function block under various scenarios.

**Deadline:** 2 weeks from the start of the project.

**Budget:** $500 (USD)
