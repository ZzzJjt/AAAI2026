### Intent:
**Intent Summary:**  
Create a traffic light control system using IEC 61131-3 that manages normal operation, pedestrian requests, and emergency overrides via a finite state machine (FSM), ensuring safe transitions and prioritized responses to emergencies.

### Prompt:
**Learning IEC 61499:**
Provide a concise introduction to the IEC 61499 programming language, emphasizing key concepts for someone already familiar with IEC 61131-3. Include a comparison of their fundamental differences in terms of architecture, execution models, and flexibility for distributed control systems. Additionally, compile a list of five key references for further reading on IEC 61499, highlighting its relevance in modern industrial applications.

**T-A-G:**

üü• T (Task) ‚Äì What You Need to Do

Introduce IEC 61499 to an audience that already understands IEC 61131-3. The focus should be on making the transition approachable by clearly explaining what‚Äôs new, what‚Äôs different, and why it matters for modern industrial systems.

‚∏ª

üü© A (Action) ‚Äì How You Should Approach It
	1.	Summarize the key concepts of IEC 61499:
	‚Ä¢	Event-driven architecture
	‚Ä¢	Function blocks with separated event/data interfaces
	‚Ä¢	Distribution across networked devices
	2.	Compare with IEC 61131-3 by highlighting differences in:
	‚Ä¢	Execution models (event-driven vs. scan-based)
	‚Ä¢	Architecture (distributed vs. centralized)
	‚Ä¢	Reusability and portability (61499‚Äôs platform independence)
	3.	Compile a list of 5 recommended resources for further learning:
	‚Ä¢	Standards documents, key textbooks, and application papers
	‚Ä¢	Focus on modern use cases in distributed control and Industry 4.0

‚∏ª

üü¶ G (Goal) ‚Äì What You Should Deliver

A clear, practical guide that helps control engineers:
	‚Ä¢	Quickly grasp how IEC 61499 differs from IEC 61131-3
	‚Ä¢	Understand where and why to use IEC 61499 in modern systems
	‚Ä¢	Begin their learning journey with trusted reference materials
