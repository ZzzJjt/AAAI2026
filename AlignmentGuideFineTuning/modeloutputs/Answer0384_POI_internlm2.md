### Intent:
**Intent Summary:**  
Create an ASCII-based Function Block Diagram (FBD) showing signal flow between an analog input, timer, PID controller, and analog output, with labeled I/O signals for PLC control logic documentation.  

*(Focus: Textual representation of a PID control loop in IEC 61131-3 FBD format.)*

### Prompt:
**FBD PID:**

Create a 61131-3 function block diagram in ASCII art. It shall contain an analog input, a timer block, and a PID block as well as an analog output. The analog input feeds both the timer and the PID block. Only the PID block is connected to the analog output. Provide typical input and output signals for each function block and show them inside each block.

**C-A-R-E:**

ðŸŸ¥ C (Context) â€“ Background Situation

When designing control systems using IEC 61131-3 Function Block Diagrams (FBD), itâ€™s often helpful to communicate the layout using ASCII art in documentation, code comments, or plain text environments where graphical tools arenâ€™t available. A basic structure involving an analog input, timer, PID controller, and analog output is a common pattern in automation and control logic design.

ðŸŸ© A (Action) â€“ Task to Perform

Create an ASCII-based FBD diagram that includes:
	â€¢	An analog input block
	â€¢	A TON (on-delay) timer block
	â€¢	A PID control block
	â€¢	An analog output block

The analog input should feed both the timer and the PID controller, and only the PID block should be connected to the analog output. Inside each block, show the typical signal names for the inputs and outputs (e.g., IN, ET, PV, SP, CV, OUT, etc.).

â¸»

ðŸŸ¨ R (Result) â€“ Expected Outcome

You will produce a text-based representation of a function block diagram that clearly illustrates the signal flow, block interconnections, and naming conventions used in PLC programming. This will help engineers document control strategies, review logic, and share designs without the need for graphics software.

In this example, the analog input (AI) is connected to both the timer (TON) and the PID controller (PID). The timer has an enable input (ET) and a delay time (Q) that determines when the output (Q) is activated. The PID controller has a setpoint (SP) and a process variable (PV) that are compared to produce a control variable (CV). The analog output (AO) receives the control variable (CV) as its input (IN).

ðŸŸ§ E (Extension) â€“ Additional Considerations

- **Signal Naming:** Use standard IEC 61131-3 signal names for inputs and outputs, such as IN, OUT, PV, SP, CV, etc. This will make it easier for other engineers to understand the function block diagram.
- **Signal Flow:** Ensure that the signal flow is clear and unambiguous. The analog input should feed both the timer and the PID controller, and the PID controller should be connected to the analog output.
- **Block Interconnections:** Use clear and concise lines to represent the connections between the blocks. Avoid crossing lines or using complex shapes that might confuse readers.
- **Block Labels:** Include labels for each function block to make it easy to identify the purpose of each block.
- **Signal Labels:** Include labels for the input and output signals within each function block. This will help readers understand the purpose of each signal and how it relates to the overall control logic.
