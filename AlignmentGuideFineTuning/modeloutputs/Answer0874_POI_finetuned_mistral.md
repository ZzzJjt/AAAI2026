### Intent:
**Intent Summary:**  
Create a Structured Text function block implementing the Simplex algorithm for linear programming in PLCs to enable on-device optimization of industrial processes (e.g., resource allocation, batch blending) with constraints on memory, execution time, and numerical precision.

### Prompt:
**Linear Programming:**

Develop a self-contained function block in IEC 61131-3 Structured Text to solve a linear programming problem using the simplex method. Ensure the function block is designed to handle multiple constraints and objective functions, with detailed comments explaining the algorithm and each computational step. Discuss the limitations of implementing linear programming in a PLC environment, particularly with respect to memory and processing power, and provide examples of how this function block could be applied in industrial optimization scenarios.

ðŸŸ© A (Action) â€“ How to Do It
	1.	Create a function block named SimplexSolver with the following inputs:
	â€¢	C: Objective function coefficients (ARRAY[1..N] OF REAL)
	â€¢	A: Constraint matrix (ARRAY[1..M, 1..N] OF REAL)
	â€¢	B: Right-hand side values (ARRAY[1..M] OF REAL)
	2.	Implement the Simplex algorithm, including:
	â€¢	Initialization of the simplex tableau
	â€¢	Pivot column and row selection logic
	â€¢	Row operations and tableau updates
	â€¢	Termination criteria for optimality or maximum iterations
	3.	Output the results:
	â€¢	Optimal solution vector X: ARRAY[1..N] OF REAL
	â€¢	Optimized objective value
	â€¢	Status flag (e.g., success, infeasible, timeout)
	4.	Add clear inline comments for each algorithm step to explain:
	â€¢	Mathematical logic
	â€¢	Handling of infeasible solutions and potential rounding issues
	â€¢	Performance and memory considerations for real-time PLC execution
	5.	Discuss limitations and design choices, such as:
	â€¢	Fixed matrix sizes for memory safety
	â€¢	Execution time constraints on PLCs
	â€¢	Floating-point accuracy concerns
