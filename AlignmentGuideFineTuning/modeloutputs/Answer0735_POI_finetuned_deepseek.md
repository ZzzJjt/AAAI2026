ðŸŸ© T (Task) â€“ What You Need to Do

Create a self-contained function block named MatrixMultiply4x4 that:
	â€¢	Performs multiplication of two 4Ã—4 matrices
	â€¢	Accepts two inputs:
	â€¢	MatrixA: ARRAY[1..4, 1..4] OF REAL
	â€¢	MatrixB: ARRAY[1..4, 1..4] OF REAL
	â€¢	Returns:
	â€¢	MatrixC: ARRAY[1..4, 1..4] OF REAL, the resulting matrix product
	â€¢	Implements standard matrix multiplication logic using triple nested FOR loops
	â€¢	Includes detailed inline comments explaining each step of the multiplication process, including:
	â€¢	Iteration over rows and columns
	â€¢	Inner loop to compute dot products
	â€¢	Resetting the output element before summing products
	â€¢	Follows IEC 61131-3 structured text conventions for clarity, reusability, and compatibility
	â€¢	Discusses limitations:
	â€¢	Computational complexity: O(nÂ³), not scalable for large matrices on PLCs
	â€¢	Real-time constraints: impact of loop depth on scan cycle time
	â€¢	Memory usage: array-based implementation must be fixed and pre-sized
