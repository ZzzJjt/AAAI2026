### Intent:
**Intent Summary:**  
Develop a Python-based model predictive control (MPC) system to optimize continuous cellulose fiber production by managing a hybrid batch-continuous process with time delays and fluctuating demand, ensuring high buffer tank levels to prevent downstream disruptions.  

*(Focus: MPC for delay compensation, demand adaptation, and tank-level stabilization in a mixed batch/continuous process.)*

### Prompt:
**Model Predictive Control for Continuous Cellulose Fiber Production Using Python:**

Explain how model predictive control (MPC) can optimize cellulose fiber production from wood, where continuous infeed and outfeed operations are required, while the material undergoes a two-stage batch process. The material is supplied at an average rate of 50 tons per hour, undergoing pre-treatment in a reactor followed by homogenization before entering a 1,000 cubic meter buffer tank. The product is extracted from the tank on demand, not at a constant rate. To minimize downtime in downstream processes, a high fill level in the tank must be maintained, despite the two-hour delay caused by upstream batch processes, making PID control unsuitable.

Develop Python code to simulate the system dynamics, including the dead time and fluctuating demand.

Implement Python code for a model predictive control (MPC) algorithm to optimize material flow, taking into account the time delay, fluctuating demand, and operational constraints.

**R-I-S-E:**

ðŸŸ¥ Rï¼ˆRoleï¼‰

Act as a process control engineer developing advanced control strategies for continuous industrial production systems using Python.

ðŸŸ© Iï¼ˆInputï¼‰

You are working with a cellulose fiber production process in which raw material is fed continuously at 50 tons/hour into a two-stage batch system (reactor and homogenizer), followed by storage in a 1,000 mÂ³ buffer tank. The upstream introduces a two-hour delay, and product outflow from the tank is based on fluctuating demand. The control objective is to keep the tank level high to avoid downstream shutdowns. Traditional PID control is inadequate due to the delay and demand variability.

ðŸŸ§ Sï¼ˆStepsï¼‰
	1.	Explain why model predictive control (MPC) is suitable for handling time delays and demand-driven outflow in continuous-batch hybrid systems.
	2.	Use Python to model the system dynamics, including the two-stage batch process, time delay, tank behavior, and stochastic demand.
	3.	Implement an MPC algorithm that predicts future system states and adjusts feed rates in advance to maintain optimal buffer levels.
	4.	Simulate different demand scenarios to validate MPC performance against constraints.

ðŸŸ¦ Eï¼ˆExpectationï¼‰

The result should be a robust control system that anticipates future demand, mitigates the effect of delays, and maintains high tank levelsâ€”ensuring uninterrupted downstream operations and improved process efficiency, which is not achievable using conventional PID strategies.
