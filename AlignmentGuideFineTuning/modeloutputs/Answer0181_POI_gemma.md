*(Focus: Documentation for PLC/DCS implementation with precise parameters and procedural clarity.)*

### Prompt:
**Control Narrative Beer Brewing:**

Create a control narrative for beer brewing including concrete setpoints and ranges.

Create a detailed explanation of the Lautering process (Section 4). Include the equipment and instrumentation needed. Provide a list of the steps to execute.

**B-A-B:**

ðŸŸ¥ B (Before) â€“ The Problem or Challenge

In brewery automation projects, engineers often lack standardized documentation for complex processes like beer brewing. Without a well-structured control narrative, itâ€™s difficult to define setpoints, control logic, and instrumentation for each phaseâ€”especially for stages like lautering, which involve precise timing, flow control, and mechanical coordination. Inconsistent or vague narratives can lead to inefficiencies or errors during automation design or commissioning.

**Section 1: Overview**

Brewing is a complex process that involves multiple stages, including mashing, lautering, boiling, and fermentation. Each stage has specific requirements for temperature, flow, and timing.

Brewing automation involves controlling these parameters to ensure consistent and efficient production.

**Section 2: Mashing**

Mashing is the process of converting starches in the grain into fermentable sugars. It involves heating the grain and water mixture to a specific temperature range (65â€“68â€¯Â°C) and holding it for a set period of time.

The mash tun is the vessel used for mashing. It is equipped with a temperature sensor to monitor the temperature of the mash.

The mashing process is controlled by a PLC or DCS, which receives input from the temperature sensor and adjusts the heating elements to maintain the desired temperature range.

**Section 3: Sparging**

Sparging is the process of rinsing the spent grain from the mash tun and transferring the wort (unfermented beer) to the lauter tun.

The sparge water is heated to a specific temperature range (75â€“78â€¯Â°C) and pumped into the mash tun. The flow rate is controlled by a flow transmitter, which sends a signal to the PLC or DCS to adjust the pump speed.

The sparge water is diverted to the waste tank if the turbidity (cloudiness) of the wort exceeds a certain threshold. This is determined by a turbidity sensor, which sends a signal to the PLC or DCS to open a valve and divert the flow.

**Section 4: Lautering**

Lautering is the process of separating the wort from the spent grain. It involves transferring the wort from the mash tun to the lauter tun, where it is filtered through a bed of grain.

The lauter tun is equipped with a rake system to stir the grain bed and a flowmeter to monitor the flow rate of the wort.

The lautering process is controlled by a PLC or DCS, which receives input from the flowmeter and adjusts the rake motor to maintain a specific flow rate (1.5â€“2.0 L/min).

The PLC or DCS also receives input from a turbidity sensor to determine when to stop the lautering process. If the turbidity of the wort exceeds a certain threshold, the PLC or DCS will stop the flow of wort and divert it
