### Intent:
**Intent Summary:**  
Create a reusable IEC 61131-3 function block in Structured Text (ST) that wraps a C-based OPC UA client, enabling PLCs to securely connect to OPC UA servers with configurable inputs (Execute, ServerUrl, Timeout) and robust status outputs (Done, Busy, Error, ErrorID) for industrial communication.  

*(Focus: Integration of OPC UA client functionality into PLC logic with error handling and state management.)*

### Prompt:
**OPC UA Client Implementation Using C and IEC 61131-3 Structured Text:**

Develop C-code for an OPC UA client, then wrap it into an IEC 61131-based function block written in structured text (ST). The function block should have the following input pins: Execute (type: BOOL), ServerUrl (type: STRING[255]), and Timeout (type: TIME). The output pins should include Done (type: BOOL), Busy (type: BOOL), Error (type: BOOL), and ErrorID (type: DWORD). In your explanation, describe how the C-code interfaces with the OPC UA server, how the function block manages communication with the server, and how error handling is implemented. Provide details on how to integrate this function block within an IEC 61131-3 environment for reliable client-server communication.

ðŸŸ¥ T (Task) â€“ What You Need to Do

Create a C-based OPC UA client and wrap it into an IEC 61131-3 Structured Text (ST) function block for use in a PLC environment.

â¸»

ðŸŸ© A (Action) â€“ How to Do It

Implement the OPC UA client in C using a standard library such as open62541. The client should establish connections, manage sessions, and handle error conditions. Then, expose this functionality through a Structured Text function block with the following interface:

Inputs:
	â€¢	Execute (BOOL): Triggers the connection
	â€¢	ServerUrl (STRING[255]): Specifies the OPC UA server
	â€¢	Timeout (TIME): Sets the connection timeout

Outputs:
	â€¢	Done (BOOL): Set when the operation completes successfully
	â€¢	Busy (BOOL): Indicates ongoing operation
	â€¢	Error (BOOL): Flags a failure
	â€¢	ErrorID (DWORD): Provides detailed error information

Ensure the function block handles rising-edge detection on Execute, maintains internal state for communication control, and maps C function return values to appropriate PLC outputs.

ðŸŸ¦ G (Goal) â€“ What You Want to Achieve

Provide a reusable, PLC-friendly function block that allows seamless and reliable OPC UA client communication from within an IEC 61131-3 environment. This enhances the systemâ€™s ability to exchange data with external OPC UA servers while offering robust status monitoring and error reporting for industrial-grade reliability.

**C-A-R-E:**

ðŸŸ¥ C (Context) â€“ Background Situation

In industrial automation, OPC UA (Open Platform Communications Unified Architecture) is widely used for secure, reliable communication between devices and systems. However, integrating OPC UA functionality directly into PLC logic using native C-code can be complex and error-prone. A standardized, function block-based approach is needed to ensure consistent, maintainable, and error-handling-aware communication with OPC UA servers.

â¸»

ðŸŸ© A (Action) â€“ Steps to Perform

	1.	Develop C-code for an OPC UA client using a well-documented library (e.g., open62541).
	2.	Implement key OPC UA operations such as connection initiation, data retrieval, and error handling.
	3.	Translate the C-code logic into structured text (ST) for use in IEC 61131-3 environments.
	4.	Create a function block with inputs for Execute, ServerUrl, and Timeout, and outputs for Done, Busy, Error, and ErrorID.
	5.	Implement logic to handle rising-edge detection on Execute, manage internal state, and map C function results to PLC outputs.
	6.	Perform thorough testing to ensure proper communication, error detection, and fault handling.

ðŸŸ¦ R (Result) â€“ Desired Outcome

The result is a self-contained function block that enables OPC UA client functionality within IEC 61131-3 environments. This block will:
	â€¢	Allow PLC programs to initiate and manage OPC UA connections securely.
	â€¢	Provide real-time status feedback on connection status, error conditions, and communication health.
	â€¢	Be reusable across multiple projects, improving code maintainability and reducing development time.

ðŸŸ© E (Example) â€“ How It Works in Practice

	â€¢	When Execute is set to TRUE, the function block will initiate a connection to the specified OPC UA server using the provided ServerUrl and Timeout settings.
	â€¢	Communication with the server will occur in a loop, with Done being set to TRUE when the connection is successfully established.
	â€¢	Busy will be TRUE while the connection is being established or when communication is ongoing.
	â€¢	Error will be TRUE if any communication errors occur, and ErrorID will provide a detailed error code for troubleshooting.
