ðŸŸ¨ V (Validation) â€“ Define the Validation Criteria

The PID controller function block should be validated against the following criteria:
	â€¢	Accuracy: The PID controller should accurately track the setpoint with minimal overshoot and settling time.
	â€¢	Stability: The PID controller should not exhibit unstable behavior, such as oscillations or divergence.
	â€¢	Anti-windup: The PID controller should prevent integral windup and handle it gracefully when it occurs.
	â€¢	Output clamping: The PID controller should not exceed the specified output limits.
	â€¢	Real-time execution: The PID controller should complete its calculations within one scan cycle.

ðŸŸ© E (Execution) â€“ Define the Execution Steps

1.	Define the function block structure and inputs/outputs.
2.	Initialize the internal states (error, integral term, derivative term) to zero.
3.	Calculate the control error by subtracting the process variable from the setpoint.
4.	Apply the proportional gain to the error to obtain the proportional term.
5.	Apply the integral gain to the error and integrate the result to obtain the integral term.
6.	Apply the derivative gain to the rate of change of the process variable to obtain the derivative term.
7.	Update the integral term with the clamped integral term if anti-windup is enabled.
8.	Apply output clamping to the sum of the proportional, integral, and derivative terms.
9.	Update the internal states for the next scan cycle.
10.	Return the control output.
