**Fuzzy Logic Control for Chemical Reactor Optimization Using Python:**

**Origin**

Develop Python code to implement a fuzzy logic control system for optimizing the operation of a chemical reactor. The control system should manage key reactor variables such as temperature, pressure, and reaction rate, considering the nonlinear and uncertain nature of the reactorâ€™s dynamics. Fuzzy logic should be applied to handle imprecise inputs and adjust control actions in real-time to maintain optimal reactor performance under varying operating conditions.
