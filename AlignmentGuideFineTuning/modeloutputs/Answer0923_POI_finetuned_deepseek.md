### Intent:
The task is to **correct and refactor a traffic light control program in IEC 61131-3 ST by replacing non-compliant constructs (e.g., `WHILE TRUE`) with a finite state machine, proper timer usage, and edge detection to ensure reliable, scan-friendly operation that prioritizes emergency vehicles and pedestrian safety**.  

*(Summary focuses on the core intent: fixing structural/logical errors while maintaining compliance and functional requirements.)*

### Prompt:
**Fix Traffic Light Code:**

Can you find the error in the following 61131-3 ST code: PROGRAM TrafficLightControl VAR pedestrianButtonPressed: BOOL; emergencyVehicleApproaching: BOOL; greenLightOn: BOOL; yellowLightOn: BOOL; redLightOn: BOOL; timer: TON; // timer to control the duration of green and yellow lights END_VAR

// Initialize the program greenLightOn := TRUE; yellowLightOn := FALSE; redLightOn := FALSE; timer(IN := NOT emergencyVehicleApproaching, PT := T#5s);

// Main program loop WHILE TRUE DO // Check for pedestrian button press pedestrianButtonPressed := ReadPedestrianButton();

// Check for emergency vehicle approaching
emergencyVehicleApproaching := ReadEmergencyVehicleSensor();

IF emergencyVehicleApproaching THEN
    // Turn off all lights and turn on green light for emergency vehicle
    greenLightOn := TRUE;
    yellowLightOn := FALSE;
    redLightOn := FALSE;
    timer(IN := FALSE);

ELSEIF pedestrianButtonPressed THEN
    // Turn off all lights and turn on red light and pedestrian light
    greenLightOn := FALSE;
    yellowLightOn := FALSE;
    redLightOn := TRUE;
    timer(IN := FALSE);

    // Wait for pedestrian to cross
    WAIT UNTIL NOT pedestrianButtonPressed;

    // Turn on yellow light for warning and start the timer
    yellowLightOn := TRUE;
    redLightOn := FALSE;
    timer(IN := NOT emergencyVehicleApproaching);

ELSE
    // Check the timer and switch to the next light if it's time
    IF timer.Q THEN
        IF greenLightOn THEN
            greenLightOn := FALSE;
            yellowLightOn := TRUE;
            timer(IN := NOT emergencyVehicleApproaching);

        ELSEIF yellowLightOn THEN
            yellowLightOn := FALSE;
            redLightOn := TRUE;
            timer(IN := FALSE);

        ELSE // red light is on
            redLightOn := FALSE;
            greenLightOn := TRUE;
            timer(IN := NOT emergencyVehicleApproaching);
        END_IF;
    END_IF;
END_IF;

// Set the traffic lights based on the variables
SetTrafficLights(greenLightOn, yellowLightOn, redLightOn);

// Wait for a short time before checking again
DELAY 100ms;

END_WHILE

// Read the emergency vehicle sensor state from an input FUNCTION ReadEmergencyVehicleSensor: BOOL // Code to read the input goes here END_FUNCTION

ðŸŸ¥ T (Task) â€“ What You Need to Do

Review and correct a 61131-3 Structured Text program that controls a traffic light system. The system must correctly handle three conditions:
	â€¢	Normal traffic operation
	â€¢	Pedestrian button activation
	â€¢	Emergency vehicle approach

The existing code contains structural and logical errors (e.g., use of WHILE TRUE and WAIT UNTIL) that prevent proper cyclic PLC execution and lead to unreliable behavior.

â¸»

ðŸŸ© A (Action) â€“ How You Should Approach It
	1.	Remove non-standard programming constructs:
	â€¢	Eliminate WHILE TRUE DO and WAIT UNTIL, which are not IEC 61131-3 compliant for cyclic scan models.
	2.	Implement a finite state machine (FSM) using a CASE statement:
	â€¢	Define clear states such as GREEN_PHASE, YELLOW_PHASE, RED_PHASE, PEDESTRIAN_WAIT, and EMERGENCY_OVERRIDE.
	â€¢	Control light transitions and timer logic based on these states.
	3.	Correct the use of the TON timer:
	â€¢	Initialize the timer only once per phase and control it using a persistent instance (timer(IN := TRUE)).
	4.	Use rising edge detection (e.g., R_TRIG):
	â€¢	For detecting new pedestrian requests or emergency vehicle presence without false triggers.
	5.	Update light outputs only once per cycle:
	â€¢	Use SetTrafficLights(...) at the end of each scan, based on the current state logic.

â¸»

ðŸŸ¦ G (Goal) â€“ What the Final Code Should Achieve
	â€¢	A scan-friendly and safe PLC program that:
	â€¢	Prioritizes emergency vehicle passage by switching directly to green
	â€¢	Enables pedestrians to cross safely by introducing a red phase
	â€¢	Follows a valid and maintainable light cycle sequence
	â€¢	Uses a reusable, extensible structure with timers and state variables
	â€¢	Complies fully with IEC 61131-3 for industrial applications
