**T-A-G:**

ðŸŸ¥ T (Task)

Develop a control narrative for an ethanol production process, with emphasis on the fermentation phase, including all critical parameters and automation logic.

â¸»

ðŸŸ© A (Action)
	â€¢	Specify concrete setpoints and ranges for key fermentation variables such as temperature (e.g., 32â€“35â€¯Â°C), pH (e.g., 4.5â€“5.0), and agitation speed.
	â€¢	Break Section 3: Fermentation into logical subsections (e.g., 3.1 Inoculation, 3.2 Temperature Control, 3.3 pH Adjustment, 3.4 Agitation, 3.5 Foam Control).
	â€¢	For each subsection, write one paragraph that describes:
	â€¢	The control objective
	â€¢	Setpoints or control bands
	â€¢	The control method (e.g., PID, on/off logic)
	â€¢	Any feedback sensors, interlocks, or alarm thresholds used to ensure safe and stable operation

â¸»

ðŸŸ¦ G (Goal)

Deliver a structured, detailed, and implementation-ready control narrative that helps automation engineers, operators, and system integrators understand how the fermentation stage is controlled, why it matters, and how the system should respond to deviationsâ€”ensuring safe, high-yield ethanol production.

**Section 1: Introduction**

1.1 Purpose

This document outlines the control narrative for an automated ethanol production process, focusing on the fermentation phase. The goal is to provide a detailed explanation of the control logic for key parameters, ensuring safe, stable, and high-yield ethanol production.

1.2 Scope

This control narrative covers the following aspects of the fermentation process:

- Inoculation
- Temperature control
- pH adjustment
- Agitation
- Foam management

**Section 2: System Overview**

2.1 Process Description

The ethanol production process involves several stages, including milling, mashing, boiling, fermentation, distillation, and dehydration. This control narrative focuses on the fermentation stage, where yeast converts sugars into ethanol and carbon dioxide.

2.2 Control System

The control system for the ethanol production process consists of:

- Programmable Logic Controller (PLC)
- Human-Machine Interface (HMI)
- Sensors for temperature, pH, agitation speed, and foam level
- Actuators for temperature control, pH adjustment, agitation, and foam management
- Safety interlocks and alarms

**Section 3: Fermentation Control**

3.1 Inoculation

Control Objective: Introduce the appropriate yeast strain into the fermentation vessel.

Setpoints:
- Inoculation rate: 10â€“15 billion cells/mL
- Inoculation temperature: 25â€“30â€¯Â°C

Control Method:
- Manual addition of yeast slurry
- Temperature control using a jacketed fermenter and chilled water or steam

Feedback Sensors:
- Temperature sensor
- pH sensor

Interlocks:
- Inoculation can only occur when the fermenter is at the desired temperature
- Alarm if the pH is outside the acceptable range during inoculation

3.2 Temperature Control

Control Objective: Maintain the fermentation temperature within the desired range to optimize yeast activity and ethanol production.
