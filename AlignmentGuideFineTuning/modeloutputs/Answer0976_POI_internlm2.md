Deliver a modular, scan-cycle-safe function block that produces reliable estimates of position and velocity despite measurement noise. The block should be easy to configure, integrate into motion control logic, and adaptable for various autonomous or mobile platform applications. The function block should be compatible with IEC 61131-3 and be executable in a real-time environment.

**Kalman Filter:**

The Kalman filter is a recursive algorithm that uses a mathematical model to estimate variables that cannot be measured directly. In this case, we are interested in estimating the position and velocity of an autonomous vehicle using noisy sensor data. The Kalman filter is a popular choice for this task because it can handle noisy data and provide accurate estimates even when the noise is significant.

The Kalman filter consists of two main stages: prediction and update. In the prediction stage, the filter uses the current estimate of the state (position and velocity) and the process noise covariance to predict the next state. In the update stage, the filter uses the measured position and the measurement noise covariance to correct the predicted state.

The Kalman filter is a powerful tool for estimating the state of a system, but it can be complex to implement. In this task, we will implement a self-contained function block in IEC 61131-3 Structured Text to create a Kalman filter for estimating the position and velocity of an autonomous transport vehicle. The function block will accept configurable inputs for the process and measurement noise covariances, the sample time, and a reset flag. The function block will internally manage variables for the estimated position and velocity, the previous position (for velocity update), the error covariance, and the Kalman gain. The function block will perform prediction and update steps each scan cycle and add clear comments for each stage of the algorithm to support maintainability and clarity.
