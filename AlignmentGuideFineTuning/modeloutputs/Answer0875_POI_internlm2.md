**Matrix Multiplication:**

Matrix multiplication is a fundamental operation in linear algebra and is widely used in various fields, including robotics, motion control, and transformation operations. The goal of this task is to create a function block in IEC 61131-3 Structured Text that performs the multiplication of two 4x4 matrices, MatrixA and MatrixB, and stores the result in MatrixC.

The function block, MatrixMultiply4x4, will have the following structure:

Inputs:
- MatrixA: ARRAY[1..4, 1..4] OF REAL
- MatrixB: ARRAY[1..4, 1..4] OF REAL

Output:
- MatrixC: ARRAY[1..4, 1..4] OF REAL

The implementation of the matrix multiplication logic will use three nested FOR loops. The outer loops iterate through the rows of MatrixA and the columns of MatrixB, while the inner loop performs the dot product and accumulates the result in MatrixC[i,j]. Here is an example of the code:

```
FOR i := 1 TO 4 DO
    FOR j := 1 TO 4 DO
        MatrixC[i,j] := 0;
        FOR k := 1 TO 4 DO
            MatrixC[i,j] := MatrixC[i,j] + MatrixA[i,k] * MatrixB[k,j];
        END_FOR;
    END_FOR;
END_FOR;
```

Each index in the loops represents a specific element in the matrices. The outer loops iterate through the rows and columns, while the inner loop performs the dot product for each element in MatrixC. The initialization of MatrixC[i,j] to zero ensures that the result is accurate and avoids any carryover from previous calculations.

The computational complexity of this algorithm is O(nÂ³), where n is the size of the matrices. This means that the time required to perform the multiplication increases exponentially with the size of the matrices. Scaling this approach to larger matrices may impact the scan time and require more resources for real-time systems.

To address these limitations, consider the following:

1. **Scaling to larger matrices:** As the size of the matrices increases, the scan time may become a bottleneck in real-time systems. To mitigate this, you can optimize the code by using SIMD (Single Instruction, Multiple Data) instructions or parallel processing
