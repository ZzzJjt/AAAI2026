ðŸŸ¥ Before â€“ The Context or Need

You have a Structured Text (IEC 61131-3) PLC program named UreaReactionControl, which manages a two-step urea synthesis process. The code controls the opening of ammonia and COâ‚‚ valves, monitors reactor pressure and temperature, and times the reaction. However, this logic is currently undocumented, making it harder for developers, maintainers, or auditors to understand and work with the process flow.

â¸»

ðŸŸ© After â€“ The Desired Output

Generate clear, developer-oriented documentation for the UreaReactionControl program. The documentation should explain:
	â€¢	Purpose of the program
	â€¢	Function of each variable (inputs, outputs, internal, and parameters)
	â€¢	Step-by-step description of the process flow:
	â€¢	Step 1: Loading raw materials
	â€¢	Step 2: Monitoring and controlling the reaction
	â€¢	Completion: Finalizing the reaction
	â€¢	Conditions under which valves are opened or closed
	â€¢	Timing and tolerance logic for pressure and temperature
	â€¢	Use of CURRENT_TIME for reaction timing

This documentation should enable new developers or automation engineers to quickly grasp the codeâ€™s intent and implementation.

ðŸŸ¦ Bridge â€“ How to Get There

Use the provided source code and:
	1.	Describe each code section (inputs, outputs, internal variables, constants)
	2.	Explain the logic in a narrative form: What happens first? What triggers transitions?
	3.	Include conditions and logic branches, like how temperature and pressure are validated
	4.	Highlight safety logic like valve shutoff and reaction completion
	5.	Format the result in a developer manual style, optionally including a table for parameters and a step flow diagram (if needed)

ðŸŸ¥ After â€“ The Output

**UreaReactionControl:**

**Purpose:**

This program automates the two-step urea synthesis process by controlling the opening of ammonia and COâ‚‚ valves, monitoring reactor pressure and temperature, and timing the reaction. It ensures that the reaction occurs within specified pressure and temperature tolerances and terminates when the reaction is complete.

**Inputs:**

* stAmmoniaValve: A Boolean variable that indicates whether the ammonia valve is open.
* stCO2Valve: A Boolean variable that indicates whether the COâ‚‚ valve is open.
* rCurrentPressure: A real variable that represents the current pressure in the reactor.
* rCurrentTemperature: A real variable that represents the current temperature in the reactor.

**Outputs:**

* stAmmoniaValveControl: A Boolean variable that indicates whether the ammonia valve should be opened or closed.
* stCO2ValveControl: A Boolean variable that indicates whether the COâ‚‚ valve should be opened or closed.

**Internal Variables:**

* stStep1: A Boolean variable that indicates whether the first step of the reaction (loading raw materials) has been completed.
* stStep2: A Boolean variable that indicates whether the second step of the reaction (controlling the reaction) has been completed.
* stReactionFinished: A Boolean variable that indicates whether the reaction has finished.

**Parameters:**

* rTargetPressure: A real constant that represents the target pressure for the reactor in bars.
* rPressureTolerance: A real constant that represents the pressure tolerance in bars.
* rTargetTemperature: A real constant that represents the target temperature for the reactor in Â°C.
* rTemperatureTolerance: A real constant that represents the temperature tolerance in Â°C.
* tReactionTime: A time constant that represents the total reaction time.
* tReactionTimer: A time variable that records the start time of the reaction.

**Process Flow:**

The program follows a sequential process flow:

1. **Step 1: Loading Raw Materials:**
	* If the ammonia valve is not open, it is opened.
	* If the COâ‚‚ valve is not open, it is opened.
	* If both valves are open, the first step is completed, and the reaction timer is started.

2. **Step 2: Cont
