⸻

🟧 S (Steps) – Steps to Perform
	1.	Outline the full beer brewing process, including stages such as mashing, lautering, boiling, fermentation, and packaging
	•	Provide concrete control values (e.g., mash temp = 65–68 °C, sparge water temp = 75–78 °C)
	2.	For Section 4: Lautering, include:
	•	Equipment: lauter tun, rake mechanism, sparge arm, pump
	•	Instrumentation: level sensor, turbidity meter, flow transmitter, temperature probe
	•	Control Steps:
	1.	Start recirculation loop
	2.	Monitor turbidity; continue until it drops below threshold
	3.	Begin wort transfer to kettle
	4.	Start sparge water flow while maintaining level
	5.	Monitor volume, flow rate, and turbidity
	6.	End lautering once volume is met and wort clarity is acceptable
	3.	Include logical triggers like:
	•	IF Turbidity > Limit THEN divert flow to waste
	•	IF Level < Minimum THEN stop sparge water

⸻

🟦 E (Expectation) – Expected Outcome

Produce a clear, structured control narrative that:
	•	Defines measurable control criteria for brewing stages
	•	Provides operators and automation engineers with step-by-step lautering logic
	•	Enhances reliability and repeatability of the brewing process
	•	Facilitates easy integration into PLC/HMI systems and operator training materials

\author{Control Engineer}
\date{}

\begin{document}

\maketitle

\begin{abstract}
This document provides a structured control narrative for the beer brewing process, with a focus on the lautering stage. It includes specific setpoints, equipment, instrumentation, and a detailed step-by-step sequence for lautering. The narrative is designed to support automation engineers, operators, and control system integration.

\section{Overview}
The beer brewing process consists of the following stages:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Mashing
\item Lautering
\item Boiling
\item Fermentation
\item Conditioning
\item Packaging
\end{enumerate}
This document focuses on the lautering stage (Section 4), which is critical for separating the wort from the spent grains.

\section{Lautering Process}
\subsection{Equipment}
The lautering process requires the following equipment:
\begin{itemize}
\item Lauter tun with rake mechanism
\item Sparge arm
\item Wort transfer pump
\item Level sensor (e.g., float switch or capacitance sensor)
\item Turbidity meter (e.g., Hach LF211)
\item Flow transmitter (e.g., Magnetrol 5800)
\item Temperature probe (e.g., PT100)
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Instrumentation}
The following instrumentation is used to monitor and control the lautering process:
\begin{itemize}
\item Turbidity Sensor: Measures the clarity of the wort. A turbidity threshold
