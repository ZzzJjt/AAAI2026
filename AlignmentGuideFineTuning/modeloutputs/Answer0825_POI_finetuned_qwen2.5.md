### Intent:
**Intent Summary:**  
Develop an IEC 61131-3 Structured Text function block to reliably read and validate five process values from an IO-Link master, with robust error handling and status reporting for communication integrity.  

*(Focus: IO-Link data acquisition, error management, real-time diagnostics in industrial control systems.)*

### Prompt:
**IO-Link Data Acquisition Using 61131-3 Structured Text:**

Develop a function block in structured text (ST) based on IEC 61131 standards to read five values from a remote IO-Link master. The function block should handle communication with the IO-Link master, retrieve the required process data, and provide the status of each read operation. Discuss the methodology used for error checking, status reporting, and handling of potential communication issues between the IO-Link master and the connected devices.

**T-A-G:**

ðŸŸ¥ T (Task) â€“ What You Need to Do

Develop an IEC 61131-3 Structured Text (ST) function block to acquire five process values from a remote IO-Link master device.

ðŸŸ© A (Action) â€“ How to Do It

Implement logic to establish and manage communication with the IO-Link master. Sequentially or concurrently read five data points, verify the integrity of each response, and return both the values and their respective status indicators. Integrate error detection and reporting mechanisms to handle communication issues, such as timeouts or data corruption.

ðŸŸ¦ G (Goal) â€“ What You Want to Achieve

Ensure accurate and reliable acquisition of IO-Link data, with clear status feedback for each value, enabling the controller to act on real-time diagnostics and maintain robust system behavior even in the presence of communication faults.

**R-I-S-E:**

ðŸŸ¥ R (Role) â€“ Your Role

You are a PLC programmer or automation engineer responsible for implementing IO-Link communication in a machine control system using IEC 61131 standards.

ðŸŸ© I (Input) â€“ What Youâ€™re Given

You need to read five process values from an IO-Link master device. The IO-Link protocol is already set up, and the IO-Link master supports standard communication with the connected devices.

ðŸŸ¦ S (Steps) â€“ How to Do It

	1.	Create a function block in IEC 61131-3 Structured Text to handle communication with the IO-Link master.
	2.	Implement a loop or sequence to read five values from the IO-Link master, one at a time.
	3.	For each read operation, check the status of the communication (e.g., timeout, error codes) and store the result along with the value.
	4.	Return both the process values and their corresponding status flags to the calling program.
	5.	Include detailed error handling and status reporting mechanisms to ensure that any communication issues are detected and appropriately managed.

ðŸŸ© E (Example) â€“ What It Should Look Like

	â€¢	Define a function block named ReadIOLinkValues that takes five input pins for the process values and five output pins for their statuses.
	â€¢	Implement a CASE statement inside the function block to sequentially read each value using the IO-Link protocol.
	â€¢	For each read operation, check the status of the communication and store the result in the corresponding output pins.
	â€¢	Return both the process values and their statuses to the calling program, ensuring that any communication errors are clearly indicated.

	â€¢	For instance, if the communication with the IO-Link master fails for a specific value, the status output for that value should be set to an error flag, while the process value is set to a default or invalid value.

	â€¢	Include detailed comments in the function block to explain the communication process, error handling, and status reporting mechanisms.

	â€¢	Compile and simulate the function block to ensure that it accurately reads five process values from the IO-Link master and provides reliable status information for each read operation.

	â€¢	Perform thorough testing to validate that the function block handles communication failures, provides accurate status reporting, and ensures that the calling program receives the correct information for further processing.

	â€¢	Once the function block is validated, integrate it into the machine
