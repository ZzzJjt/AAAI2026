ðŸŸ© T (Task) â€“ What You Need to Do

Develop a modular and efficient function block called SplineInterpolator that:
	â€¢	Performs cubic spline interpolation over a set of known data points
	â€¢	Accepts the following inputs:
	â€¢	X : ARRAY[1..N] OF REAL â€” known x-values
	â€¢	Y : ARRAY[1..N] OF REAL â€” known y-values
	â€¢	TargetX : REAL â€” x-position where the interpolated value is desired
	â€¢	Returns the following output:
	â€¢	InterpolatedY : REAL â€” the spline-interpolated result at TargetX

You should also:
	â€¢	Implement logic to:
	â€¢	Locate the correct interval [X[i], X[i+1]] for TargetX
	â€¢	Use precomputed spline coefficients (a, b, c, d)
	â€¢	Evaluate the cubic polynomial for that segment
	â€¢	Comment thoroughly to explain:
	â€¢	The mathematical foundation of cubic splines
	â€¢	How runtime evaluation is kept efficient
	â€¢	Any assumptions made (e.g. natural spline, clamped boundaries, etc.)
	â€¢	Address computational considerations:
	â€¢	Minimize memory by storing only necessary coefficients
	â€¢	Avoid real-time coefficient solvingâ€”prepare data during initialization

ðŸŸ§ F (Format) â€“ Expected Output

Your final function block should consist of:
	â€¢	IEC 61131-3 Structured Text code for real-time evaluation:
 InterpolatedY := A[i] + B[i]*(TargetX - X[i]) + C[i]*(TargetX - X[i])**2 + D[i]*(TargetX - X[i])**3;
 	â€¢	Inline documentation covering:
	â€¢	How and where spline coefficients should be calculated
	â€¢	Strategies for extending or limiting input arrays
	â€¢	Warnings about performance on low-power PLCs
	â€¢	Use cases such as:
	â€¢	Smooth actuator movement
	â€¢	Sensor calibration curves
	â€¢	Profile control in batch processes

In industrial automation, precise and smooth interpolation between data points is essential for applications such as sensor calibration, actuator control, and motion profiling. While linear interpolation is simple and fast, it often produces sharp transitions that are not suitable for applications requiring smooth control or accurate curve fitting.
