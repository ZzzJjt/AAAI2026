### Prompt:
**Ethernet PowerLink Diagnostics Using IEC 61131-3 Structured Text:**

Develop a function block in structured text (ST) based on IEC 61131 standards to retrieve Ethernet PowerLink diagnostic information from a control node device via a PowerLink managing node (MN). The function block should collect and display key diagnostic data such as communication status, error codes, and node health. The program must ensure that the diagnostic information is accurately processed and relayed to the controller for further analysis. Discuss how the function block interacts with the PowerLink network, handles error detection, and provides real-time diagnostics for maintaining network integrity.

**1. Introduction**

Ethernet PowerLink is a fieldbus protocol designed for industrial automation applications. It provides high-speed, deterministic communication and is widely used in various industries for real-time data exchange. The PowerLink protocol includes a managing node (MN) that oversees the network and provides diagnostic information about connected control nodes. This information is crucial for maintaining network integrity and ensuring reliable operation.

In this project, we will develop a function block in IEC 61131-3 Structured Text that retrieves and processes diagnostic data from a PowerLink control node via the MN. The function block will be responsible for cyclic polling, error detection, and outputting structured diagnostic information for fault monitoring and maintenance.

**2. Function Block Design**

The function block will have the following inputs:

- Node ID: A unique identifier for each control node in the PowerLink network.
- Communication Trigger: A Boolean input that initiates the cyclic polling process.

The function block will have the following outputs:

- Status: A Boolean output indicating the communication status with the control node.
- Error Codes: A list of error codes associated with the control node.
- Health Indicators: A set of health indicators representing the overall health of the control node.

**3. Cyclic Polling Logic**

The function block will implement a cyclic polling logic that queries the MN for diagnostic information related to connected control nodes. This logic will be triggered by the Communication Trigger input and will run at a predefined interval.

The cyclic polling logic will follow these steps:

1. Check the Communication Trigger input. If it is true, proceed to step 2; otherwise, wait for the next trigger.
2. Send a request to the MN to retrieve diagnostic information for the specified control node.
3. Wait for the response from the MN.
4. Parse and validate the returned diagnostic data.
5. Output the diagnostic results to the controller or HMI.
6. Repeat steps 2-5 until the Communication Trigger input is false.

**4. Data Parsing and Validation**

Upon receiving the diagnostic data from the MN, the function block will parse and validate the
