ðŸŸ¥ R (Role) â€“ Your Role

ðŸŸ© I (Input) â€“ What Youâ€™re Given

You are working with a standard PID function block, which includes the following key parameters and signals:
	â€¢	Inputs:
	â€¢	SP: Setpoint (desired value)
	â€¢	PV: Process Variable (measured value)
	â€¢	Kp, Ki, Kd: Proportional, Integral, and Derivative gains
	â€¢	MANUAL: Optional mode flag for manual override
	â€¢	LIMIT_HI, LIMIT_LO: Optional high/low output clamps
	â€¢	Outputs:
	â€¢	OUT: Control signal (e.g., to a valve or actuator)
	â€¢	ERROR: Difference between SP and PV
	â€¢	Optional: Status flags (e.g., output limited, saturated)

ðŸŸ§ S (Steps) â€“ What to Do
	1.	Configure your tuning parameters (Kp, Ki, Kd) based on the dynamics of your process.
	2.	Feed real-time values into the block:
	â€¢	SP: Your target process value (e.g., 75Â°C for a reactor)
	â€¢	PV: Your actual process value (e.g., from a temperature sensor)
	3.	The block automatically computes the error (SP - PV)
	4.	Internally, it calculates:
	â€¢	Proportional output = Kp * error
	â€¢	Integral output = sum of past errors (Ki * âˆ« error dt)
	â€¢	Derivative output = rate of change (Kd * d(error)/dt)
	5.	Combines the three terms to generate OUT
	6.	Applies output limiting, anti-windup, and optional manual control logic
	7.	Sends OUT to your actuator (e.g., control valve, pump, heater)

â¸»

ðŸŸ¦ E (Expectation) â€“ What You Should Achieve
	â€¢	Achieve stable and accurate control of your process variable (e.g., temperature, pressure, flow)
	â€¢	Minimize overshoot, undershoot, and steady-state error
	â€¢	Allow for real-time adaptation and continuous process optimization
	â€¢	Easily re-tune or adapt PID parameters for new process requirements
	â€¢	Reduce manual adjustments and improve system reliability and safety

ðŸŸ§ E (Example) â€“ Example Implementation

In an industrial PLC application, you might use the PID function block to regulate the flow rate of a chemical process. The process variable (PV) is the flow rate, and the setpoint (SP) is a desired flow rate. The proportional gain (Kp) is set to 0.5, the integral gain (Ki) is set to 0.01, and the derivative gain (Kd) is set to 0.001.

The PID function block continuously computes the error between the setpoint and the actual flow rate, and adjusts the control output accordingly. The control output is clamped between a high and low limit (LIMIT_HI and LIMIT_LO) to prevent overshooting or undershooting the setpoint.

The control output is sent to a flow control valve, which adjusts the flow rate to maintain the setpoint. The PLC continuously samples the process variable and updates the PID function block with the new value. The PID function block then computes the error and control output again, and adjusts the valve accordingly.
