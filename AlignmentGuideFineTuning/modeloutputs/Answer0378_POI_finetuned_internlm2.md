### Intent:
**Intent Summary:**  
Create a non-recursive, scan-cycle-safe quicksort function block in IEC 61131-3 Structured Text to efficiently sort integer arrays in PLC applications using stack-emulated iteration and Lomuto/Hoare partitioning.  

*(Key focus: Industrial-grade sorting without recursion, compliant with PLC constraints.)*

### Prompt:
**Quicksort:**
Implement a self-contained function block in IEC 61131-3 structured text to perform the quicksort algorithm on an array of integers. Ensure efficient partitioning and recursion handling.

**C-A-R-E:**

ðŸŸ¥ C (Context) â€“ Background Situation

Sorting integer arrays efficiently is a common requirement in PLC-based systemsâ€”for example, in alarm prioritization, measurement filtering, or report generation. While quicksort is a widely used and efficient algorithm, its typical implementation relies on recursion, which is not supported in many IEC 61131-3 Structured Text environments. Therefore, implementing quicksort for industrial controllers requires a scan-cycle-safe, non-recursive solution.

ðŸŸ© A (Action) â€“ Task to Perform

Develop a self-contained function block in Structured Text that implements the quicksort algorithm for an array of integers. The function block should:
	â€¢	Sort the array in place using an iterative approach
	â€¢	Replace recursive calls with stack-emulated logic (e.g., using two arrays for lower and upper bounds of subarrays)
	â€¢	Use an efficient partitioning scheme, such as Lomuto or Hoare
	â€¢	Include input signals like Execute : BOOL and output signals like Done : BOOL
	â€¢	Be written in a modular, structured style with inline comments for maintainability

â¸»

ðŸŸ¨ R (Result) â€“ Expected Outcome

The result will be a robust, scan-cycle-safe sorting block that can be reused in any PLC program requiring fast array sorting. It will:
	â€¢	Complete the sorting without recursion
	â€¢	Be efficient even for large arrays (e.g., 100+ elements)
	â€¢	Comply with IEC 61131-3 standards
	â€¢	Be easy to integrate, modify, or extend for future applications

ðŸŸ¦ E (Example) â€“ Concrete Illustration

Example logic for emulating recursion with a loop and index stack:

// Pseudocode structure inside the function block:
WHILE StackPointer > 0 DO
   Low := LowStack[StackPointer];
   High := HighStack[StackPointer];
   StackPointer := StackPointer - 1;

   IF Low < High THEN
      PartitionIndex := Partition(InputArray, Low, High);
      // Push left and right subarrays onto the stack
      StackPointer := StackPointer + 1;
      LowStack[StackPointer] := Low;
      HighStack[StackPointer] := PartitionIndex - 1;

      StackPointer := StackPointer + 1;
      LowStack[StackPointer] := PartitionIndex + 1;
      HighStack[StackPointer] := High;
   END_IF;
END_WHILE;

ðŸŸª A (Analysis) â€“ Decomposition into Smaller Steps

To implement quicksort in IEC 61131-3 Structured Text, follow these steps:

1.	Define the function block with input and output signals, including a Boolean Execute input to trigger the sorting process and a Boolean Done output to indicate when the sorting is complete.
2.	Create two arrays, LowStack and HighStack, to emulate the recursive call stack. Initialize LowStack with the lower bound of the array (0) and HighStack with the upper bound (array length â€“ 1).
3.	Implement a loop that continues until the stack is empty (LowStack[0] > 0). In each iteration, pop the lower and upper bounds from the stack.
4.	Partition the array using a chosen partitioning scheme (Lomuto or Hoare) and store the partition index in a variable.
5.	Push the left and right subarrays onto the stack by updating LowStack and HighStack accordingly.
6.	Repeat steps 3â€“5 until the stack is empty.
7.	Return the sorted array.

ðŸŸ© I (Insight) â€“ Key Point or Concept

The key insight is to use a stack-based approach to emulate recursion, which is necessary for implementing quicksort in IEC 61131-3 Structured Text without violating the scan-cycle safety constraints. By pushing and popping subarray bounds onto a stack, the sorting process can be iterated without relying on recursive function calls.

ðŸŸ¥ C (Conclusion) â€“ Final Thoughts

Implementing quicksort in IEC 61131-3 Structured Text requires a non-recursive, stack-based approach to ensure compliance with PLC constraints. By following the steps outlined above, you can create a self-contained function block that efficiently sorts integer arrays in industrial control systems. This approach allows for efficient sorting without the overhead of recursive function calls, making it suitable for real-time applications in PLC environments.
