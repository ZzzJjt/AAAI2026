3. **MPC Algorithm Development:**
   - Define the objective function, which could be energy efficiency or other relevant performance metric.
   - Develop constraints based on operational limits, such as minimum and maximum turbine speeds or temperatures.
   - Choose an appropriate optimization method, such as linear programming or quadratic programming, for the MPC algorithm.

4. **Implementation and Optimization:**
   - Implement the MPC algorithm in Python, using libraries like NumPy, SciPy, and Pyomo for optimization and mathematical modeling.
   - Optimize the algorithm for real-time performance, considering factors like computational efficiency and response time.

5. **Validation and Testing:**
   - Validate the performance of the MPC system using real-world data and comparing it to traditional control methods.
   - Test the system under varying load conditions and disturbances to demonstrate its adaptability and robustness.

6. **Integration and Deployment:**
   - Integrate the MPC system into the existing control framework of the thermal power plant.
   - Deploy the system and monitor its performance over time, making adjustments as necessary to maintain optimal efficiency.
