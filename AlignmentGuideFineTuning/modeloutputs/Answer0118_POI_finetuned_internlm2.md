### Intent:
**Intent Summary:**

### Prompt:
**PID Temperature Control Gas Turbine:**

Develop a self-contained IEC 61131-3 Structured Text program to implement PID feedback control for regulating the temperature inside a gas turbine. The control program should manage the opening of an inlet valve based on a temperature setpoint, ensuring that the PID controller adjusts the valve position to maintain optimal turbine performance.

The program should include the necessary PID parameters (proportional, integral, and derivative gains) and logic to handle deviations from the temperature setpoint. Also, incorporate limits on the valve opening to ensure safe operation. Discuss the challenges of temperature regulation in gas turbines, focusing on system dynamics, response time, and maintaining stability under varying load conditions.

**B-A-B:**

🟥 B (Before) – The Challenge

In gas turbines, precise temperature control is essential for performance optimization, component protection, and emissions compliance. Fluctuations in turbine temperature due to load changes or fuel variability can lead to inefficiency, overheating, or mechanical damage. Manual control or poorly tuned systems may struggle to maintain stable turbine conditions, especially under dynamic operating profiles.
