**R-I-S-E:**

ðŸŸ¥ R (Role) â€“ Define Your Role

Act as a process control engineer developing a detailed and structured control narrative for an ethanol production system, with a focus on the fermentation phase.

ðŸŸ© I (Input) â€“ Information Provided

You are asked to:
	â€¢	Create a control narrative for the overall ethanol production process, including concrete setpoints and control ranges for critical parameters.
	â€¢	Focus particularly on Section 3: Fermentation, which should be broken down into multiple subsections (e.g., temperature control, pH regulation, inoculation, agitation).
	â€¢	For each subsection, write one paragraph explaining the control logic, target setpoints, equipment used, and any interlocks or alarms.

ðŸŸ§ S (Steps) â€“ Steps to Perform
	1.	Define key control variables and parameters for the fermentation process:
	â€¢	Temperature: e.g., 32â€“35Â°C
	â€¢	pH: e.g., 4.5â€“5.0
	â€¢	Agitation speed: e.g., 100â€“150 RPM
	2.	Break Section 3 into logical control topics such as:
	â€¢	3.1 Inoculation Control
	â€¢	3.2 Temperature Regulation
	â€¢	3.3 pH Control
	â€¢	3.4 Agitation/Mixing
	â€¢	3.5 Foam Control
	3.	For each subsection, describe the control objective, specific control ranges/setpoints, and how each is managed using automation tools or manual intervention.
	4.	Include details on alarms, interlocks, and safety considerations for deviations.
	5.	Ensure clarity and standard format so it can be used in automation design, HMI programming, and operator training.

ðŸŸ¦ E (Expectation) â€“ Expected Outcome

Deliver a clear, structured, and technically accurate control narrative for the ethanol fermentation process. The document should help guide automation engineers, plant operators, and regulatory reviewers in understanding:
	â€¢	What is controlled
	â€¢	Why it is controlled
	â€¢	How it is controlled
	â€¢	What happens when setpoints are violated

Each paragraph should act as a standalone reference for implementation or troubleshooting.

Certainly! Below is a detailed control narrative for an ammonium nitrate reactor, focusing on Section 3: Reactor Control, which includes specific setpoints, instrumentation, operating procedures, and safety interlocks.

### Control Narrative for Ammonium Nitrate Reactor

#### Overview
The ammonium nitrate reactor is a continuous-flow reactor that produces ammonium nitrate by reacting ammonia and nitric acid in a controlled environment. The reactor operates at a fixed temperature and pressure, with precise control of flow rates and pH to ensure safe and efficient operation.

#### Section 1: Reactor Vessel
- **Setpoint**: 
  - **Temperature**: 175Â°C Â± 2Â°C
  - **Pressure**: 12.5 bar Â± 0.5 bar
- **Instrumentation**:
  - **Temperature Transmitter (TT-101)**: Measures reactor temperature.
  - **Pressure Transmitter (PT-102)**: Measures reactor pressure.
  - **Flow Transmitter (FT-103)**: Measures ammonia and nitric acid flow rates.
  - **pH Transmitter (pHT-104)**: Measures reactor pH.
- **Operating Procedure**:
  1. Start feed of ammonia and nitric acid at controlled flow rates.
  2. Monitor temperature and pressure using TT-101 and PT-102.
  3. Adjust ammonia and nitric acid flow rates as needed to maintain target pressure.
  4. Maintain temperature using steam or cooling water as required.
  5. Maintain pH between 5.5 and 6.5 using ammonium hydroxide or nitric acid as needed.
- **Safety Interlocks**:
  - **High Temperature Shutdown**: If temperature exceeds 185Â°C, shut down the reactor, close feed valves, and activate cooling system.
  - **High Pressure Shutdown**: If pressure exceeds 13 bar, shut down the reactor, close feed valves, and activate pressure relief valve.
  - **Low Flow Interlock**: If
