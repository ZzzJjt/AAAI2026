### Intent:
**Intent Summary:**  
Implement a heap sort algorithm in IEC 61131-3 Structured Text as a reusable function block for sorting integer arrays on a PLC, with phased execution to ensure real-time safety and deterministic behavior.

### Prompt:
**Kalman Filter:**
Implement a self-contained function block in IEC 61131-3 structured text to create a Kalman filter for estimating the position and velocity of an autonomous transport vehicle. Include configurable parameters for noise covariance and initial conditions.

**R-I-S-E:**

ðŸŸ¥ R (Role) â€“ Define Your Role

Act as a control systems engineer developing a Kalman filter function block in IEC 61131-3 Structured Text for real-time state estimation of an autonomous vehicleâ€™s position and velocity on a PLC.

â¸»

ðŸŸ© I (Input) â€“ Information Provided

You are tasked with implementing a discrete-time Kalman filter that:
	â€¢	Estimates position and velocity based on noisy position measurements
	â€¢	Accepts configurable parameters including:
	â€¢	Process noise covariance (Q)
	â€¢	Measurement noise covariance (R)
	â€¢	Sample time (DeltaT)
	â€¢	Initial position and velocity
	â€¢	Must be written in Structured Text without matrix libraries
	â€¢	Should be modular and suitable for scan-cycle-based PLC execution

â¸»

ðŸŸ§ S (Steps) â€“ Steps to Perform
	1.	Define the function block interface with inputs:
	â€¢	MeasuredPosition : REAL
	â€¢	Q, R : REAL (noise covariances)
	â€¢	DeltaT : REAL (sample time)
	â€¢	Reset : BOOL
	2.	Internally store:
	â€¢	Estimated position (x_est_pos) and velocity (x_est_vel)
	â€¢	Previous position (x_est_prev)
	â€¢	Error covariance (p)
	â€¢	Kalman gain (k)
	3.	Implement the prediction step:
	â€¢	Predict new position based on current velocity
	â€¢	Update error covariance with Q
	4.	Implement the correction step:
	â€¢	Compute Kalman gain
	â€¢	Update position with measurement
	â€¢	Estimate velocity based on position change
	â€¢	Update error covariance with R
	5.	Add reset logic and initialize all states on Reset = TRUE
	6.	Ensure the block executes within one scan cycle with safe real-time behavior

ðŸŸ¦ E (Expectation) â€“ Expected Outcome

Deliver a modular, scan-safe Kalman filter function block that provides accurate and noise-tolerant estimates of an autonomous vehicleâ€™s position and velocity. The block should be easily reusable, configurable via Q and R, and ready for integration into industrial motion control systems on PLC hardware.

```

This function block implements a discrete-time Kalman filter for estimating the position and velocity of an autonomous vehicle based on noisy position measurements. It includes configurable parameters for noise covariance and initial conditions, and is designed to be executed within one scan cycle with safe real-time behavior.

To use this function block, simply call the `Execute` procedure with the required inputs. The estimated position and velocity will be available in the `x_est_pos` and `x_est_vel` variables, respectively.
