### Intent:
**Intent Summary:**  
Generate a NORSOK-compliant textual System Control Diagram (SCD) for an LNG vaporizer system, including instrumentation tags, control loops, interlocks, and piping flow, to ensure operational safety and automation readiness.  

*(Focused on structured textual representation for control logic, aligned with NORSOK standards.)*

### Prompt:
**SCD LNG Vaporizer:**

Create a NORSOK system control diagram (SCD) in textual notation for a LNG Vaporizer System. Include instrumentation, control loops, and interlocks. Provide concrete tag numbers and piping.


**B-A-B:**

🟥 B (Before) – The Problem or Challenge

Designing a NORSOK-compliant System Control Diagram (SCD) for a LNG vaporizer system is essential for ensuring operational safety, process transparency, and automation readiness. In many early-stage projects or documentation scenarios, engineers need a textual representation of the control diagram when graphical tools aren’t available. Without a structured textual format—including piping, instrumentation, and interlocks—it can be difficult to communicate control logic clearly across disciplines or trace compliance with standards.

🟩 A (After) – The Desired Outcome

Create a NORSOK-style System Control Diagram (SCD) using textual notation for a LNG vaporizer system. This diagram should:
	•	Include major process elements (e.g., LNG feed lines, vaporizers, heaters, gas outlet)
	•	Represent instrumentation and control loops with realistic tag numbers (e.g., TT101, FIC202, PSV301)
	•	Clearly document interlocks (e.g., pressure high-high trip, ESD logic)
	•	Indicate piping flow using arrows (-->) and group control functions logically (e.g., temperature control loop, flow regulation, safety shutdowns)

The result will be a functional, plain-text SCD layout that can support control system development and safety verification.

🟧 B (Bridge) – How to Get There
	1.	Define process flow from LNG inlet → vaporizer → pressure regulation → gas outlet.
	2.	Assign and place instrumentation:
	•	Temperature loop: TT101 → TIC101 → Heater Control Valve (TCV101)
	•	Flow loop: FT201 → FIC201 → FCV201
	•	Safety: PSH301 (Pressure Switch High) → ESD1
	3.	Use NORSOK-style loop and tag conventions (e.g., P&ID cross-references like U-610, L-120).
	4.	Format in readable text with logical grouping and indentation. Example:

 LNG Inlet --> FT201 --> FIC201 --> FCV201 --> Vaporizer
                                       |
                                       --> TT101 --> TIC101 --> TCV101
                                               |
                                               --> PSH301 --> ESD1

                                               --> PSH303 --> ESD3

	5.	Include interlocks:
	•	ESD1: If PSH301 (High pressure) AND PSH302 (High temperature), shutdown vaporizer.
	•	ESD2: If PSH301 (High pressure) AND PSH303 (Low flow), shutdown vaporizer.
	•	ESD3: If PSH302 (High temperature) AND PSH303 (Low flow), shutdown vaporizer.

By following these steps, you can create a NORSOK-compliant textual System Control Diagram (SCD) for a LNG vaporizer system.
