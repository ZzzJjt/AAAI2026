### Intent:
**Intent Summary:**  
Develop a self-contained IEC 61131-3 Structured Text program for cascade control of a heat exchanger, where an outer loop adjusts temperature setpoints and an inner loop regulates heating medium flow, using proportional control with example tuning values (e.g., `Kp_Outer := 1.0`), prioritizing fast inner-loop response and modular code structure.  

*(Key focus: Cascade control, temperature/flow loops, real-time execution, and readability.)*

### Prompt:
**Cascade Control Heat Exchanger:**

Develop a self-contained IEC 61131-3 Structured Text program (not a function block) to implement cascade control for regulating the temperature in a heat exchanger. The outer loop should control the temperature setpoint based on the process requirements, while the inner loop controls the flow rate of the heating medium to adjust the temperature dynamically.

The program should manage the interaction between the primary and secondary control loops, ensuring that the inner loop responds quickly to disturbances, while the outer loop provides overall temperature stability. Include typical parameter values for temperature control and flow adjustments, and discuss the advantages of using cascade control in heat exchanger systems, particularly in improving response times and maintaining stable temperature control under varying load conditions.

**Additional Information:**

**Cascade Control:**

Cascade control is a control strategy that uses two or more control loops to regulate a process variable. In this case, the outer loop controls the temperature setpoint based on the process requirements, while the inner loop controls the flow rate of the heating medium to adjust the temperature dynamically.

**Temperature Control:**

The temperature control loop is responsible for maintaining the outlet temperature of the heat exchanger at a desired setpoint. The setpoint is determined by the process requirements and is typically specified in degrees Celsius or Fahrenheit. The temperature of the outlet stream is measured using a temperature sensor and compared to the setpoint to determine the temperature error.

**Flow Control:**

The flow control loop is responsible for adjusting the flow rate of the heating medium to maintain the temperature setpoint. The flow rate is measured using a flow sensor and compared to the setpoint to determine the flow error. The flow error is then used to adjust the flow rate of the heating medium using a control valve.

**Proportional Control:**

Proportional control is a type of control strategy that uses the error between the setpoint and the process variable to adjust the output of the controller. The output is proportional to the error, and the controller gain determines the strength of the response. In this case, the controller gain for the outer loop is Kp_Outer, and the controller gain for the inner loop is Kp_Inner.

**Real-time Execution:**

Real-time execution is important in control systems because it ensures that the control actions are taken in a timely manner to maintain the stability of the process. In this case, the inner loop should run faster and stabilize the flow before the outer loop updates the temperature target. This ensures that the temperature setpoint is adjusted based on the most recent flow measurements, which improves the accuracy and stability of the control system.

**Code Structure:**

The code structure should be modular, readable, and expandable. This means that the code should be organized into logical blocks that are easy to understand and modify. The code should also be commented to explain the purpose of each block and the values of any variables used. This makes the code easier to maintain and extend in the future.

**Advantages of Cascade Control:**

Cascade control has several advantages over other control strategies, including:
	â€¢	Improved response time: The inner loop responds quickly to disturbances, which improves the overall response time of the control system.
	â€¢	Improved stability: The outer loop provides overall temperature stability
