### Intent:
**Intent Summary:**  
Generate a 30-entry I/O list table for a steel rolling mill, specifying signal names, types (input/output, analog/digital), engineering units, ranges, setpoints, and P&ID references for PLC/HMI integration.  

*(Context: Industrial control system documentation for instrumentation and automation teams.)*

### Prompt:
**IO List Rolling Mill:**

Create an I/O list as a table with 30 lines for a rolling mill in a steel production plant. Have as columns signal name, input/output, signal tagnumber, analog/digital, engineering unit, ranges, setpoint, and P&ID reference.

**R-I-S-E:**

ðŸŸ¥ R (Role) â€“ Define Your Role

Act as an industrial control engineer preparing the I/O specification for a rolling mill system in a steel production plant, ensuring clarity for instrumentation, automation, and electrical integration teams.

â¸»

ðŸŸ© I (Input) â€“ Information Provided

You are to create a detailed I/O list for the rolling mill that includes 30 signal entries. Each entry should include the following columns:
	â€¢	Signal Name
	â€¢	Input/Output
	â€¢	Signal Tagnumber
	â€¢	Analog/Digital
	â€¢	Engineering Unit
	â€¢	Range
	â€¢	Setpoint
	â€¢	P&ID Reference

The list should reflect real-world rolling mill variables such as roll speed, motor torque, cooling system actuation, gap feedback, and tension control.

ðŸŸ§ S (Steps) â€“ Implementation Steps
	1.	Identify 30 key control and monitoring signals commonly used in rolling mills.
	2.	For each signal, define:
	â€¢	Whether it is an input (sensor) or output (actuator)
	â€¢	Its analog/digital type
	â€¢	Engineering units (e.g., mm, Â°C, bar, m/min)
	â€¢	Typical range and control setpoint
	â€¢	A unique tag number (e.g., RM1001)
	â€¢	P&ID reference for traceability
	3.	Format the list as a structured table suitable for use in Excel, documentation, or PLC tag import.
	4.	Ensure consistency, clarity, and relevance to real plant instrumentation.

â¸»

ðŸŸ¦ E (Expectation) â€“ Expected Outcome

Deliver a professional, standardized I/O list that:
	â€¢	Covers 30 essential signals used in rolling mill operations
	â€¢	Provides all necessary metadata for PLC configuration, field wiring, and HMI integration
	â€¢	Aligns with best practices for project documentation, P&ID traceability, and commissioning support
