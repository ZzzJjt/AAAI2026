### Intent:
**Intent Summary:**  
Design and implement a structured IEC 61131-3 control program for the startup sequence of a Valmet paper machineâ€™s press section, ensuring synchronized roll activation, gradual speed/pressure/temperature ramp-up, and safety interlocks to prevent sheet/equipment damage.

### Prompt:
**Startup Paper Machine:**

Develop a detailed startup sequence for the press section of a Valmet paper machine, specifying typical parameter values such as press roll speed, nip pressure, and temperature settings. The sequence should include the step-by-step activation of the press section components, ensuring proper synchronization between the rolls and conveyors, and gradually ramping up to the operational speed.

Write a self-contained IEC 61131-3 Structured Text program to control this startup sequence. The program should include logic for managing interlocks, safety checks, and smooth transitions between startup phases. Discuss the significance of maintaining optimal nip pressure and temperature throughout the process to prevent damage to the paper sheet and equipment.

**T-A-G:**

ðŸŸ¥ T (Task)

Design a startup control sequence for the press section of a Valmet paper machine, and implement it in IEC 61131-3 Structured Text.

â¸»

ðŸŸ© A (Action)

Develop a structured startup routine that includes:
	â€¢	Step-by-step activation of press rolls and conveyors
	â€¢	Controlled ramp-up of press roll speed (e.g., up to 500 m/min)
	â€¢	Gradual increase of nip pressure (e.g., to 250 kN/m)
	â€¢	Regulation of temperature (e.g., to 85â€“90Â°C)
	â€¢	Synchronization between rolls and conveyors to ensure smooth web handling
	â€¢	Safety checks and interlocks before and during operation
	â€¢	Clearly defined transitions between phases using timers and conditional logic

Then, write a self-contained Structured Text program that encapsulates all logic for sequencing, control, and safety. Include in-line comments and modular code blocks for clarity and maintainability.

Also, explain in your code or accompanying notes why maintaining optimal nip pressure and temperature is critical to avoiding paper sheet damage and ensuring mechanical integrity.

â¸»

ðŸŸ¦ G (Goal)

Deliver a modular, safe, and industry-ready control program that ensures the press section starts smoothly, with synchronized motion, stable pressure and temperature, and proper startup sequencing in compliance with industrial automation best practices.
