Deliver a modular, efficient, and scan-cycle-safe Structured Text function block that enables fast data lookup on PLCs. The function should be reliable, easy to reuse, and support safe operation within industrial real-time control systems.

**Input Validation:**
Validate the input array to ensure it is sorted and contains no duplicate values. This will prevent the function from returning incorrect results or causing unexpected behavior.

**Efficient Boundary Handling:**
Handle the search boundaries efficiently to avoid unnecessary calculations and improve performance. This can be achieved by using the midpoint of the search window as the starting point for the search, and adjusting the boundaries as needed based on the result of the comparison.

**Reliable PLC-based Data Lookup:**
Ensure that the function is reliable and safe to use in a PLC-based control system. This can be achieved by using proper input validation, efficient boundary handling, and scan-cycle-safe programming techniques.

**Maintainability and Clarity:**
Include comments explaining each step of the logic for maintainability and clarity. This will make it easier for other developers to understand and modify the code in the future.

**Modular and Reusable:**
Make the function block self-contained and modular, so it can be easily reused in other projects. This will save time and effort in the long run.

**Scan-Cycle-Safe:**
Ensure that the function is scan-cycle-safe, so it can be used in real-time control systems without causing timing issues or other problems. This can be achieved by using proper programming techniques and avoiding unnecessary calculations.

**Efficient Performance:**
