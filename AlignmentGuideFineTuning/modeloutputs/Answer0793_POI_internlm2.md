Section 3: Fermentation

3.1 Temperature Control
The primary objective of temperature control during fermentation is to maintain a consistent and optimal temperature range for the yeast to perform its metabolic activity. The target temperature range for fermentation is 32â€“35â€¯Â°C. The control strategy involves a PID (Proportional-Integral-Derivative) loop that monitors the temperature of the fermenter using a temperature sensor. The control system adjusts the heating or cooling system to maintain the setpoint within the specified range. If the temperature deviates from the setpoint by more than Â±1â€¯Â°C, an alarm is triggered, and the control system initiates a corrective action, such as increasing or decreasing the heating or cooling rate. In case of a severe deviation, the control system can shut down the fermentation process to prevent damage to the yeast or the fermenter.

3.2 pH Regulation
The pH of the fermentation broth is critical for the yeast's metabolic activity. The target pH range for fermentation is 4.5â€“5.0. The control strategy involves a pH controller that monitors the pH of the fermenter using a pH probe. The control system adjusts the pH by adding or removing acid or base, depending on the deviation from the setpoint. If the pH deviates from the setpoint by more than Â±0.1 pH units, an alarm is triggered, and the control system initiates a corrective action, such as increasing or decreasing the acid or base feed rate. In case of a severe deviation, the control system can shut down the fermentation process to prevent damage to the yeast or the fermenter.

3.3 Inoculation
The inoculation process involves introducing the yeast culture into the fermenter. The control strategy involves a timer that activates the inoculation process at the specified time. The control system ensures that the inoculation process is completed within the specified timeframe. If the inoculation process dev
