**T-A-G:**

ðŸŸ¥ T (Task)

Design a self-contained Kalman filter function block in IEC 61131-3 Structured Text to estimate the position and velocity of an autonomous transport vehicle using noisy sensor input.

ðŸŸ© A (Action)
	â€¢	Implement a discrete-time, 2-state Kalman filter using only scalar arithmetic, avoiding matrix operations or recursion
	â€¢	Accept configurable inputs:
	â€¢	MeasuredPosition : REAL
	â€¢	Q : REAL â€“ process noise covariance
	â€¢	R : REAL â€“ measurement noise covariance
	â€¢	DeltaT : REAL â€“ sample time
	â€¢	Reset : BOOL â€“ to reinitialize state
	â€¢	Internally manage variables for:
	â€¢	Estimated position and velocity
	â€¢	Previous position (for velocity update)
	â€¢	Error covariance and Kalman gain
	â€¢	Perform prediction and update steps each scan cycle
	â€¢	Add clear comments for each stage of the algorithm to support maintainability and clarity

ðŸŸ¦ G (Goal)

Deliver a modular, scan-cycle-safe function block that produces reliable estimates of position and velocity despite measurement noise. The block should be easy to configure, integrate into motion control logic, and adaptable for various autonomous or mobile platform applications.

**Design Considerations:**

â€¢	The Kalman filter is a recursive algorithm that uses a prediction step to estimate the next state based on the current state and a process model, and an update step to incorporate new measurements and refine the estimate.
â€¢	The prediction step uses the process model to predict the next state based on the current state and the process noise covariance.
â€¢	The update step uses the new measurement and the measurement noise covariance to refine the estimate and calculate the Kalman gain.
â€¢	The Kalman gain is used to balance the influence of the prediction and the measurement in the updated estimate.
â€¢	The error covariance is used to represent the uncertainty in the estimate and is updated in each step.
â€¢	The Kalman filter is a powerful tool for estimating the state of a system in the presence of noise and uncertainty, and is widely used in a variety of applications.
