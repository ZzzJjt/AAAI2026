### Intent:
**Intent Summary:**  
Develop a Structured Text function block (`SimplexSolver`) implementing the Simplex algorithm for linear programming on PLCs, handling constraints and objective functions with detailed comments, while addressing PLC-specific limitations like memory, precision, and real-time execution for industrial optimization tasks (e.g., energy or material blending).  

*(Focus: PLC-optimized LP solver with robustness for embedded constraints.)*

### Prompt:
**Linear Programming:**

Develop a self-contained function block in IEC 61131-3 Structured Text to solve a linear programming problem using the simplex method. Ensure the function block is designed to handle multiple constraints and objective functions, with detailed comments explaining the algorithm and each computational step. Discuss the limitations of implementing linear programming in a PLC environment, particularly with respect to memory and processing power, and provide examples of how this function block could be applied in industrial optimization scenarios.

	â€¢	Tableau setup
	â€¢	Pivot column and row selection
	â€¢	Row operations and update rules
	â€¢	Is optimized for PLC constraints, including:
	â€¢	Bounded array sizes (e.g., max 5x5)
	â€¢	Limited floating-point accuracy
	â€¢	Real-time scan-time execution

You should also discuss limitations such as:
