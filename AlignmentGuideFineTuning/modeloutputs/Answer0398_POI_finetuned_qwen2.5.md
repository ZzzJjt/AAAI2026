### Intent:
The task is to **generate a textual Process Flow Diagram (PFD) for penicillin fermentation, detailing unit operations, material flows, instrumentation (e.g., sensors, controllers), and control logic (PID loops, alarms, interlocks) to ensure process stability and safety**.  

*(Intent: Structured documentation of process design and automation for penicillin production.)*

### Prompt:
**PFD Penicillin Fermentation:**

Create a Process Flow Diagram (PFD) in textual notation for a fermentation process to produce penicillin. Include instrumentation and control philosophy.

**C-A-R-E:**

ðŸŸ¥ C (Context) â€“ Background Situation

In the design of a penicillin fermentation process, itâ€™s essential to document the material flow, process units, and control mechanisms in a clear and structured way. Traditionally, this is done through graphical Process Flow Diagrams (PFDs). However, in environments without graphic capabilitiesâ€”such as early-phase engineering, text-based collaboration, or version-controlled documentationâ€”engineers rely on textual notation to convey process structure and control philosophy.

ðŸŸ© A (Action) â€“ Task to Perform

Create a Process Flow Diagram (PFD) in textual notation for a penicillin fermentation process. The diagram should:
	â€¢	List and connect major unit operations (e.g., media prep, sterilization, fermentation, separation)
	â€¢	Show material flow using directional arrows (-->)
	â€¢	Include key instrumentation (e.g., TT for temperature, pH for acidity, LT for level) with example tag numbers
	â€¢	Describe the control philosophy for critical stages, such as how temperature, pH, or agitation is maintained and controlled using loops (e.g., TT101 â†’ TIC101 â†’ TC101)

â¸»

ðŸŸ¨ R (Result) â€“ Expected Outcome

The result will be a clearly formatted, plain-text PFD that captures the essential structure of the penicillin production process, including flow paths and control logic. It will be suitable for:
	â€¢	Cross-functional communication
	â€¢	Early-phase process design
	â€¢	Input to automation system configuration
	â€¢	Integration with control narratives and I/O lists
