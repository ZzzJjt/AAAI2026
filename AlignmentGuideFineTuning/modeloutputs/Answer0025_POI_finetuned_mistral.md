### Intent:
**Intent Summary:**  
Develop an IEC 61131-3 Structured Text function block to reliably read five process values from a remote IO-Link master, with error handling and status reporting for robust industrial communication.  

*(Focus: Data acquisition, fault tolerance, and diagnostics for IO-Link devices.)*

### Prompt:
**IO-Link Data Acquisition Using 61131-3 Structured Text:**

Develop a function block in structured text (ST) based on IEC 61131 standards to read five values from a remote IO-Link master. The function block should handle communication with the IO-Link master, retrieve the required process data, and provide the status of each read operation. Discuss the methodology used for error checking, status reporting, and handling of potential communication issues between the IO-Link master and the connected devices.

**B-A-B:**

ðŸŸ¥ B (Before) â€“ The Challenge

In industrial automation systems using IO-Link, acquiring data from a remote IO-Link master can be error-prone without a standardized approach. Communication issues, inconsistent data retrieval, and lack of status reporting make it difficult to ensure reliable interaction with IO-Link devices and affect overall system diagnostics and responsiveness.

ðŸŸ© A (After) â€“ The Ideal Outcome

Develop an IEC 61131-3 Structured Text (ST) function block that communicates with a remote IO-Link master to read five process values. The function block should ensure proper data acquisition, provide clear status indicators for each read operation, and include built-in error detection to ensure robust and fault-tolerant communication.

ðŸŸ§ B (Bridge) â€“ The Implementation Strategy

Design the function block with input parameters for initiating the read process and identifying target IO-Link channels. Implement logic to sequentially or concurrently request data from the IO-Link master, capture the results, and store the values in output variables. Include detailed status flags for each read (e.g., success, timeout, communication error) and integrate error-handling routines that retry reads or notify the controller of failuresâ€”ensuring reliable data acquisition and system transparency.
