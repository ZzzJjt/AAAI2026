### Intent:
**Intent Summary:**  
Develop an IEC 61131-3 Structured Text function block to compute the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) for real-time signal analysis on PLCs, optimizing for industrial constraints (fixed input sizes, deterministic execution) with detailed algorithmic comments and diagnostic considerations.  

**Key Focus:**  
Efficient radix-2 FFT implementation, real-time suitability, and practical use cases (e.g., vibration analysis).

### Prompt:
**Fast Fourier Transform:**

Develop a self-contained function block in IEC 61131-3 Structured Text to compute the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) of a given input array. Ensure that the implementation is efficient and includes detailed comments explaining the algorithmic steps involved in computing the FFT. Discuss any limitations in terms of computational complexity and real-time performance, as well as considerations for handling input size constraints typically found in industrial control systems.

ðŸŸ¥ R (Role) â€“ Your Role

You are a PLC software developer or automation engineer tasked with implementing a Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) function for real-time signal analysis on a programmable logic controller using IEC 61131-3 Structured Text.

ðŸŸ© T (Task) â€“ What You Need to Do

Develop a self-contained function block called FFT_Block that:
	â€¢	Accepts a fixed-size input array of REAL numbers (e.g., InputSignal: ARRAY[1..64] OF REAL)
	â€¢	Computes the Fast Fourier Transform using an efficient algorithm such as the Cooley-Tukey radix-2 method
	â€¢	Outputs either the magnitude spectrum or real and imaginary components
	â€¢	Includes detailed comments explaining each step in the algorithm (e.g., bit-reversal, butterfly computation, twiddle factor application)
	â€¢	Ensures the implementation is optimized for:
	â€¢	Memory and processing constraints of industrial PLCs
	â€¢	Deterministic execution time suitable for real-time control loops
	â€¢	Handles fixed input sizes and includes fallback or diagnostic behavior in case of input issues

Also, include a brief explanation discussing:
	â€¢	Limitations regarding input size, numerical precision, and scan time impact
	â€¢	Practical use cases such as vibration diagnostics, motor frequency analysis, or filter design
