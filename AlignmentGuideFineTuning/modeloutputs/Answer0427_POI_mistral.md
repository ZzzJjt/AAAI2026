### Intent:
"Implement a Python-based model predictive control system for robot navigation that optimizes trajectory planning with dynamic constraints and obstacle avoidance in changing environments."

### Prompt:
**Model Predictive Control for Optimizing Robot Movement Using Python:**

Develop Python code to implement a model predictive control (MPC) algorithm for optimizing the movement of a robot. The control system should consider dynamic constraints, path planning, and obstacle avoidance while ensuring smooth, efficient, and adaptive movement in a dynamic environment.

**R-I-S-E:**

ðŸŸ¥ Rï¼ˆRoleï¼‰

Act as a robotics engineer specializing in motion planning and predictive control using Python.

ðŸŸ© Iï¼ˆInputï¼‰

You are tasked with developing a motion control system for a mobile robot navigating in a dynamic environment. The robot must move efficiently while avoiding obstacles and adhering to dynamic constraints such as speed limits, turning radius, and changing surroundings.

ðŸŸ§ Sï¼ˆStepsï¼‰
	1.	Model the robotâ€™s motion dynamics in Python, including constraints on acceleration, velocity, and orientation.
	2.	Implement a model predictive control (MPC) algorithm that plans the robotâ€™s trajectory over a prediction horizon.
	3.	Integrate obstacle detection and avoidance mechanisms within the MPC framework.
	4.	Simulate various dynamic scenarios (e.g., moving obstacles, changing goal points) to test the robotâ€™s adaptability and efficiency.

ðŸŸ¦ Eï¼ˆExpectationï¼‰

The robot should be able to navigate smoothly and efficiently, adapt to environmental changes in real time, and avoid obstaclesâ€”demonstrating the advantages of MPC over traditional control approaches in dynamic motion planning tasks.

**Implementation:**

1. Model the robotâ€™s motion dynamics in Python:

```python
class Robot:
    def __init__(self, mass, inertia, max_acceleration, max_velocity):
        self.mass = mass
        self.inertia = inertia
        self.max_acceleration = max_acceleration
        self.max_velocity = max_velocity
        self.position = [0, 0]
        self.velocity = [0, 0]
        self.orientation = 0
        self.angular_velocity = 0

    def update(self, acceleration, angular_acceleration, dt):
        self.velocity[0] += self.angular_velocity * dt
        self.velocity[1] -= self.angular_velocity * dt
        self.velocity[0] += acceleration[0] * dt
        self.velocity[1] += acceleration[1] * dt
        self.position[0] += self.velocity[0] * dt
        self.position[1] += self.velocity[1] * dt
        self.orientation += self.angular_velocity * dt
```

2. Implement a model predictive control (MPC) algorithm:

```python
import numpy as np

def mpc(robot, horizon, dt, goal, obstacles, speed_limit, turning_radius):
    # Predict the robot's future state based on the current state and control inputs
    x = np.array([robot.position, robot.velocity, robot.orientation])
    u = np.zeros((horizon, 2))
    S = np.zeros((horizon, 6))

    for i in range(horizon):
        a = u[i, :]
        theta = robot.orientation + i * dt * robot.angular_velocity
        x_dot = np.array([robot.velocity, robot.velocity + a * dt, robot.angular_velocity])
        x_dot_dot = np.array([a, robot.max_acceleration
