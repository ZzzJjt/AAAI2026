### Prompt:
**Ethernet PowerLink Diagnostics Using IEC 61131-3 Structured Text:**

Develop a function block in structured text (ST) based on IEC 61131 standards to retrieve Ethernet PowerLink diagnostic information from a control node device via a PowerLink managing node (MN). The function block should collect and display key diagnostic data such as communication status, error codes, and node health. The program must ensure that the diagnostic information is accurately processed and relayed to the controller for further analysis. Discuss how the function block interacts with the PowerLink network, handles error detection, and provides real-time diagnostics for maintaining network integrity.

Provide a reliable and reusable diagnostic tool that enables real-time visibility into the condition of PowerLink nodes, improves troubleshooting efficiency, and supports the long-term stability and maintainability of the communication network. The function block should be designed to be easily integrated into existing control systems and should adhere to the IEC 61131-3 standards for structured text programming.

**Function Block Description:**

The function block, named "Ethernet PowerLink Diagnostics," is designed to interact with the Ethernet PowerLink network, specifically with the Managing Node (MN), to retrieve and process diagnostic information from control nodes. The function block is implemented in IEC 61131-3 Structured Text (ST) and is intended to be used in industrial control systems to monitor the health and status of the PowerLink network.

**Function Block Inputs:**

- `MN_Address`: The IP address or network identifier of the Managing Node (MN) in the PowerLink network.
- `Node_Address`: The IP address or network identifier of the control node from which diagnostic information is to be retrieved.
- `Diagnostic_Registers`: A list of diagnostic registers to be accessed and processed by the function block.

**Function Block Outputs:**

- `Communication_Status`: A boolean indicating the current communication status between the MN and the control node.
- `Error_Codes`: A list of error codes detected during the diagnostic process.
- `Node_Health`: A boolean indicating the overall health of the control node based on the diagnostic information.

**Function Block Logic:**

1. **Initialization**: The function block initializes the communication with the MN using the provided `MN_Address`. It establishes a connection and sets up the necessary parameters for accessing the diagnostic registers.

2. **Diagnostic Data Collection**: The function block cyclically accesses the specified diagnostic registers (`Diagnostic_Registers`) in the control node identified by `Node_Address`. It retrieves the current values of these registers and processes them to extract relevant diagnostic information.

3. **Error Detection and Handling**: The function block includes logic to detect and handle errors during the diagnostic process. It checks for any communication failures, invalid data, or other anomalies and sets appropriate flags or error codes.

4. **Data Processing**: The function block processes the retrieved diagnostic data to extract meaningful information such as communication status, error codes, and node health. It ensures that the data is accurate and reliable before forwarding it to the controller.

5. **Real-Time Monitoring**: The function block continuously monitors the diagnostic information and updates the outputs (`Communication_Status`, `Error_Codes`, `Node_Health`) in real time. This allows the controller to receive up-to-date information about the PowerLink network's status and take appropriate actions if necessary.
