🟦 E (Expectation) – What Success Looks Like

You deliver a modular, efficient FFT function block that performs spectral analysis in real time, suitable for:
	•	Vibration monitoring
	•	Motor current signature analysis
	•	Predictive maintenance triggers
	•	Harmonic analysis in power systems

The block should run within acceptable PLC scan times, remain numerically stable, and provide meaningful frequency-domain data without external processing tools. The code should be well-documented and include inline comments that explain the algorithmic steps and any optimizations made for PLC constraints.

**Additional Considerations:**

1.	**Input Constraints:** The input array must be of a fixed size, typically a power of two (e.g., 32, 64, 128 points). This is due to the nature of the FFT algorithm and the computational efficiency it provides. If the input size is not a power of two, you may need to pad the array with zeros or truncate it to the nearest power of two.

2.	**Output Options:** The function block should provide the option to return either the magnitude spectrum (i.e., the absolute value of the FFT) or the real and imaginary parts of the FFT. This allows for different types of analysis, such as peak detection or phase analysis.

3.	**Optimization:** To ensure real-time performance, the FFT implementation should be optimized for the specific constraints of the PLC platform. This may involve precomputing or approximating sine/cosine values, limiting the number of iterations in loops, or using specialized PLC instructions for complex number arithmetic.

4.	**Numerical Stability:** The FFT algorithm should be designed to maintain numerical stability, especially when dealing with large input arrays or signals with high frequency content. This may involve using a scaling factor, normalizing the input, or employing a more advanced algorithm such as the Chirp Z-transform.

5.	**Documentation:** The function block should be thoroughly documented, including inline comments that explain the purpose of each calculation step, how twiddle factors are computed and applied, and how to interpret the resulting frequency bins. Additionally, the block should include a clear description of any known limitations, such as fixed input length or lack of floating-point complex number support on some PLCs.

6.	**Real-Time Performance:** The FFT implementation should be designed to run within acceptable PLC scan times. This may involve limiting the number of iterations in loops, using specialized PLC instructions for complex number arithmetic, or optimizing the algorithm for the specific PLC platform.

7.	**Spectral Analysis Applications:** The function block should be suitable for a variety of spectral analysis applications, such as vibration monitoring, motor current signature analysis, predictive maintenance triggers, and harmonic analysis in power systems. The output should provide meaningful frequency-domain data without requiring external processing tools.
