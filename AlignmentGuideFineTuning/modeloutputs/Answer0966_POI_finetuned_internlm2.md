🟩 A (Action)
	•	Implement a discrete-time, 2-state Kalman filter using only scalar arithmetic, avoiding matrix operations or recursion
	•	Accept configurable inputs:
	•	MeasuredPosition : REAL
	•	Q : REAL – process noise covariance
	•	R : REAL – measurement noise covariance
	•	DeltaT : REAL – sample time
	•	Reset : BOOL – to reinitialize state
	•	Internally manage variables for:
	•	Estimated position and velocity
	•	Previous position (for velocity update)
	•	Error covariance and Kalman gain
	•	Perform prediction and update steps each scan cycle
	•	Add clear comments for each stage of the algorithm to support maintainability and clarity

⸻

🟦 G (Goal)

Deliver a modular, scan-cycle-safe function block that produces reliable estimates of position and velocity despite measurement noise. The block should be easy to configure, integrate into motion control logic, and adaptable for various autonomous or mobile platform applications.
