**Control Narrative for Ethanol Production**

**Section 3: Fermentation**

**3.1 Temperature Control**

The fermentation process requires precise temperature control to ensure optimal yeast activity and product quality. The target temperature range is 32â€“35â€¯Â°C. A PID controller will be used to maintain the temperature within this range. The temperature sensor will be located in the fermentation vessel, and the controller will adjust the cooling or heating system as needed. If the temperature exceeds the upper limit, an alarm will be triggered, and the cooling system will be activated. If the temperature falls below the lower limit, an alarm will be triggered, and the heating system will be activated. The control system will also have a safety interlock to prevent the cooling or heating system from being activated simultaneously.

**3.2 pH Regulation**

The pH of the fermentation broth must be maintained within a specific range to ensure optimal yeast activity and product quality. The target pH range is 4.5â€“5.0. A pH sensor will be located in the fermentation vessel, and a PID controller will be used to maintain the pH within this range. The controller will adjust the addition of acid or base as needed. If the pH exceeds the upper limit, an alarm will be triggered, and the acid addition system will be activated. If the pH falls below the lower limit, an alarm will be triggered, and the base addition system will be activated. The control system will also have a safety interlock to prevent the acid or base addition system from being activated simultaneously.

**3.3 Inoculation**

The inoculation process involves adding yeast to the fermentation broth to initiate the fermentation process. The control system will monitor the yeast concentration and adjust the inoculation rate as needed to ensure optimal yeast activity. The control system will also have a safety interlock to prevent the inoculation system from being activated if the yeast concentration is too low or if the fermentation vessel is not properly prepared.

**3.4 Safety Interlocks and Alarms**

The control system will have multiple safety interlocks and alarms to ensure the safe operation of the fermentation process. These include:

* Temperature and pH alarms to trigger cooling or heating systems and acid or base addition systems
* Inoculation alarms to prevent the inoculation system from being activated if the yeast concentration is too low or if the fermentation
