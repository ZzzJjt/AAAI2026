### Intent:
**Intent Summary:**  
Develop an OPC UA client in C, encapsulate it as an IEC 61131-3 function block (ST) with Execute/Timeout inputs and status/error outputs, enabling PLCs to securely connect to OPC UA servers with managed communication and error handling.  

*(Focus: Bridging C-based OPC UA functionality to PLC logic via standardized FB interface.)*

### Prompt:
**OPC UA Client Implementation Using C and IEC 61131-3 Structured Text:**

Develop C-code for an OPC UA client, then wrap it into an IEC 61131-based function block written in structured text (ST). The function block should have the following input pins: Execute (type: BOOL), ServerUrl (type: STRING[255]), and Timeout (type: TIME). The output pins should include Done (type: BOOL), Busy (type: BOOL), Error (type: BOOL), and ErrorID (type: DWORD). In your explanation, describe how the C-code interfaces with the OPC UA server, how the function block manages communication with the server, and how error handling is implemented. Provide details on how to integrate this function block within an IEC 61131-3 environment for reliable client-server communication.

**C-A-R-E:**

ðŸŸ¥ C (Context) â€“ The Background

OPC UA is a widely adopted communication standard for industrial automation, offering secure, platform-independent connectivity between devices and control systems. However, many PLC environments lack built-in OPC UA client functionality, requiring custom integration using external C libraries and Structured Text (ST) to bridge the communication between the PLC and the OPC UA server.

â¸»

ðŸŸ© A (Action) â€“ The Implementation Task

Develop a C-based OPC UA client using a standard library (e.g., open62541) to manage connections, requests, and responses with an OPC UA server. Wrap this client logic into a callable module and expose it to an IEC 61131-3 environment as a Structured Text function block. The function block should include:

Inputs:
	â€¢	Execute (BOOL) â€“ Triggers the connection process
	â€¢	ServerUrl (STRING[255]) â€“ Specifies the target OPC UA server
	â€¢	Timeout (TIME) â€“ Defines the allowable wait period for connection

Outputs:
	â€¢	Done (BOOL) â€“ Indicates successful execution
	â€¢	Busy (BOOL) â€“ Signals ongoing communication
	â€¢	Error (BOOL) â€“ Flags any failure during execution
	â€¢	ErrorID (DWORD) â€“ Returns the relevant error code

The function block must manage internal communication state, map C return values to PLC-readable flags, and provide predictable results for integration into deterministic control logic.

â¸»

ðŸŸ¨ R (Result) â€“ The Expected Outcome

The resulting solution enables a PLC program to reliably initiate and manage OPC UA client connections, with built-in execution control and error handling. It provides clear status feedback to the automation engineer, allowing seamless integration into broader machine or process workflows that rely on real-time data exchange over OPC UA.

â¸»

ðŸŸ¦ E (Example) â€“ A Practical Use Case

For example, in a production line application, the ST program sets Execute := TRUE to start a connection to the OPC UA server at opc.tcp://192.168.1.100:4840. The C client handles the session creation. If successful, Done := TRUE is set and process variables are exchanged. If the server is unavailable or times out, Error := TRUE and ErrorID := 0x02 (e.g., timeout) are returned, enabling the PLC to trigger a retry or alarm without freezing execution.

**C-A-R-E:**

ðŸŸ¥ C (Context) â€“ The Background

OPC UA is a widely used communication protocol in industrial automation, enabling secure, standardized, and platform-independent communication between devices and control systems. However, many PLC environments lack native OPC UA client functionality, requiring developers to implement C-code interfaces to OPC UA servers using standard libraries such as Open62541. Integrating this C-code into an IEC 61131-3 environmentâ€”where Structured Text (ST) is the primary programming languageâ€”presents a challenge due to the lack of native C support in typical PLCs. To address this, a C-based OPC UA client must be wrapped into a self-contained function block written in ST, which will then be executed within the PLC environment.

â¸»

ðŸŸ© A (Action) â€“ The Implementation Task

Develop a C-based OPC UA client using the Open62541 library to establish connections, handle requests, and manage responses with an OPC UA server. Then, wrap this C-code functionality into a self-contained function block written in IEC 61131-3 Structured Text. The function block should expose the following inputs and outputs:

Inputs:
	â€¢	Execute (type: BOOL) â€“ A trigger to initiate the connection process
	â€¢	ServerUrl (type: STRING[255]) â€“ The OPC UA serverâ€™s network address
	â€¢	Timeout (type: TIME) â€“ The maximum time allowed for the server connection

Outputs:
	â€¢	Done (type: BOOL) â€“ A flag indicating whether the connection was successful
	â€¢	Busy (type: BOOL) â€“ A flag indicating whether the server connection is currently active
	â€¢	Error (type: BOOL) â€“ A flag indicating whether an error occurred during the connection process
	â€¢	ErrorID (type: DWORD) â€“ An error code if an error occurred

The C-code should manage the connection lifecycle, error handling, and communication with the server. The function block should map C error codes to PLC-readable error flags and provide status outputs to guide the PLCâ€™s control logic. Additionally, the function block must ensure that the C-code is wrapped in a self-contained environment, with all necessary includes and function calls properly managed, to ensure compatibility with the PLCâ€™s Struct
