### Intent:
**Intent Summary:**  
Develop an IEC 61131-3 Structured Text program for cascade control in an oil refinery, where an outer pressure loop adjusts the setpoint of an inner flow loop to stabilize vessel pressure and improve disturbance rejection.  

*(Key focus: Coordinated dual-loop control, pressure-flow hierarchy, PLC implementation.)*

### Prompt:
**Cascade Control Oil Refinery:**

Develop a self-contained IEC 61131-3 Structured Text program (not a function block) to implement cascade control for pressure regulation in an oil refinery vessel. The primary loop should control the vessel pressure, adjusting the pressure setpoint based on the process requirements. The secondary loop controls the flow of oil into the vessel, with the output of the primary loop serving as the setpoint for the secondary loop.

Ensure that the program manages the interaction between the two control loops, allowing the inner loop (oil flow control) to respond rapidly to changes in flow while the outer loop (pressure control) maintains overall process stability. Include typical parameter values for pressure and flow control, and discuss the benefits of cascade control in oil refinery operations, particularly for improving response time and process stability in systems with large disturbances.

**T-A-G:**

🟥 T (Task) – What You Need to Do

Create a self-contained IEC 61131-3 Structured Text program (not a function block) to implement cascade control for pressure regulation in an oil refinery vessel. The system should coordinate two control loops to maintain stable operation under varying conditions.

⸻

🟩 A (Action) – How to Do It
	1.	Design the Outer Loop (Primary Control – Pressure):
	•	Compare the vessel pressure setpoint (Pressure_SP := 12.0) with the measured pressure (Pressure_PV).
	•	Calculate the pressure error and use a proportional controller (Kp_Outer := 1.2) to generate a flow rate setpoint (Flow_SP).
	2.	Design the Inner Loop (Secondary Control – Flow):
	•	Compare the generated Flow_SP with the actual oil inflow rate (Flow_PV).
	•	Calculate the flow error and apply proportional control (Kp_Inner := 2.5) to produce an output signal (Flow_Output) that adjusts the flow actuator (e.g., valve or pump).
	3.	Program Structure:
	•	Ensure inner loop executes faster and more frequently than the outer loop.
	•	Maintain clarity with commented, modular logic for easy tuning and scalability.

⸻

🟦 G (Goal) – What You Want to Achieve

The final control system should:
	•	Provide fast response to oil inflow disturbances via the inner loop
	•	Maintain stable vessel pressure through coordinated outer-loop control
	•	Be PLC-ready, maintainable, and serve as a reusable template for other cascade control applications in refinery systems
	•	Demonstrate the efficiency and stability improvements cascade control offers over single-loop methods

    // Outer loop: pressure control
    Pressure_SP : REAL := 12.0;
    Pressure_PV : REAL;
    Pressure_Error : REAL;
    Flow_SP : REAL;

    // Inner loop: flow control
    Flow_PV : REAL;
    Flow_Error : REAL;
    Flow_Output : REAL;

    // Gains
    Kp_Outer : REAL := 1.2;
    Kp_Inner : REAL := 2.5;
END_VAR

// Outer loop: pressure regulation

Flow_SP := Kp_Outer * Pressure_Error;

// Inner loop: flow regulation
Flow_Error := Flow_SP - Flow_PV;
Flow_Output := Kp_Inner * Flow_Error;

// Flow_Output controls the oil inlet valve

💡 Additional Information

* Cascade control is a popular method for improving the performance of control systems in oil refineries and other process industries.
* By separating the control of fast-changing variables (e.g., flow) from slow-changing variables (e.g., pressure), cascade control allows for faster response times and better disturbance rejection.
* The outer loop (pressure control) maintains overall stability, while the inner loop (flow control) responds quickly to changes in the process.
* The gains for the proportional controllers can be adjusted to optimize the performance of the cascade control system.
* Anti-reset windup and dead-band can be implemented to further improve the stability and performance of the control system.
* The Structured Text program provided is a basic example and can be expanded or modified to suit specific application requirements.
* The program can be easily integrated into a PLC for real-time control of oil refinery processes.
* Cascade control can be applied to other process variables, such as temperature, level, and composition, to improve the overall performance of control systems in oil refineries and other process industries.
