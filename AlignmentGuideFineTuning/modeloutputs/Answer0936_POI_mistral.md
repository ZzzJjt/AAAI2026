ðŸŸ¥ T (Task) â€“ What You Need to Do

Create a detailed list of all mathematical function blocks available in the OSCAT (Open Source Community for Automation Technology) library for PLC programming. The list should include a clear description of each blockâ€™s functionality and typical use cases in industrial control.

â¸»

ðŸŸ© A (Action) â€“ How You Should Do It

To complete this task:
	1.	Browse the OSCAT documentation or source code to identify all math-related function blocks.
	2.	For each function block, include:
	â€¢	Function block name (e.g., SIN, MEAN_ARRAY)
	â€¢	A brief functional description
	â€¢	Typical use case (e.g., waveform generation, process data smoothing, quality control)
	3.	Categorize the blocks for readability, such as:
	â€¢	Trigonometric Functions
	â€¢	Algebraic Operations
	â€¢	Statistical Calculations
	â€¢	Exponential/Logarithmic Functions
	â€¢	Array and Data Processing
	4.	Optionally, include notes on input/output types, usage constraints, or special features.
