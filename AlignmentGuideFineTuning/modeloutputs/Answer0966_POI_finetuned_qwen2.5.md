ðŸŸ¦ G (Goal)

Deliver a modular, scan-cycle-safe function block that produces reliable estimates of position and velocity despite measurement noise. The block should be easy to configure, integrate into motion control logic, and adaptable for various autonomous or mobile platform applications. Ensure that the implementation is self-contained, with all required variables and logic encapsulated within the function block, and that it is designed to handle real-time constraints and scan-cycle safety.

**B-A-B:**

Before

You are working on a motion control system for an autonomous transport vehicle, where precise estimation of position and velocity is critical for navigation and obstacle avoidance. However, the sensors used in the system are noisy, and without a proper filtering mechanism, the control decisions can be unreliable.

After

You have implemented a self-contained Kalman filter function block in IEC 61131-3 Structured Text that processes noisy sensor data to provide accurate estimates of the vehicleâ€™s position and velocity. The function block is designed to be scan-cycle-safe, with configurable parameters for noise covariance and initial conditions, ensuring that it can be integrated into real-time motion control applications with deterministic performance.

Result

The autonomous transport vehicleâ€™s motion control system now benefits from more accurate and stable position and velocity estimates, improving overall navigation performance and safety. The Kalman filter function block is reusable and can be applied to other systems requiring real-time state estimation under noisy conditions.
