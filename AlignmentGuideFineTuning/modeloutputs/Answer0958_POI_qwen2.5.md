### Intent:
**Intent Summary:**  
Develop an IEC 61131-3 Structured Text program to safely and sequentially shut down a steel production facility, including controlled furnace temperature reduction, fuel gas flow ramp-down over 12 hours, and dynamic oxygen supply adjustment to maintain a 1:2.5 fuel-to-air ratio, with embedded safety checks and modular functions.

### Prompt:
**Shutdown Steel Production:**

Develop a comprehensive list of steps for the controlled shutdown of a steel production facility. Include key stages such as reducing furnace temperature, controlling gas flow rates, and maintaining safe oxygen levels throughout the shutdown process.

Provide a detailed control narrative for steps 4 to 6 of the shutdown sequence, specifying concrete ranges and setpoints for variables such as temperature, gas flow, and oxygen levels.

Write a self-contained IEC 61131-3 Structured Text program based on this control narrative, ensuring proper sequencing and safety protocols.

Additionally, create a function in IEC 61131-3 to gradually reduce the fuel gas flow rate to the furnace burners over a period of 12 hours. This function should incorporate timing and safety checks to ensure smooth transitions.

Lastly, write an IEC 61131-3 function for adjusting the oxygen supply to the burners to maintain a precise fuel-to-air ratio of 1:2.5 during the shutdown. Ensure the function is adaptable to fluctuations in gas flow and temperature, and include safeguards for maintaining combustion efficiency.

**Control Narrative for Steps 4 to 6:**

**Step 4: Furnace Temperature Reduction**
- **Objective:** Cool the furnace to a safe temperature below 400Â°C.
- **Control Strategy:** Gradually reduce the fuel gas flow and adjust the oxygen supply to maintain a stable combustion process while cooling the furnace.
- **Setpoints and Ranges:**
  - Furnace Temperature: < 400Â°C
  - Fuel Gas Flow: Gradually decrease from current level to 0 over 12 hours
  - Oxygen Supply: Adjust to maintain a 1:2.5 fuel-to-air ratio

**Step 5: Fuel Gas Flow Ramp-Down**
- **Objective:** Reduce the fuel gas flow to the furnace burners over 12 hours.
- **Control Strategy:** Implement a linear ramp-down function to reduce the fuel gas flow rate.
- **Setpoints and Ranges:**
  - Fuel Gas Flow: Decrease from current level to 0 over 12 hours
  - Timing: 12 hours
  - Safety Checks: Ensure no sudden drops in gas flow that could cause combustion instability

**Step 6: Oxygen Supply Adjustment**
- **Objective:** Maintain a 1:2.5 fuel-to-air ratio during the shutdown process.
- **Control Strategy:** Adjust the oxygen supply based on the current fuel gas flow and furnace temperature to maintain the desired ratio.
- **Setpoints and Ranges:**
  - Fuel Gas Flow: Current level
  - Furnace Temperature: Current temperature
  - Oxygen Supply: Adjust to maintain a 1:2.5 fuel-to-air ratio
  - Safety Checks: Ensure the oxygen supply does not exceed safe limits and maintain combustion efficiency
