### Intent:
**Intent Summary:**  
Create an IEC 61131-3 Structured Text function block to compute eigenvalues of a 10√ó10 real matrix using power iteration with deflation, optimized for PLC constraints (fixed iterations, no recursion) and including error handling for industrial real-time applications.  

*(Focus: Eigenvalue computation for control/monitoring tasks, emphasizing PLC compatibility and deterministic behavior.)*

### Prompt:
**Fast Fourier Transform:**

Develop a self-contained function block in IEC 61131-3 Structured Text to compute the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) of a given input array. Ensure that the implementation is efficient and includes detailed comments explaining the algorithmic steps involved in computing the FFT. Discuss any limitations in terms of computational complexity and real-time performance, as well as considerations for handling input size constraints typically found in industrial control systems.

**B-A-B:**

üü• B (Before) ‚Äì The Challenge

Performing frequency-domain analysis on signal data is essential for applications such as vibration monitoring, motor diagnostics, and predictive maintenance. However, PLC platforms typically lack built-in support for Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) operations due to limited processing power, real-time cycle constraints, and memory limitations. Without an optimized implementation, FFT can be too slow or unstable for use in live industrial environments.

üü© A (After) ‚Äì The Ideal Outcome

Design a self-contained IEC 61131-3 Structured Text function block named FFT_Block that:
	‚Ä¢	Accepts a REAL input array (e.g., InputSignal: ARRAY[1..N] OF REAL)
	‚Ä¢	Computes its Fast Fourier Transform, returning an array of complex magnitudes (or amplitude + phase)
	‚Ä¢	Implements an efficient FFT algorithm (e.g., radix-2 Cooley-Tukey), ideally using a power-of-two input length
	‚Ä¢	Is clearly documented, with inline comments explaining each key algorithm step such as:
	‚Ä¢	Bit-reversal reordering
	‚Ä¢	Butterfly computation
	‚Ä¢	Real/imaginary separation
	‚Ä¢	Includes parameters for windowing, normalization, or fixed input length where applicable

Also provide a brief discussion of:
	‚Ä¢	PLC-specific challenges such as numerical precision, array length limits, and cycle time constraints
	‚Ä¢	Trade-offs between accuracy and speed in real-time scenarios
	‚Ä¢	Recommended use cases, such as frequency fault detection, waveform analysis, or predictive maintenance triggers

üüß B (Bridge) ‚Äì The Implementation Strategy

To implement this FFT function block:
	1.	Define input/output arrays and necessary internal variables (e.g., twiddle factors, index mapping).
	2.	Limit input size to a manageable, fixed length (e.g., 64 or 128 points) to ensure compatibility with PLC resources.
	3.	Precompute constants if possible to reduce real-time load.
	4.	Use a modular approach so the function block can be reused and integrated with HMI, data logging, or alarm systems.
	5.	Document limitations such as:
	‚Ä¢	‚ÄúThis block assumes a fixed power-of-two input length‚Äù
	‚Ä¢	‚ÄúDesigned for low-frequency, low-sample-rate industrial diagnostics‚Äù

This structure enables FFT computation directly on the PLC, making spectral analysis accessible for real-time condition monitoring without external hardware.
