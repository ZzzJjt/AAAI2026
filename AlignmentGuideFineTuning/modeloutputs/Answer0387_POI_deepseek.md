### Intent:
**Intent Summary:**  
Create a text-based Piping and Instrumentation Diagram (P&ID) for a power plant steam-water cycle, detailing equipment, instrumentation, control loops with tag names, and piping flow paths in structured textual notation for design, documentation, and automation integration.  

**Code Generation Intent:**  
Generate a textual P&ID representation of a steam-water cycle with tagged instruments, control loops, and piping logic for non-graphical environments.

### Prompt:
**P-ID Steam Water Cycle:**

Create a P&I diagram in textual notation for a steam water cycle in a power plant. Include equipment, instrumentation, piping, and control loops. Provide concrete tag names.

**C-A-R-E:**

🟥 C (Context) – Background Situation

In power plant engineering, the steam-water cycle is a critical process that involves feedwater supply, steam generation, energy transfer, and condensate recovery. Typically, this system is documented using graphical Piping and Instrumentation Diagrams (P&IDs). However, in environments where visual tools aren’t available—such as early-stage design, textual documentation, or version-controlled environments—engineers often rely on structured textual notation to convey the same information effectively.

⸻

🟩 A (Action) – Task to Perform

Create a text-based P&ID for a steam-water cycle that includes:
	•	Process equipment (e.g., boiler, steam drum, feedwater pump, condenser)
	•	Instrumentation (e.g., pressure transmitters, level controllers, flow elements)
	•	Control loops with concrete tag names (e.g., FT101, FCV102, LT103)
	•	Piping flow paths clearly represented using arrows (-->) and structured indentation

Ensure the layout clearly communicates the relationship between instruments, control logic, and equipment within the system.

⸻

🟨 R (Result) – Expected Outcome

The result will be a readable, logically sequenced P&ID in textual format, suitable for:
	•	Early-stage design discussions
	•	Control narrative development
	•	Integration with PLC or DCS logic
	•	Documenting control loop structure for cross-disciplinary teams

It will serve as a bridge between process design and automation, even in environments where graphical diagrams are not practical.

	•	Pressure Transmitter LT102
	•	Level Indicator LIC102

Control loops are represented by tag names:
	•	FT101 (Feedwater Flow)
	•	FCV101 (Condenser Flow)
	•	LT102 (Steam Drum Pressure)

The piping flow paths are represented by arrows and structured indentation.

🟪 E (Exception) – Potential Issues

The main challenge in creating a text-based P&ID is maintaining a clear, concise, and accurate representation of the system. To overcome this, ensure that the P&ID is well-structured, easy to read, and accurately reflects the system's logic.

Additionally, the P&ID should be reviewed and validated by subject matter experts to ensure its accuracy and completeness.

⸻

🟩 A (Action) – Solution

To address these issues, follow these guidelines:
	•	Use clear, concise language to describe equipment, instrumentation, and control loops.
	•	Structure the P&ID logically, with clear indentation and flow paths.
	•	Include tag names for each control loop, making them easily searchable and understandable.
	•	Ensure the P&ID is reviewed and validated by subject matter experts.

By following these steps, you can create a text-based P&ID that effectively communicates the steam-water cycle's logic and structure.
