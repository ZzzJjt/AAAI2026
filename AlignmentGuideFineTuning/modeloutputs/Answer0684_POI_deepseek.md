### Intent:
The task is to create an ASCII art Function Block Diagram (FBD) showing a basic control loop with an analog input feeding both a timer and PID block, where only the PID output drives an analog output, including labeled signal names for each block. 

Intent: Generate a text-based IEC 61131-3 FBD representation of a PID control loop with signal flow visualization.

### Prompt:
**FBD PID:**

Create a 61131-3 function block diagram in ASCII art. It shall contain an analog input, a timer block, and a PID block as well as an analog output. The analog input feeds both the timer and the PID block. Only the PID block is connected to the analog output. Provide typical input and output signals for each function block and show them inside each block.

**R-I-S-E:**

🟥 R (Role) – Define Your Role

Act as a PLC programmer or automation engineer tasked with documenting a basic control loop using IEC 61131-3 Function Block Diagram (FBD) concepts in ASCII format for system documentation or collaboration in text-based environments.

🟩 I (Input) – Information Provided

You need to create an ASCII art diagram representing a simple control structure that includes:
	•	An Analog Input block
	•	A TON (Timer On Delay) block
	•	A PID control block
	•	An Analog Output block

The logic flow should follow these rules:
	•	The Analog Input feeds both the Timer and the PID block
	•	Only the PID output (CV) is connected to the Analog Output input (IN)
	•	Each block must show typical signal names, like IN, OUT, ET, PV, SP, CV

⸻

🟧 S (Steps) – Steps to Perform
	1.	Create ASCII block shapes (e.g., using +-----+) to represent each function block.
	2.	Place signal names inside each block:
	•	For AnalogInput: OUT = AI
	•	For TON: IN = AI, ET = ET, Q = Q
	•	For PID: PV = AI, SP = 50.0, CV = CV
	•	For AnalogOutput: IN = CV
	3.	Connect the blocks using arrows (-->) to show signal flow:
	•	AI → TON and PID
	•	CV → Analog Output
	4.	Keep the layout clean, aligned, and readable for quick understanding in plain-text tools.

⸻

🟦 E (Expectation) – Expected Outcome

The result should be a functional, clearly labeled ASCII-based FBD diagram that can be used in technical documentation, version-controlled code repositories, or design review notes. It allows stakeholders to understand the signal flow, block behavior, and interface structure even without graphical tools.
