### Intent:
**Intent Summary:**  
Develop an IEC 61131-3 Structured Text function block to monitor and diagnose Ethernet PowerLink network nodes by retrieving real-time communication status, error codes, and health data via a managing node, ensuring fault detection and system reliability.  

*(Focus: ST-based diagnostics, PowerLink MN interaction, cyclic updates, error handling.)*

### Prompt:
**Ethernet PowerLink Diagnostics Using IEC 61131-3 Structured Text:**

Develop a function block in structured text (ST) based on IEC 61131 standards to retrieve Ethernet PowerLink diagnostic information from a control node device via a PowerLink managing node (MN). The function block should collect and display key diagnostic data such as communication status, error codes, and node health. The program must ensure that the diagnostic information is accurately processed and relayed to the controller for further analysis. Discuss how the function block interacts with the PowerLink network, handles error detection, and provides real-time diagnostics for maintaining network integrity.

**R-I-S-E:**

ðŸŸ¥ R (Role) â€“ Your Role

Act as an industrial automation engineer developing diagnostics and communication monitoring tools using IEC 61131-3 Structured Text for Ethernet PowerLink networks.

ðŸŸ© I (Input) â€“ What Youâ€™re Given

You are tasked with building a function block in Structured Text (ST) that retrieves diagnostic information from a PowerLink control node via a PowerLink Managing Node (MN). The diagnostic data must include communication status, error codes, and node health. The data should be processed and passed to the controller for analysis and real-time monitoring. The solution must handle error detection and support cyclic updates.

ðŸŸ§ S (Steps) â€“ What to Do

	1.	Design a function block interface with inputs for node identifiers and communication triggers, and outputs for status, error codes, and health indicators.
 
	2.	Implement cyclic polling logic that queries the MN for diagnostic information related to connected control nodes.
 
	3.	Parse and validate the returned diagnostic data, handling potential communication errors or missing responses.
 
	4.	Output structured diagnostic results to the controller or HMI, and ensure any critical errors are flagged appropriately for operator awareness.

ðŸŸ¦ E (Expectation) â€“ What Success Looks Like

The function block should provide accurate, real-time insight into the health of each PowerLink node. It should detect and report faults immediately, support maintenance decisions, and ensure that communication issues are logged and traceableâ€”enhancing system reliability and reducing troubleshooting time.

**Function Block Design:**

1.	**Inputs:**
	* NodeID (integer): Identifies the specific PowerLink control node to be monitored.
	* PollingInterval (time): Defines the frequency at which the function block queries the MN for diagnostic information.
	* Enable (boolean): Enables or disables the function block's operation.

2.	**Outputs:**
	* Status (boolean): Indicates whether the monitored node is currently communicating with the MN.
	* ErrorCode (integer): Represents any error codes detected during communication with the MN.
	* Health (integer): Provides a health indicator for the monitored node, with values ranging from 0 (critical) to 100 (optimal).

3.	**Variables:**
	* LastCommunicationTime (time): Stores the timestamp of the last successful communication with the MN.
	* LastErrorCode (integer): Stores the error code returned during the last communication with the MN.

4.	**Function Block Body:**

```
PROGRAM EthernetPowerLinkDiagnostics

VAR
	CommunicationStatus, Health: BOOL;
	ErrorCode: INT;
	LastCommunicationTime, PollingInterval: TIME;
	NodeID: INT;
	Enable: BOOL;

IF Enable THEN
	IF T_now - LastCommunicationTime >= PollingInterval THEN
		// Query the MN for diagnostic information
		CommunicationStatus := QueryPowerLinkMN(NodeID);

		// Parse and validate the returned diagnostic data
		IF CommunicationStatus THEN
			Health := CalculateNodeHealth(ErrorCode);
			Status := TRUE;
		ELSE
			Status := FALSE;
			ErrorCode := GetLastErrorCode();
			Health := CalculateNodeHealth(ErrorCode);
		END_IF

		// Update the function block variables
		LastCommunicationTime := T_now;
		LastErrorCode := ErrorCode;
	END_IF
END_IF

// Output the diagnostic results to the controller or HMI
OUT Status;
OUT ErrorCode;
OUT Health;
