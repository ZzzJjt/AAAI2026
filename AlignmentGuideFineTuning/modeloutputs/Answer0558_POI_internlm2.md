	â€¢	Temp_SP: The temperature setpoint (e.g., 950Â°C)
	â€¢	PID gains:
	â€¢	Proportional: Kp := 3.0

ðŸŸ§ S (Steps) â€“ What You Need to Do
	1.	Calculate the error between the setpoint and measured temperature:
Error := Temp_SP - Temp_PV
	2.	Accumulate the integral term based on the error and cycle time:
Integral := Integral + Error * 0.1
	3.	Calculate the derivative using the difference between the current and previous error:
Derivative := (Error - Prev_Error) / 0.1
	4.	Compute the PID output to determine valve position:
Valve_Position := (Kp * Error) + (Ki * Integral) + (Kd * Derivative)
	5.	Clamp the valve output to stay within the defined operational limits
	6.	Store the current error in Prev_Error for the next cycle

ðŸŸ¦ E (Expectation) â€“ What Success Looks Like

The PID program should:
	â€¢	Maintain the turbine temperature precisely at the target setpoint
	â€¢	Respond quickly to load changes, fuel variability, and thermal disturbances
	â€¢	Prevent overheating or undershooting by clamping valve actuation
	â€¢	Be deployable on industrial PLCs and suitable for high-reliability control environments in energy systems

1.	Consider the impact of hysteresis on the PID control loop. Adding hysteresis can help prevent oscillations and improve stability.
2.	Ensure that the PID controller is properly tuned for the specific gas turbine system. The given gains are a starting point and may need to be adjusted based on the system's response characteristics.
3.	Implement proper error handling and fault detection to ensure safe operation in case of sensor failures or other abnormal conditions.
4.	Consider using a digital filter to reduce noise and improve the accuracy of the temperature measurement.
5.	Incorporate a deadband around the setpoint to prevent unnecessary valve actuation and improve control performance.
6.	Use a high-performance PLC with fast response times and accurate analog inputs to ensure precise control of the gas turbine temperature.

ðŸŸ¢ C (Challenges)

1.	**System Dynamics:** Gas turbines are complex systems with multiple interacting components, making it challenging to accurately model their behavior and dynamics. Proper tuning of the PID controller requires a deep understanding of the system's response characteristics and the impact of different control parameters.
2.	**Response Time:** Fast response times are crucial for maintaining stable operation and preventing damage to the gas turbine. However, achieving fast response times while ensuring stability can be a delicate balance, especially under varying load conditions.
3.**Maintaining Stability:** Gas turbines are subjected to a wide range of operating conditions, including load changes, fuel variability, and thermal disturbances. Ensuring stable operation under these varying conditions requires careful tuning of the PID controller and proper implementation of control strategies.
4.	**Sensor Accuracy:** Accurate temperature measurements are essential for effective PID control. Ensuring the reliability and accuracy of temperature sensors can be challenging, especially in harsh environments within the gas turbine.
5.	**Valve Actuation:** The valve controlling the inlet airflow must be actuated precisely to maintain the desired temperature. Ensuring reliable
