### Intent:
The task is to create a text-based Process Flow Diagram (PFD) for penicillin fermentation, detailing process units, instrumentation, flow directions, and control logic (e.g., PID loops) to support automation design and process control implementation.  

**Intent Summary:**  
*Generate a structured textual PFD for penicillin fermentation with units, instrumentation tags, flow paths, and control philosophy (e.g., temperature/pH regulation via PID loops).*

### Prompt:
**PFD Penicillin Fermentation:**

Create a Process Flow Diagram (PFD) in textual notation for a fermentation process to produce penicillin. Include instrumentation and control philosophy.

**R-T-F:**
