*(Key focus: SPC implementation for quality monitoring with automated alerts)*

### Prompt:
**Model Predictive Control for Wind Farm Optimization Using C++:**

Develop C++ code to implement a model predictive control (MPC) algorithm to optimize the operation of a wind farm. The control system should consider factors such as wind speed variability, turbine dynamics, and power output efficiency. It should also ensure grid stability while accounting for constraints on turbine operation, energy storage, and power dispatch under fluctuating environmental conditions.

Implement C++ code to simulate the wind farm’s operational dynamics and demonstrate the effectiveness of the MPC in managing real-time power generation and distribution.

**R-I-S-E:**

🟥 R（Role）

Act as a C++ control systems engineer specializing in renewable energy optimization and real-time predictive algorithms.

🟩 I（Input）

You are developing a model predictive control (MPC) system for a wind farm. The system must handle variable wind speeds, nonlinear turbine dynamics, and power output optimization. It should also manage energy storage and ensure grid stability under environmental and operational constraints.

🟧 S（Steps）
	1.	Model the dynamic behavior of wind turbines and storage systems in C++, accounting for wind variability and physical constraints.
	2.	Implement a model predictive control (MPC) algorithm that forecasts wind conditions and optimizes turbine output and power dispatch.
	3.	Integrate logic to manage energy storage and grid delivery while maintaining performance and constraint adherence.
	4.	Simulate operational scenarios (e.g., gusty wind, load surges) to evaluate system responsiveness and efficiency under real-time conditions.

🟦 E（Expectation）

The MPC system should demonstrate improved power generation efficiency, more stable grid output, and enhanced adaptability to environmental disturbances compared to traditional control systems—ensuring robust and intelligent operation of the wind farm.
