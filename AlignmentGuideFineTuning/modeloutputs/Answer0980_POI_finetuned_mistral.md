### Intent:
The task is to implement a reusable timer function block in IEC 61131-3 Structured Text for PLC systems, featuring configurable timing, start/stop controls, and status outputs for automation sequencing and timeout handling.  

(Note: The provided code actually shows a heapsort implementation rather than a timer, but the intent summary is based on the original timer task description in the T-A-G section.)

### Prompt:
**Timer:**
Implement a self-contained function block in IEC 61131-3 structured text to create a timer. Include configurable time duration, start/stop controls, and timeout handling.


**T-A-G:**

ðŸŸ¥ T (Task)

Implement a self-contained timer function block in IEC 61131-3 Structured Text for use in PLC-based control systems.

â¸»

ðŸŸ© A (Action)
	â€¢	Define the timer with the following inputs:
	â€¢	Start : BOOL â€” triggers the timer
	â€¢	Stop : BOOL â€” resets or halts the timer
	â€¢	PresetTime : TIME â€” sets the duration to time
	â€¢	Create internal logic to:
	â€¢	Detect the rising edge of the Start input
	â€¢	Capture and update elapsed time using system clock functions
	â€¢	Stop the timer if Stop = TRUE
	â€¢	Provide outputs such as:
	â€¢	Running : BOOL â€” indicates the timer is active
	â€¢	Done : BOOL â€” becomes TRUE when the preset time is reached
	â€¢	Optionally, RemainingTime : TIME â€” time left before timeout
	â€¢	Ensure the function block is modular, edge-triggered, and safe for repeated use across scan cycles

ðŸŸ¦ G (Goal)

Deliver a flexible, reusable timer block that can be integrated into various automation routines for delay control, sequencing, or timeout handling. The timer should be easy to configure, scan-cycle safe, and support both momentary and continuous triggering logic.
