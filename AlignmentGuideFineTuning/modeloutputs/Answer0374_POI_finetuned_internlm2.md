### Intent:
**Intent Summary:**  
Create a reusable IEC 61131-3 Structured Text function block to convert Fahrenheit to Celsius with input validation (checking against absolute zero) and status flagging for industrial PLC applications.

### Prompt:
**Fahrenheit to Celsius:**
Implement a self-contained function block in IEC 61131-3 structured text to convert Fahrenheit to Celsius. Ensure it handles input validation and provides accurate results.

**C-A-R-E:**

ðŸŸ¥ C (Context) â€“ Background Situation

Temperature conversion between Fahrenheit and Celsius is frequently needed in industrial control systemsâ€”especially in HVAC, process heating, and international deployments. Relying on manual calculations or repeated code snippets can lead to inconsistencies, rounding errors, and logic duplication. A dedicated, reusable Structured Text function block ensures accuracy, validation, and consistent integration into PLC programs.

ðŸŸ© A (Action) â€“ Task to Perform

Create a self-contained function block in IEC 61131-3 Structured Text that:
	â€¢	Accepts a temperature input in Fahrenheit
	â€¢	Converts the value to Celsius using the formula:
 C = (F - 32) \times \frac{5}{9}
	â€¢	Performs input validation, such as checking that the input is not below absolute zero (âˆ’459.67Â°F)
	â€¢	Outputs the result in Celsius, along with a ValidInput boolean status flag
	â€¢	Includes clear comments, modular structure, and scan-cycle-safe logic

ðŸŸ¨ R (Result) â€“ Expected Outcome

The outcome should be a modular and reliable function block that can be reused in any program requiring Fahrenheit-to-Celsius conversion. It will offer:
	â€¢	Accurate results using real data types
	â€¢	Built-in validation to protect against invalid sensor readings
	â€¢	Clean, maintainable code suitable for both educational and production PLC applications

ðŸŸ¦ E (Example) â€“ Concrete Illustration

Example logic inside the function block:
IF Fahrenheit >= -459.67 THEN
   Celsius := (Fahrenheit - 32.0) * 5.0 / 9.0;
   ValidInput := TRUE;
ELSE
   Celsius := 0.0;
   ValidInput := FALSE;
END_IF;
Inputs:
	â€¢	Fahrenheit : REAL

Outputs:
	â€¢	Celsius : REAL
	â€¢	ValidInput : BOOL

ðŸŸª I (Implication) â€“ How It Affects the System

The function block will be used in industrial control systems to convert Fahrenheit to Celsius, ensuring accurate temperature readings and preventing system malfunctions due to invalid input. It will be integrated into PLC programs, providing a reliable and self-contained solution for temperature conversion.

**Fahrenheit to Celsius Conversion:**

Create a self-contained function block in IEC 61131-3 Structured Text to convert Fahrenheit to Celsius. The function block should accept a temperature input in Fahrenheit and output the equivalent temperature in Celsius. The conversion should be performed using the formula (F - 32) \* 5/9. The function block should also include input validation to ensure that the input temperature is not below absolute zero (âˆ’459.67Â°F). The output should include the converted temperature in Celsius and a status flag indicating whether the input was valid or not. The function block should be designed to be reusable and self-contained, with clear comments and modular structure.
