### Intent:
**Intent Summary:**  
Develop a Python-based model predictive control (MPC) system to optimize turbine performance in a thermal power plant, ensuring efficiency, stability, and robustness under dynamic operational constraints and disturbances.  

*(Focus: MPC implementation for turbine control with constraints, efficiency, and disturbance handling.)*

### Prompt:
**Model Predictive Control for Turbine Optimization in a Thermal Power Plant Using Python:**

Develop Python code to implement a model predictive control (MPC) algorithm for optimizing the operation of a turbine in a thermal power plant. The MPC should account for operational constraints, energy efficiency, and thermal dynamics, while ensuring robust performance under varying load conditions and external disturbances.

**T-A-G:**

ðŸŸ¥ Tï¼ˆTaskï¼‰

Implement a model predictive control (MPC) system in Python to optimize the operation of a turbine in a thermal power plant.

ðŸŸ© Aï¼ˆActionï¼‰

Develop a thermal and dynamic model of the turbine, then implement an MPC algorithm that manages control actions while accounting for operational constraints, energy efficiency requirements, and external disturbances. Simulate various load conditions to evaluate the controllerâ€™s robustness and performance.

ðŸŸ¦ Gï¼ˆGoalï¼‰

Achieve stable, efficient, and adaptive turbine control under dynamic operating conditions, improving energy usage and system reliability beyond what traditional control methods can offer.
