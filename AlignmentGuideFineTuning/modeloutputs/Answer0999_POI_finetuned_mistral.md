### Intent:
**Intent Summary:**  
Create a NORSOK-compliant textual System Control Diagram (SCD) for an LNG vaporizer system, detailing process flow, instrumentation (tagged per ISA-5.1), control loops (e.g., FT201 â†’ FIC201 â†’ FCV201), and safety interlocks (e.g., PSH301 â†’ ESD1), structured for design, HAZOP, and NORSOK I-005 compliance.  

*(Focused on LNG vaporizer control logic, instrumentation, and safety systems in standardized notation.)*

### Prompt:
**SCD LNG Vaporizer:**

Create a NORSOK system control diagram (SCD) in textual notation for a LNG Vaporizer System. Include instrumentation, control loops, and interlocks. Provide concrete tag numbers and piping.

ðŸŸ© A (Action)
	â€¢	Outline the full process flow from LNG inlet to gas outlet using arrows (-->) to indicate direction.
	â€¢	Include all relevant instrumentation and control loops, such as:
	â€¢	Flow control loop: FT201 â†’ FIC201 â†’ FCV201
	â€¢	Temperature control loop: TT101 â†’ TIC101 â†’ TCV101
	â€¢	Add interlocks for critical conditions like overpressure and overtemperature, e.g.:
	â€¢	PSH301 â†’ ESD1 (Shut Heater Steam)
	â€¢	TSH302 â†’ ESD2 (Block LNG Inlet)
	â€¢	Assign realistic tag numbers to all instruments and final control elements.

### Control Narrative for LNG Vaporizer System

#### 1. Purpose
The control narrative for the LNG vaporizer system is designed to ensure safe and efficient operation of the LNG vaporization process by specifying the control logic, setpoints, and interlocks for each stage of the process. This document serves as a reference for operators, engineers, and maintenance personnel to understand the operational intent, control strategy, and safety mechanisms of the LNG vaporizer system.

#### 2. Process Overview
The LNG vaporizer system receives LNG from an inlet at -162Â°C and converts it into gas at -161Â°C, ensuring safe and efficient vaporization. The process involves the following stages:
- LNG Inlet
- Preheating Section
- Vaporization Section
- Gas Outlet

#### 3. Control Narrative

##### 3.1 LNG Inlet

###### 3.1.1 Control Loop: LNG Flow Control
- **Setpoint**: LNG flow rate is maintained at 100 kg/h.
- **Control Element**: FCV101 (Flow Control Valve).
- **Measuring Device**: FT101 (Flow Transmitter).
- **Control Logic**: The flow control loop adjusts the opening of FCV101 based on the measured flow rate to maintain a steady flow of 100 kg/h.

###### 3.1.2 Interlock: Low LNG Flow
- **Condition**: If the measured flow rate drops below 90 kg/h.
- **Action**: The system triggers an alarm (ALM101) and shuts down the vaporization process by closing FCV101.

##### 3.2 Preheating Section

###### 3.2.1 Control Loop: Preheater Temperature Control
- **Setpoint**: Preheater temperature is maintained at 85Â°C.
- **Control Element**: TCV201 (Temperature Control Valve).
- **Measuring Device**: TT201 (Temperature Transmitter).
- **Control Logic**: The temperature control loop adjusts the opening of TCV201 based on the measured temperature
