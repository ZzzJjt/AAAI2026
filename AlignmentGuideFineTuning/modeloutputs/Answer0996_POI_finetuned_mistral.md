### Feedwater Control Loop - FBD in ASCII Art

#### Overview
This ASCII art diagram represents a simplified IEC 61131-3 Function Block Diagram (FBD) for a feedwater control loop in a steam-water cycle of a power plant. The diagram includes an Analog Input (AI), a TON timer, a PID controller, and an Analog Output (AO). The signal flow is clearly indicated, with arrows showing the direction of signal flow from the Analog Input to the PID controller and then to the Analog Output. This diagram is intended for use in text-based environments such as documentation, version control, or early-stage design reviews.

#### Detailed Explanation

##### Analog Input (AI)
The diagram begins with an Analog Input (AI) block, representing the feedwater flow sensor or transmitter. This block receives a continuous process variable (e.g., flow rate in L/min) from the field. The signal is typically in the range 0.0 to 100.0, but this can vary depending on the specific sensor and control requirements.

##### TON Timer
The Analog Input signal is passed to a TON (On-Delay) timer. This timer is used to activate the PID controller only when a predefined condition is met (e.g., when the feedwater flow exceeds a set threshold). The timer has two outputs:
- Q: Activates when the condition is met and remains active for a predefined duration (e.g., 10 seconds).
- .Q: Deactivates when the timer times out or when the condition is no longer met.

##### PID Controller
The PID controller receives the Analog Input (AI) and receives a setpoint from the system. The setpoint could be based on steam pressure, turbine load, or other system requirements. The PID controller adjusts the output signal based on the error between the setpoint and the measured value. The output of the PID controller is sent to the Analog Output (AO).

##### Analog Output (AO)
The Analog Output (AO) block receives the output from the PID controller and uses it to control a feedwater control valve or pump. The AO block converts the digital signal into an
