### Intent:
**Intent Summary:**  
Generate a 30-entry I/O list table for a steel rolling mill, including signal names, types, ranges, setpoints, and P&ID references, to standardize control system documentation and integration.  

**Code-Generation Intent:**  
*"Create a structured I/O list table with 30 entries for a rolling millâ€™s control system, covering analog/digital signals, engineering units, ranges, setpoints, and P&ID links."*

### Prompt:
**IO List Rolling Mill:**

Create an I/O list as a table with 30 lines for a rolling mill in a steel production plant. Have as columns signal name, input/output, signal tagnumber, analog/digital, engineering unit, ranges, setpoint, and P&ID reference.

**T-A-G:**

ðŸŸ¥ T (Task)

Develop a detailed I/O list table with 30 entries for a rolling mill in a steel production plant.

â¸»

ðŸŸ© A (Action)
	â€¢	Create a table with the following columns:
	â€¢	Signal Name
	â€¢	Input/Output
	â€¢	Signal Tagnumber
	â€¢	Analog/Digital
	â€¢	Engineering Unit
	â€¢	Range
	â€¢	Setpoint

(* Version: 1.0, Date: 2025-05-15 *)
(* Author: John Smith, Control Engineer, SteelTech *)

(* 1. INTRODUCTION *)

(* This program implements a PID controller for controlling the rolling mill's strip tension. *)
(* The controller adjusts the roll speed based on the measured strip tension, *)
(* ensuring that the strip remains within the desired tension range. *)
(* The controller is designed to operate in a PLC environment, using IEC 61131-3 Structured Text. *)
(* It includes configurable parameters for Kp, Ki, and Kd, as well as alarm conditions for *)
(* high and low strip tension. *)
