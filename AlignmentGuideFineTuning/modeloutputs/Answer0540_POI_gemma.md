### Intent:
The task is to create a structured text program for a traffic light control system that manages standard light sequencing, responds to pedestrian crossing requests, and prioritizes emergency vehicles by overriding normal operation when detected.  

**Intent Summary:**  
*"Implement a 61131-3 Structured Text traffic light controller with pedestrian crossing support and emergency vehicle priority."*

### Prompt:
**Traffic Light Control System Using 61131-3 Structured Text:**

Write a self-contained 61131-3 structured text program (not a function block) to control a traffic light system. The system should respond to pedestrian push buttons, allowing safe crossing by adjusting traffic light timings accordingly. Additionally, the system must detect the presence of emergency vehicles and prioritize their passage by adjusting the light sequence to provide a clear path. Implement logic to ensure smooth traffic flow while giving priority to safety and emergency response.

**R-I-S-E:**

ðŸŸ¥ R (Role) â€“ Your Role

You are a PLC programmer responsible for implementing an intelligent traffic light control system using IEC 61131-3 Structured Text (ST). Your job is to ensure smooth traffic operation, pedestrian safety, and emergency vehicle prioritization.

â¸»

ðŸŸ© I (Input) â€“ What Youâ€™re Given
	â€¢	Traffic light states:
	â€¢	0 = Red, 1 = Green, 2 = Yellow
	â€¢	Inputs:
	â€¢	PedestrianRequest (BOOL): Becomes TRUE when a pedestrian presses the crossing button.
	â€¢	EmergencyDetected (BOOL): Becomes TRUE when an emergency vehicle is detected.
	â€¢	Timers:
	â€¢	StateTimer (TON): Used to manage state durations (Red = 10s, Green = 10s, Yellow = 3s)

â¸»

ðŸŸ§ S (Steps) â€“ What You Need to Do
	1.	Implement standard traffic light sequencing using a CASE structure:
	â€¢	Green â†’ Yellow â†’ Red â†’ Greenâ€¦
	2.	Handle pedestrian crossing logic:
	â€¢	When in the Red state and PedestrianRequest is TRUE, extend the Red phase to allow safe crossing before switching to Green.
	3.	Respond to emergency vehicle detection:
	â€¢	If EmergencyDetected is TRUE, immediately override all current states and set the light to Green, bypassing all timers and pedestrian requests.
	â€¢	Once cleared, resume from the beginning of the cycle safely.
	4.	Reset state variables and timers appropriately:
	â€¢	After each transition, clear the pedestrian request if it was served.
	â€¢	Reset the timer and return to a clean state for the next sequence.

â¸»

ðŸŸ¦ E (Expectation) â€“ What Success Looks Like

Your Structured Text program will:
	â€¢	Ensure pedestrian safety by honoring crossing requests during Red
	â€¢	Provide priority access to emergency vehicles without compromising traffic logic
	â€¢	Maintain cyclical traffic control under normal conditions
	â€¢	Be modular, readable, and ready for integration into a larger traffic management system
