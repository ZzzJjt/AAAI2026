### Intent:
**Intent Summary:**  
Create a Structured Text function block to dynamically register/deregister CANOpen PDOs (Process Data Objects) or Layer 2 messages, with options to clear all registrations and buffer data, while ensuring robust error handling and network stability.  

*(Focus: CANOpen PDO management via ST, runtime flexibility, and safety.)*

### Prompt:
**CANOpen PDO Registration Using 61131-3 Structured Text:**

Develop a structured text (ST) function block named CAN_REGISTER_COBID based on IEC 61131 standards. The block will be responsible for registering or deleting a PDO (Process Data Object) or CAN Layer 2 message for reception by the network layer. When the REGISTER input is set to TRUE, the specified COBID (CAN identifier) will be registered for receiving messages. If REGISTER is set to FALSE, the registration of the respective COBID will be deleted. Additionally, when REGISTER is FALSE and COBID is set to 0, all registrations and messages stored in the network layer buffer will be cleared. Discuss the function blockâ€™s implementation, including error handling, network communication management, and memory buffer clearing mechanisms.

**T-A-G:**

ðŸŸ¥ T (Task) â€“ What You Need to Do

Design a Structured Text (ST) function block named CAN_REGISTER_COBID using the IEC 61131-3 standard to manage registration and deregistration of PDOs or CAN Layer 2 messages in a CANOpen network.

ðŸŸ© A (Action) â€“ How to Do It

Implement logic so that when REGISTER = TRUE, the function block registers the specified COBID for receiving messages. When REGISTER = FALSE, it removes the registration. If REGISTER = FALSE and COBID = 0, the function block should clear all registrations and network buffer data. Include robust error handling, communication status checks, and safe memory buffer management within the function block.

ðŸŸ¦ G (Goal) â€“ What Success Looks Like

Enable dynamic and reliable management of CANOpen message registrations during runtime, ensuring communication stability, flexibility, and system safety across changing operational requirements.
