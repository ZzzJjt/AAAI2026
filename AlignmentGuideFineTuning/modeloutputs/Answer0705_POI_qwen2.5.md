### Intent:
The task is to implement a model predictive control (MPC) system in Python that optimizes continuous cellulose fiber production by managing material flow through a two-stage batch process with time delays and fluctuating demand, ensuring high buffer tank levels to prevent downstream disruptions.  

(Key elements: MPC, hybrid continuous-batch process, delay compensation, demand variability, tank level maintenance)

### Prompt:
**Model Predictive Control for Continuous Cellulose Fiber Production Using Python:**

Explain how model predictive control (MPC) can optimize cellulose fiber production from wood, where continuous infeed and outfeed operations are required, while the material undergoes a two-stage batch process. The material is supplied at an average rate of 50 tons per hour, undergoing pre-treatment in a reactor followed by homogenization before entering a 1,000 cubic meter buffer tank. The product is extracted from the tank on demand, not at a constant rate. To minimize downtime in downstream processes, a high fill level in the tank must be maintained, despite the two-hour delay caused by upstream batch processes, making PID control unsuitable.

Develop Python code to simulate the system dynamics, including the dead time and fluctuating demand.

Implement Python code for a model predictive control (MPC) algorithm to optimize material flow, taking into account the time delay, fluctuating demand, and operational constraints.

	â€¢	An MPC implementation that includes constraint handling and disturbance prediction
	â€¢	Console outputs or logs of tank levels and feed rate over time (no plots required unless specified) To implement a model predictive control (MPC) system in Python for optimizing continuous cellulose fiber production, we'll follow these steps:

1. **Define the System Dynamics**: We'll create a simple model of the reactor, homogenizer, and buffer tank system.
2. **Implement MPC Algorithm**: We'll use an MPC algorithm to adjust the infeed rate to maintain a high buffer tank level.
3. **Simulate the System**: We'll simulate the system dynamics and MPC control over time.

Here's the Python code to achieve this:

```python
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Define system parameters
reactor_capacity = 100  # m^3
homogenizer_capacity = 100  # m^3
buffer_tank_capacity = 1000  # m^3
infeed_rate = 50  # tons/hour
demand_rate = 50  # tons/hour
dead_time = 2  # hours

# Define MPC parameters
horizon = 10  # prediction horizon
control_horizon = 5  # control horizon
Q = np.eye(horizon)  # state cost matrix
R = np.eye(control_horizon)  # input cost matrix
Qf = np.eye(horizon)  # terminal state cost matrix
Rf = np.eye(control_horizon)  # terminal input cost matrix

# Define MPC function
def mpc_control(tank_level, demand_rate, infeed_rate, dead_time, horizon, control_horizon, Q, R, Qf, Rf):
    # Define state and input matrices
    A = np.eye(horizon)
    B = np.eye(control_horizon)
    
    # Define cost matrices
    P = np.zeros((horizon, horizon))
    for i in range(horizon):
        P[i, i] = Q[i, i]
    Pf = np.zeros((horizon, horizon))
    for i in range(horizon):
        Pf[i, i] = Qf[i, i]
    
    # Define constraints
    min_infeed_rate = 0
    max_infeed_rate = 100
    
    # Define MPC problem
    x = np.zeros((horizon, 1))
    u = np.zeros((control_horizon, 1))
    for i in range(horizon):
        x[i, 0] = tank_level
    for i
