### Intent:
**Intent Summary:**  
Create a reusable IEC 61131-3 structured text function block to convert Fahrenheit to Celsius with input validation (rejecting values below absolute zero) and precise floating-point arithmetic for industrial automation systems.

### Prompt:
**Fahrenheit to Celsius:**
Implement a self-contained function block in IEC 61131-3 structured text to convert Fahrenheit to Celsius. Ensure it handles input validation and provides accurate results.


**B-A-B:**

ðŸŸ¥ B (Before) â€“ The Problem or Challenge

In industrial automation systems, especially those involving HVAC, thermal processing, or sensor integration, temperature values may be provided in Fahrenheit while the control logic or displays require Celsius. Without a standardized, reusable function block, engineers may repeatedly rewrite conversion logic or risk incorrect scaling, lack of input validation, or inconsistent formatting across projects.

ðŸŸ© A (After) â€“ The Desired Outcome

Create a self-contained function block in IEC 61131-3 Structured Text that converts a given Fahrenheit temperature to Celsius. The function should:
	â€¢	Use the formula:
C = (F - 32) \times \frac{5}{9}
	â€¢	Accept a REAL or LREAL Fahrenheit input
	â€¢	Provide a validated, accurate Celsius output
	â€¢	Include input validation (e.g., to reject unphysical inputs like below absolute zero)
	â€¢	Be reusable, modular, and safe for use in scan-cycle environments

â¸»

ðŸŸ§ B (Bridge) â€“ How to Get There
	1.	Define the function block with:
	â€¢	Fahrenheit : REAL (input)
	â€¢	Celsius : REAL (output)
	â€¢	ValidInput : BOOL (output flag)
	2.	Add logic to:
	â€¢	Validate that the Fahrenheit input is above -459.67Â°F (absolute zero)
	â€¢	Perform the conversion using precise floating-point arithmetic
	3.	Include comments and documentation for readability and maintainability
	4.	Optionally, set Celsius to 0 and ValidInput to FALSE if the input is invalid

**C-A-R-E:**

ðŸŸ¥ C (Context) â€“ The Background

In industrial automation systems, temperature values are often required in Celsius for control logic, safety limits, or display purposes. However, many sensors and protocols provide Fahrenheit values. Without a standardized function block, engineers may repeatedly rewrite conversion logic, risk incorrect scaling, or lack input validation, leading to inconsistent results and potential safety hazards.
