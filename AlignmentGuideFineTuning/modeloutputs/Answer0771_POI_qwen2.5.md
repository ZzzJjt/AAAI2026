### Intent:
**Intent Summary:**  
Design a structured start-up and shutdown sequence in IEC 61131-3 Structured Text for a 3D pouch making machine, ensuring sequential activation/deactivation of heating/cooling stations, tension control via feeders, cutter synchronization, and safe parameterized procedures with timers and conditions.  

*(Focus: Machine sequencing, tension management, safety, and synchronization in packaging automation.)*

### Prompt:
**3D Pouch Making Machine:**

Design a detailed start-up and shutdown sequence for a 3D pouch making machine in IEC 61131-3 Structured Text. The machine consists of 8 heating stations, 8 cooling stations, one horizontal cutter, one vertical cutter, and two feeder units responsible for raw material feeding. Winding tension management is critical throughout the process to ensure proper tension in the raw material.

Write a structured start-up sequence that sequentially activates the heating and cooling stations, regulates the feeder units to maintain optimal tension, and ensures proper synchronization between the cutters and material flow. Additionally, create a shutdown sequence that safely deactivates each component in the correct order, ensuring proper cooling and tension release.

Ensure the program includes typical parameter values, timers, and conditions for each stage of the start-up and shutdown procedures, and discuss the importance of winding tension in maintaining machine efficiency and product quality.

Provide a complete IEC 61131-3 Structured Text program with:
	â€¢	Clearly structured code blocks for start-up and shutdown
	â€¢	Descriptive variable names and parameter values (e.g., temperature thresholds, delay times)
	â€¢	In-line comments explaining each control step
	â€¢	Logical sequencing using IF/ELSIF statements, timers, and mode/state management variables
