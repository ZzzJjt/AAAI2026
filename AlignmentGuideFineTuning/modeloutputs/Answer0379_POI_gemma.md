### Intent:
**Intent Summary:**  
Create a reusable IEC 61131-3 function block in Structured Text to compare two REAL numbers with configurable decimal precision, handling rounding errors and invalid inputs, for reliable industrial control logic.  

*(Focus: Precision-aware floating-point comparison, error handling, modularity for automation systems.)*

### Prompt:
**Real Comparator:**
Implement a self-contained function block in IEC 61131-3 structured text to compare two real inputs up to n decimal places. Include configurable precision and error handling.

**C-A-R-E:**

🟥 C (Context) – Background Situation

In industrial automation, comparing floating-point numbers (REAL values) directly can lead to unpredictable results due to rounding errors and precision limits inherent to binary floating-point representation. This is especially problematic in control logic, threshold detection, or alarm handling where precise decimal-level comparisons are required. A configurable comparator that accounts for decimal precision helps ensure stable and reliable logic decisions.

🟩 A (Action) – Task to Perform

Develop a self-contained function block in IEC 61131-3 Structured Text to compare two REAL inputs with a configurable number of decimal places. The function block should:
	•	Take Input1, Input2 : REAL and Precision : INT as inputs
	•	Round both inputs to the specified precision using a scaling method
	•	Compare the results and set output flags:
	•	Equal : BOOL
	•	Greater : BOOL
	•	Less : BOOL
	•	Include input validation and an Error : BOOL output in case of invalid precision values
	•	Be written for scan-cycle safety and modular reuse

⸻

🟨 R (Result) – Expected Outcome

The result is a modular, reusable comparator block that accurately determines equality or relational order between two REAL values up to n decimal places, ensuring:
	•	Robust performance under rounding constraints
	•	Clarity in control flow logic
	•	Safe handling of erroneous or extreme inputs
	•	Easy integration into PID tuning, setpoint checks, or quality monitoring systems

🟦 E (Example) – Concrete Illustration

Example logic (simplified):

Scale := POWER(10, Precision);
Rounded1 := REAL_TO_INT(Input1 * Scale);
Rounded2 := REAL_TO_INT(Input2 * Scale);

Equal := (Rounded1 = Rounded2);
Greater := (Rounded1 > Rounded2);
Less := (Rounded1 < Rounded2);
Error := (Precision < 0);

Inputs:
	•	Input1, Input2 : REAL
	•	Precision : INT
	•	Enable : BOOL

Outputs:
	•	Equal, Greater, Less, Error : BOOL

**Example:**
The example logic is provided as a simplified illustration of the comparator function block. The function block takes Input1, Input2 : REAL and Precision : INT as inputs, scales the inputs by the specified precision, rounds the scaled inputs to the nearest integer, and compares the results to set output flags: Equal : BOOL, Greater : BOOL, Less : BOOL, and Error : BOOL. The function block also includes input validation to ensure that the precision value is non-negative.
