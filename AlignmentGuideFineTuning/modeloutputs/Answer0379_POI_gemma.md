### Intent:
**Intent Summary:**  
Create a reusable IEC 61131-3 function block in Structured Text to compare two REAL numbers with configurable decimal precision, handling rounding errors and invalid inputs, for reliable industrial control logic.  

*(Focus: Precision-aware floating-point comparison, error handling, modularity for automation systems.)*

### Prompt:
**Real Comparator:**
Implement a self-contained function block in IEC 61131-3 structured text to compare two real inputs up to n decimal places. Include configurable precision and error handling.

**C-A-R-E:**

ğŸŸ¥ C (Context) â€“ Background Situation

In industrial automation, comparing floating-point numbers (REAL values) directly can lead to unpredictable results due to rounding errors and precision limits inherent to binary floating-point representation. This is especially problematic in control logic, threshold detection, or alarm handling where precise decimal-level comparisons are required. A configurable comparator that accounts for decimal precision helps ensure stable and reliable logic decisions.

ğŸŸ© A (Action) â€“ Task to Perform

Develop a self-contained function block in IEC 61131-3 Structured Text to compare two REAL inputs with a configurable number of decimal places. The function block should:
	â€¢	Take Input1, Input2 : REAL and Precision : INT as inputs
	â€¢	Round both inputs to the specified precision using a scaling method
	â€¢	Compare the results and set output flags:
	â€¢	Equal : BOOL
	â€¢	Greater : BOOL
	â€¢	Less : BOOL
	â€¢	Include input validation and an Error : BOOL output in case of invalid precision values
	â€¢	Be written for scan-cycle safety and modular reuse

â¸»

ğŸŸ¨ R (Result) â€“ Expected Outcome

The result is a modular, reusable comparator block that accurately determines equality or relational order between two REAL values up to n decimal places, ensuring:
	â€¢	Robust performance under rounding constraints
	â€¢	Clarity in control flow logic
	â€¢	Safe handling of erroneous or extreme inputs
	â€¢	Easy integration into PID tuning, setpoint checks, or quality monitoring systems

ğŸŸ¦ E (Example) â€“ Concrete Illustration

Example logic (simplified):

Scale := POWER(10, Precision);
Rounded1 := REAL_TO_INT(Input1 * Scale);
Rounded2 := REAL_TO_INT(Input2 * Scale);

Equal := (Rounded1 = Rounded2);
Greater := (Rounded1 > Rounded2);
Less := (Rounded1 < Rounded2);
Error := (Precision < 0);

Inputs:
	â€¢	Input1, Input2 : REAL
	â€¢	Precision : INT
	â€¢	Enable : BOOL

Outputs:
	â€¢	Equal, Greater, Less, Error : BOOL

The action is to develop a self-contained function block in IEC 61131-3 Structured Text to compare two REAL inputs with a configurable number of decimal places. The function block should take Input1, Input2 : REAL and Precision : INT as inputs, round both inputs to the specified precision using a scaling method, compare the results and set output flags: Equal : BOOL, Greater : BOOL, Less : BOOL, and include input validation and an Error : BOOL output in case of invalid precision values.

The result is a modular, reusable comparator block that accurately determines equality or relational order between two REAL values up to n decimal places, ensuring robust performance under rounding constraints, clarity in control flow logic, safe handling of erroneous or extreme inputs, and easy integration into PID tuning, setpoint checks, or quality monitoring systems.

**Example:**
The example logic is provided as a simplified illustration of the comparator function block. The function block takes Input1, Input2 : REAL and Precision : INT as inputs, scales the inputs by the specified precision, rounds the scaled inputs to the nearest integer, and compares the results to set output flags: Equal : BOOL, Greater : BOOL, Less : BOOL, and Error : BOOL. The function block also includes input validation to ensure that the precision value is non-negative.

**Intent Summary:**  
Create a reusable IEC 61131-3 function block in Structured Text to compare two REAL numbers with configurable decimal precision, handling rounding errors and invalid inputs, for reliable industrial control logic.
