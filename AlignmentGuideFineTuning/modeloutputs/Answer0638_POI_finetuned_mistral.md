### Intent:
**Intent Summary:**  
Develop an IEC 61131-3 Structured Text program to safely and gradually shut down a steel production facility by controlling furnace temperature, fuel gas flow (ramped down over 12 hours), and oxygen levels (maintaining a 1:2.5 fuel-to-air ratio), with modular functions for sequencing and safety interlocks.

### Prompt:
**Shutdown Steel Production:**

Develop a comprehensive list of steps for the controlled shutdown of a steel production facility. Include key stages such as reducing furnace temperature, controlling gas flow rates, and maintaining safe oxygen levels throughout the shutdown process.

Provide a detailed control narrative for steps 4 to 6 of the shutdown sequence, specifying concrete ranges and setpoints for variables such as temperature, gas flow, and oxygen levels.

Write a self-contained IEC 61131-3 Structured Text program based on this control narrative, ensuring proper sequencing and safety protocols.

Additionally, create a function in IEC 61131-3 to gradually reduce the fuel gas flow rate to the furnace burners over a period of 12 hours. This function should incorporate timing and safety checks to ensure smooth transitions.

Lastly, write an IEC 61131-3 function for adjusting the oxygen supply to the burners to maintain a precise fuel-to-air ratio of 1:2.5 during the shutdown. Ensure the function is adaptable to fluctuations in gas flow and temperature, and include safeguards for maintaining combustion efficiency.

ðŸŸ© I (Input) â€“ Information Provided

You are required to:
	â€¢	Design a controlled shutdown procedure for a steel plant.
	â€¢	Cover steps such as reducing furnace temperature, ramping down fuel gas flow, and maintaining safe oxygen levels.
	â€¢	Focus particularly on steps 4 to 6 in the sequence, which include precise temperature control, gas flow reduction, and oxygen regulation.
	â€¢	Include a Structured Text program that sequences these operations with timers and safety interlocks.
	â€¢	Write two IEC 61131-3 functions:
	1.	One to reduce fuel gas flow over a 12-hour period.
	2.	One to adjust oxygen supply dynamically to maintain a 1:2.5 fuel-to-air ratio, with adaptability to gas flow and temperature variations.

â¸»

ðŸŸ§ S (Steps) â€“ Implementation Steps
	1.	Define the overall shutdown sequence, with clearly labeled stages (e.g., Furnace Cooling, Gas Ramp-Down, Oxygen Adjustment).
	2.	Write a control narrative for steps 4â€“6, specifying exact setpoints such as:
	â€¢	Target temperature: < 400Â°C
	â€¢	Gas flow ramp: 100% to 0% over 12 hours
	â€¢	Fuel-to-air ratio: 1:2.5, adjusted in real-time
	3.	Implement the Structured Text logic for the sequence using timers (TON), analog comparisons, and safety interlocks.
	4.	Create a function for linear flow reduction based on elapsed time.
	5.	Develop a second function that calculates and regulates the oxygen supply dynamically, including safety limits and alarms.
	6.	Add comments and modular code structure for clarity and ease of maintenance.

ðŸŸ¦ E (Expectation) â€“ Expected Outcome

The final solution will be a robust and modular IEC 61131-3 control program that enables a safe, efficient, and traceable shutdown of the steel facility. It will ensure:
	â€¢	Thermal safety through gradual temperature reduction
	â€¢	Combustion efficiency via real-time oxygen adjustment
	â€¢	Smooth fuel transition through long-duration gas ramp-down
	â€¢	ISA-88-aligned sequencing that is adaptable, scalable, and easy to integrate with plant systems
