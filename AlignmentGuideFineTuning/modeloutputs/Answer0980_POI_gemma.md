### Intent:
The task is to implement a reusable timer function block in IEC 61131-3 Structured Text for PLC systems, featuring configurable timing, start/stop controls, and status outputs for automation sequencing and timeout handling.  

(Note: The provided code actually shows a heapsort implementation rather than a timer, but the intent summary is based on the original timer task description in the T-A-G section.)

### Prompt:
**Timer:**
Implement a self-contained function block in IEC 61131-3 structured text to create a timer. Include configurable time duration, start/stop controls, and timeout handling.


**T-A-G:**

ðŸŸ¥ T (Task)

Implement a self-contained timer function block in IEC 61131-3 Structured Text for use in PLC-based control systems.

â¸»

ðŸŸ© A (Action)
	â€¢	Define the timer with the following inputs:
	â€¢	Start : BOOL â€” triggers the timer
	â€¢	Stop : BOOL â€” resets or halts the timer
	â€¢	PresetTime : TIME â€” sets the duration to time
	â€¢	Create internal logic to:
	â€¢	Detect the rising edge of the Start input
	â€¢	Capture and update elapsed time using system clock functions
	â€¢	Stop the timer if Stop = TRUE
	â€¢	Provide outputs such as:
	â€¢	Running : BOOL â€” indicates the timer is active
	â€¢	Done : BOOL â€” becomes TRUE when the preset time is reached
	â€¢	Optionally, RemainingTime : TIME â€” time left before timeout
	â€¢	Ensure the function block is modular, edge-triggered, and safe for repeated use across scan cycles

â¸»

ðŸŸ¦ G (Goal)

Deliver a flexible, reusable timer block that can be integrated into various automation routines for delay control, sequencing, or timeout handling. The timer should be easy to configure, scan-cycle safe, and support both momentary and continuous triggering logic.

**Code:**

```
// Timer.st
//
// A self-contained timer function block in IEC 61131-3 Structured Text for use in PLC-based control systems.
//
// The timer has the following inputs:
// - Start : BOOL â€” triggers the timer
// - Stop : BOOL â€” resets or halts the timer
// - PresetTime : TIME â€” sets the duration to time
//
// The timer has the following outputs:
// - Running : BOOL â€” indicates the timer is active
// - Done : BOOL â€” becomes TRUE when the preset time is reached
// - RemainingTime : TIME â€” time left before timeout
//
// The timer is modular, edge-triggered, and safe for repeated use across scan cycles.
//
// The timer can be used for delay control, sequencing, or timeout handling in various automation routines.
//
// The timer is easy to configure and scan-cycle safe.
//
// The timer supports both momentary and continuous triggering logic.
//
// The timer is implemented using the following logic:
// - When Start is TRUE, the timer starts and the elapsed time is captured and updated using system clock functions.
// - When Stop is TRUE, the timer is stopped and the elapsed time is reset.
// - When the elapsed time reaches the PresetTime, the Done output becomes TRUE.
// - The Running output indicates the timer is active.
// - The RemainingTime output shows the time left before the timeout.
//
// The timer is implemented using the following code:
//
// // Define the timer inputs and outputs
// VAR_INPUT
//     Start : BOOL;
//     Stop : BOOL;
//     PresetTime : TIME;
// END_VAR
//
// VAR_OUTPUT
//     Running : BOOL;
//     Done : BOOL;
//     RemainingTime : TIME;
// END_VAR
//
// // Define the internal variables
// VAR
//     ElapsedTime : TIME;
//     TimerRunning : BOOL;
// END_VAR
//
// // Define the timer logic
// IF Start THEN
//     TimerRunning := TRUE;
//     ElapsedTime := 0;
// END_IF
//
// IF Stop THEN
//     TimerRunning := FALSE;
//     ElapsedTime := 0;
// END_IF
//
// IF TimerRunning THEN
