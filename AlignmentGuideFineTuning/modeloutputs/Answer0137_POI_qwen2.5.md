Explain how inheritance is implemented in IEC 61131-3, building on the previous example to show how derived classes can extend base functionality. Additionally, refine the example further to demonstrate polymorphism within this framework, discussing its practical applications and constraints.

**B-A-B:**

ðŸŸ¥ Before â€“ The Starting Point

Traditionally, IEC 61131-3 has been known for its procedural programming paradigm, widely used in industrial automation. While effective for many control tasks, Version 2.0 lacked modern programming constructs like classes, inheritance, and polymorphism, making it harder to modularize and reuse code across complex systems.

ðŸŸ© After â€“ The Desired Outcome

With the introduction of IEC 61131-3 Version 3.0, developers can now leverage object-oriented programming (OOP) principles such as:
	â€¢	Classes and methods to encapsulate logic
	â€¢	Inheritance to create reusable and extendable components
	â€¢	Polymorphism to generalize control behavior and simplify integration

You will provide:
	â€¢	A clear explanation of how classes and methods are defined and used in IEC 61131-3
	â€¢	A realistic example (e.g., a base class for a generic actuator and a subclass for a specific type)
	â€¢	A discussion of the benefits and limitations of using OOP in PLCs
	â€¢	An extension of the example to illustrate inheritance and then further to demonstrate polymorphism
	â€¢	A reflection on the practical constraints of using these OOP features in industrial environments (e.g., scan cycle management, memory use, debugging)

ðŸŸ¦ Bridge â€“ How to Get There

To bridge the procedural-to-OOP transition:
	1.	Start with an overview of the structural enhancements introduced in IEC 61131-3 Version 3.0.
	2.	Define a simple class structure, showing encapsulation through methods and variables.
	3.	Build on this to show how inheritance allows one function block (e.g., ValveController) to extend another (e.g., Actuator).
	4.	Then, demonstrate polymorphism, such as calling a method like Start() from a base class interface, but executing subclass-specific behavior.
	5.	Conclude with a thoughtful evaluation: when and why to use these featuresâ€”and when not toâ€”in the context of real-time industrial automation.

**Before â€“ The Starting Point**

In IEC 61131-3 Version 2.0, the programming paradigm was primarily procedural, with a focus on sequential execution of instructions. While effective for many control tasks, this approach lacked modern programming constructs like classes, inheritance, and polymorphism, making it harder to modularize and reuse code across complex systems.

**After â€“ The Desired Outcome**

With the introduction of IEC 61131-3 Version 3.0, developers can now leverage object-oriented programming (OOP) principles to create more modular, reusable, and maintainable code. This includes:

* **Classes**: Encapsulate data and behavior into reusable units.
* **Methods**: Define functions that operate on class data.
* **Inheritance**: Create new classes that inherit properties and methods from existing classes.
* **Polymorphism**: Allow objects of different classes to be treated as if they were of the same class.

**Example: Actuator and ValveController**

Let's consider a simple example where we have a base class `Actuator` and a derived class `ValveController`.

```pascal
// Base class: Actuator
FUNCTION_BLOCK Actuator
VAR
    Position : REAL;
END_VAR

METHODS
    SetPosition : VOID;
END_METHOD
END_FUNCTION_BLOCK

// Derived class: ValveController
FUNCTION_BLOCK ValveController
INHERITS Actuator
VAR
    OpenPosition : REAL := 0.5;
    ClosedPosition : REAL := 0.0;
END_VAR

METHODS
    Open : VOID;
    Close : VOID;
END_METHOD
END_FUNCTION_BLOCK

// Implementation of methods
METHOD ValveController::Open
    Position := OpenPosition;
END_METHOD

METHOD ValveController::Close
    Position := ClosedPosition;
END_METHOD
```

**Benefits and Limitations**

Using OOP in PLCs offers several benefits:

* **Modularity**: Code can be broken down into smaller, reusable components.
* **Reusability**: Existing classes can be extended or modified to create new functionality.
* **Maintainability**: Changes to one part of the system do not affect other parts.

However, there are also limitations to consider:

* **Memory usage**: Creating multiple instances of classes can consume significant memory.
* **Scan cycle management**: OOP features may introduce additional overhead, potentially affecting scan cycle
