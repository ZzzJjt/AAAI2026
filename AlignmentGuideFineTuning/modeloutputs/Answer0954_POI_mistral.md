### Intent:
The task involves developing an ISA-88-compliant batch control recipe and automation program in IEC 61131-3 Structured Text to produce 100 kg of cocoa milk, specifying ingredients, processing parameters, and sequential control logic for mixing, heating, and blending phases. 

**Intent Summary:**  
*"Create a modular, scalable batch control program for cocoa milk production that follows ISA-88 standards, with ingredient dosing, temperature-controlled mixing, and industrial integration capabilities."*

### Prompt:
**Batch Cocoa Milk:**

Create an ISA-88 batch control recipe for producing 100 kg of cocoa milk, detailing the required ingredients, including milk, water, liquid sugar, and cocoa. The equipment should consist of a mixing and blending vessel capable of stirring and heating. Specify appropriate amounts for each ingredient, as well as optimal mixing temperatures and heating times.

Write a self-contained program in IEC 61131-3 Structured Text for the sequential control of the mixing process, incorporating typical parameter values such as stirring speed, temperature control, and time duration. Ensure the program follows ISA-88 principles, with clear logic for controlling the heating and blending phases. Discuss the challenges in scaling and optimizing the control process for industrial production.

ðŸŸ¥ T (Task)

Develop an ISA-88-compliant batch control recipe and automation program for producing 100 kg of cocoa milk using IEC 61131-3 Structured Text.

ðŸŸ© A (Action)

Specify the required ingredientsâ€”milk, water, liquid sugar, and cocoaâ€”along with their respective quantities. Define the processing parameters such as heating temperature (e.g., 70Â°C), stirring speed (e.g., 200 RPM), and mixing duration (e.g., 10 minutes). Write a self-contained Structured Text program that controls the sequential execution of the mixing process, including ingredient addition, heating, and blending. Ensure the program structure reflects ISA-88 principles, with modular logic and clearly defined phases.

ðŸŸ¦ G (Goal)

Deliver a robust, modular, and scalable control program that ensures product consistency, process efficiency, and easy integration into industrial batch control systems, supporting future adjustments in batch size or formula while maintaining ISA-88 compliance.
