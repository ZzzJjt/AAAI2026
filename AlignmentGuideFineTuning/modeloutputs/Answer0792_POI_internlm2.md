	â€¢	Startup: Initialize controllers, ramp up feed flows, preheat reactor, activate ratio and pH control
	â€¢	Steady-State: Maintain PID loops, monitor deviation alarms, and log key values
	â€¢	Shutdown: Isolate feeds, depressurize, stop heating, drain reactor contents
	5.	Interlocks and Alarms
	â€¢	Temperature > 185â€¯Â°C â†’ emergency shutdown
	â€¢	Pressure > 5.2â€¯bar â†’ close feed valves
	â€¢	pH < 5.5 â†’ alarm + reduce ammonia flow

ðŸŸ¨ C (Content) â€“ Provide the Control Narrative

1.	Process Overview
	â€¢	Purpose: The ammonium nitrate reactor is designed to neutralize nitric acid with ammonia, producing a stable and high-purity ammonium nitrate solution. The reactor employs a continuous stirred tank reactor (CSTR) design, which allows for efficient mixing and heat transfer.
	â€¢	Normal flow conditions: The reactor operates at a constant flow rate of 100â€¯mÂ³/h, with a 1:1 ammonia:acid ratio. The temperature is maintained at 175â€¯Â°C, and the pH is controlled within a range of 5.8â€“6.5.
	â€¢	Operational limits: The reactor can withstand a maximum pressure of 5.2â€¯bar and a minimum temperature of 160â€¯Â°C. Any deviation from these setpoints may result in process instability or safety hazards.
2.	Key Setpoints and Ranges
	â€¢	Temperature (TIC-101): The temperature setpoint is 175â€¯Â°C, with an acceptable range of 173â€¯Â°C to 177â€¯Â°C. Any deviation from this range may indicate a process disturbance or equipment malfunction.
	â€¢	Pressure (PIC-102): The pressure setpoint is 4.8â€¯bar, with an acceptable range of 4.6â€¯bar to 5.0â€¯bar. Any deviation from this range may indicate a potential safety hazard or equipment failure.
	â€¢	Ammonia:Acid Ratio (FRC-103): The desired ratio is 1.01:1, with a tolerance of Â±0.05. Any significant deviation from this ratio may impact the product quality or process stability.
	â€¢	pH Control (AIC-105): The target pH is 6.2, with an acceptable range of 5.8 to 6.5. Any deviation from this range may indicate a need for process adjustments or quality control measures.
3.	Instrumentation and Equipment
	â€¢	Flow transmitters (FIC-103, FIC-104): These devices measure the flow rates of ammonia and nitric acid, providing feedback for the flow ratio control
