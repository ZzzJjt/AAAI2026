ðŸŸ© I (Input) â€“ What Youâ€™re Given

You need to implement a function block that calculates the Poisson distribution probability, given:

The output should be:
	â€¢	Probability : REAL â€” the probability that K events occur given a rate Lambda
	â€¢	Based on the Poisson probability mass function:
P(k; \lambda) = \frac{e^{-\lambda} \cdot \lambda^k}{k!}

	â€¢	Overflow and precision loss with large values of Î» or k
	â€¢	Executing efficiently within a real-time PLC scan cycle
	â€¢	Proper domain checks (e.g., Lambda > 0, K â‰¥ 0)

ðŸŸ§ S (Steps) â€“ What You Need to Do
	1.	Define a function block named PoissonProbability with the following structure:
 FUNCTION_BLOCK PoissonProbability
VAR_INPUT
    Lambda : REAL;
    K : INT;
END_VAR
VAR_OUTPUT
    Probability : REAL;
END_VAR
	2.	Add logic to calculate factorial for K:
 VAR
    i : INT;
    Factorial : REAL := 1.0;
END_VAR

FOR i := 1 TO K DO
    Factorial := Factorial * i;
END_FOR;
	3.	Compute the Poisson probability:
 IF (Lambda > 0) AND (K >= 0) THEN
    Probability := EXP(-Lambda) * POW(Lambda, K) / Factorial;
ELSE
    Probability := 0.0;
END_IF;
	4.	Add inline comments explaining:
	â€¢	Each step of the Poisson formula
	â€¢	Why factorial is manually computed (no built-in factorial in ST)
	â€¢	How floating-point math affects precision
	â€¢	Consideration of upper limits for K to prevent overflow

ðŸŸ¦ E (Expectation) â€“ What Success Looks Like

You deliver a compact and accurate function block that:
	â€¢	Computes Poisson probabilities reliably for typical values of Lambda and K
	â€¢	Avoids crashing or incorrect output for edge cases (e.g. negative inputs)
	â€¢	Executes quickly enough for inclusion in real-time event monitoring applications
	â€¢	Can be reused in use cases such as:
	â€¢	Predicting machine failure rates
	â€¢	Sensor event tracking over time intervals
	â€¢	Process bottleneck analysis

**Practical Applications in Industrial Systems**

The Poisson distribution is particularly useful in industrial systems for modeling and predicting the occurrence of rare events, such as machine failures, sensor malfunctions, or process bottlenecks. By accurately calculating the probability of these events, engineers can:

1. **Predict Maintenance Needs**: Estimate the likelihood of a machine failing within a given time frame, allowing for proactive maintenance scheduling.
2. **Optimize Sensor Placement**: Determine the optimal number of sensors needed to monitor a process, ensuring that the system can detect anomalies without being overwhelmed by false positives.
3. **Analyze Process Bottlenecks**: Identify the most likely points of failure in a production line, enabling targeted improvements to increase efficiency and reduce downtime.
4. **Risk Management**: Assess the risk of rare but catastrophic events, such as equipment failures or process upsets, and develop contingency plans to mitigate their impact.

By incorporating the Poisson distribution into industrial control systems, engineers can make more informed decisions, improve system reliability, and enhance overall operational efficiency.
