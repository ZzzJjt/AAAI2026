### Intent:
The task is to implement a model predictive control (MPC) system in C++ for optimizing wind farm operations by dynamically adjusting power generation and storage under fluctuating wind conditions while maintaining grid stability and efficiency.  

**Intent Summary:**  
*"Develop C++ MPC code to optimize real-time wind farm power output under variable conditions while respecting operational constraints."*

### Prompt:
**Model Predictive Control for Wind Farm Optimization Using C++:**

Develop C++ code to implement a model predictive control (MPC) algorithm to optimize the operation of a wind farm. The control system should consider factors such as wind speed variability, turbine dynamics, and power output efficiency. It should also ensure grid stability while accounting for constraints on turbine operation, energy storage, and power dispatch under fluctuating environmental conditions.

Implement C++ code to simulate the wind farmâ€™s operational dynamics and demonstrate the effectiveness of the MPC in managing real-time power generation and distribution.

ðŸŸ¥ Tï¼ˆTaskï¼‰

Implement a model predictive control (MPC) system in C++ to optimize the operation of a wind farm under variable environmental conditions.

ðŸŸ© Aï¼ˆActionï¼‰

Develop a simulation of the wind farmâ€™s operational dynamics, including wind speed fluctuations, turbine response, and energy storage behavior. Use this model to implement an MPC algorithm that predicts system states and adjusts control inputs to maximize power output efficiency, manage storage, and maintain grid stabilityâ€”all while respecting operational constraints.

ðŸŸ¦ Gï¼ˆGoalï¼‰

Ensure the wind farm delivers stable, efficient, and adaptive energy generation under real-time, fluctuating conditionsâ€”outperforming traditional control methods in both responsiveness and sustainability.
