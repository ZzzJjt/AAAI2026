### Intent:
**Intent Summary:**  
Create a structured control narrative for an ammonium nitrate reactor, specifying process parameters, instrumentation, operational sequences, and safety interlocks to ensure safe and efficient production.  

*(For code generation: Focus on translating the defined setpoints, control loops, and interlock logic into programmable automation code.)*

### Prompt:
**Control Narrative for Ammonium Nitrate Reactor**

**R-T-F:**

ðŸŸ¥ R (Role) â€“ Define Your Role

Act as a process control engineer developing a formal control narrative for a reactor producing ammonium nitrate, intended for automation system configuration, safety documentation, and operator reference.

â¸»

ðŸŸ© T (Task) â€“ Define the Objective

Draft a control narrative that:
	â€¢	Describes the process purpose and operating principles of the ammonium nitrate reactor
	â€¢	Specifies key process parameters with setpoints and acceptable ranges (e.g., temperature, pressure, pH, flow ratios)
	â€¢	Details the required instrumentation and control equipment, including control loops (e.g., TIC, PIC, FIC), sensors, and valves
	â€¢	Outlines the sequence of operation for startup, normal operation, and shutdown
	â€¢	Includes interlock conditions and alarm logic to ensure safe and stable operation

â¸»

ðŸŸ§ F (Format) â€“ Specify the Output Format

Structure the control narrative as follows:
	1.	Process Overview
	â€¢	Purpose: Neutralize nitric acid with ammonia to produce ammonium nitrate
	â€¢	Reactor Type: Continuous Stirred Tank Reactor (CSTR)
	â€¢	Normal flow conditions and operational limits
	2.	Key Setpoints and Ranges
	â€¢	Temperature (TIC-101): 175â€¯Â°C Â± 2â€¯Â°C
	â€¢	Pressure (PIC-102): 4.8â€¯bar Â± 0.2â€¯bar
	â€¢	Ammonia:Acid Ratio (FRC-103): 1.01:1
	â€¢	pH Control (AIC-105): Target = 6.2, acceptable range = 5.8â€“6.5
	3.	Instrumentation and Equipment
	â€¢	Flow transmitters (FIC-103, FIC-104), pH analyzer (AIC-105)
	â€¢	Safety interlocks: high-pressure switch, high-temperature alarm, emergency shutoff valve (ESD-106)
	4.	Sequence of Operation
	â€¢	Startup: Initialize controllers, ramp up feed flows, preheat reactor, activate ratio and pH control
	â€¢	Steady-State: Maintain PID loops, monitor deviation alarms, and log key values
	â€¢	Shutdown: Isolate feeds, depressurize, stop heating, drain reactor contents
	5.	Interlocks and Alarms
	â€¢	Temperature > 185â€¯Â°C â†’ emergency shutdown
	â€¢	Pressure > 5.2â€¯bar â†’ close feed valves
	â€¢	pH < 5.5 â†’ alarm + reduce ammonia flow

**Notes:**

1.	This control narrative is a high-level guide for the design of an ammonium nitrate reactor control system. It is essential to consult the specific process design, safety regulations, and equipment specifications to ensure a safe and efficient control system.

2.	The control narrative should be reviewed and approved by the process engineer, safety engineer, and automation engineer before implementation.

3.	The control narrative should be integrated with the automation system's programming code, which will translate the control logic into executable instructions for the control valves, heaters, and other equipment.

4.	The control narrative should be easily accessible to operators for reference during normal operation and troubleshooting.

5.	The control narrative should be periodically reviewed and updated to reflect any changes in the process, equipment, or operating conditions.
