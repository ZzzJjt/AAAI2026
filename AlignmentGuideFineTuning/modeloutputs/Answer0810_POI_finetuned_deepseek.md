### Intent:
Develop a Model Predictive Control (MPC) system for wind farm power optimization that adjusts turbine blade pitch angles to maintain stable grid power output while managing energy storage constraints.

### Prompt:
**Statistical Process Control for Steel Manufacturing Using Python:**

Develop Python code to implement a statistical process control (SPC) system for monitoring and optimizing the quality of steel manufacturing processes. The code should track key quality metrics such as tensile strength, thickness, and surface finish in real-time, using control charts and other SPC tools to detect and respond to process variations. Implement alarms for out-of-control conditions, and suggest corrective actions to minimize defects and ensure product consistency.

Simulate the steel manufacturing process, and demonstrate how SPC can be used to maintain high-quality production standards while minimizing waste and process variability.

**T-A-G:**

ðŸŸ¥ Tï¼ˆTaskï¼‰

Create a Python-based statistical process control (SPC) system to monitor and improve quality in steel manufacturing.

ðŸŸ© Aï¼ˆActionï¼‰

Simulate key quality metrics such as tensile strength, thickness, and surface finish in real time. Implement SPC tools including XÌ„ and R charts to detect process deviations, trigger alarms for out-of-control conditions, and recommend corrective actions to minimize defects and maintain consistency.

ðŸŸ¦ Gï¼ˆGoalï¼‰

Ensure high product quality, reduce waste, and maintain process stability by enabling early detection and response to quality variations through a data-driven, real-time control system.
