### Intent:
**Intent Summary:**  
Create a Structured Text function block to dynamically register/deregister CANOpen PDOs (Process Data Objects) or Layer 2 messages, with options to clear all registrations and buffer data, while ensuring robust error handling and network stability.  

*(Focus: CANOpen PDO management via ST, runtime flexibility, and safety.)*

### Prompt:
**CANOpen PDO Registration Using 61131-3 Structured Text:**

Develop a structured text (ST) function block named CAN_REGISTER_COBID based on IEC 61131 standards. The block will be responsible for registering or deleting a PDO (Process Data Object) or CAN Layer 2 message for reception by the network layer. When the REGISTER input is set to TRUE, the specified COBID (CAN identifier) will be registered for receiving messages. If REGISTER is set to FALSE, the registration of the respective COBID will be deleted. Additionally, when REGISTER is FALSE and COBID is set to 0, all registrations and messages stored in the network layer buffer will be cleared. Discuss the function blockâ€™s implementation, including error handling, network communication management, and memory buffer clearing mechanisms.

ðŸŸ¥ T (Task) â€“ What You Need to Do

Design a Structured Text (ST) function block named CAN_REGISTER_COBID using the IEC 61131-3 standard to manage registration and deregistration of PDOs or CAN Layer 2 messages in a CANOpen network.

ðŸŸ© A (Action) â€“ How to Do It

Implement logic so that when REGISTER = TRUE, the function block registers the specified COBID for receiving messages. When REGISTER = FALSE, it removes the registration. If REGISTER = FALSE and COBID = 0, the function block should clear all registrations and network buffer data. Include robust error handling, communication status checks, and safe memory buffer management within the function block.

ðŸŸ¦ G (Goal) â€“ What Success Looks Like

Enable dynamic and reliable management of CANOpen message registrations during runtime, ensuring communication stability, flexibility, and system safety across changing operational requirements.

ðŸŸ¦ G (Goal) â€“ What Success Looks Like

Enable dynamic and reliable management of CANOpen message registrations during runtime, ensuring communication stability, flexibility, and system safety across changing operational requirements. The function block should be able to handle various error scenarios, such as network communication failures, buffer overflow, and memory allocation issues.

**CAN_REGISTER_COBID Function Block Implementation:**

1. **Input Parameters:**
   - **REGISTER**: A Boolean input that indicates whether to register (TRUE) or deregister (FALSE) a COBID.
   - **COBID**: A 32-bit unsigned integer input that specifies the CAN identifier to be registered or deregistered.
   - **BUFFER_SIZE**: An optional input that defines the maximum size of the network buffer. If not provided, the function block should use a default buffer size.

2. **Output Parameters:**
   - **STATUS**: A Boolean output that indicates the status of the registration or deregistration process. TRUE if successful, FALSE if an error occurred.
   - **ERROR**: A string output that provides information about the error, if any.

3. **Function Block Implementation:**

   - **Step 1:** Check the input parameters for validity.
     - Verify that REGISTER is a Boolean value.
     - Verify that COBID is a 32-bit unsigned integer.
     - Verify that BUFFER_SIZE is an optional input or a default value is provided.

   - **Step 2:** Handle the registration or deregistration process.
     - If REGISTER = TRUE, register the specified COBID for receiving messages.
     - If REGISTER = FALSE, deregister the specified COBID.
     - If REGISTER = FALSE and COBID = 0, clear all registrations and network buffer data.

   - **Step 3:** Handle error scenarios.
     - If any input parameter is invalid, set ERROR to an appropriate error message and STATUS to FALSE.
     - If network communication fails, set ERROR to "Network communication error" and STATUS to FALSE.
     - If buffer overflow occurs, set ERROR to "Buffer overflow" and STATUS to FALSE.
     - If memory allocation fails, set ERROR to "Memory allocation error" and STATUS to FALSE.

   - **Step 4:** Return the registration status and error information.
     - Set the STATUS output to TRUE if the registration or deregistration process was successful.
     - Set the ERROR output to an empty string if no error occurred.
