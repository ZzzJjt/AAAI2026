**C**ontext ❯❯❯

Wind farms must balance power generation with grid stability and efficiency under variable environmental conditions. Traditional control methods may struggle to adapt to sudden changes in wind speed or turbine performance. Model predictive control (MPC) can help by optimizing power output and storage in real-time, ensuring stable energy delivery while maximizing efficiency.
