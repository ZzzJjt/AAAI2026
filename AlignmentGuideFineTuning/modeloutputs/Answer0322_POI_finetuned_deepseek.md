In a water treatment plant, a PID block can be used to control the chlorine dosing pump:
// Inputs
SP := 3.0; // Desired chlorine concentration (ppm)
PV := MeasuredChlorine(); // Real-time sensor input
Kp := 1.2;
Ki := 0.5;
Kd := 0.0;

// Output
OUT := PID(SP, PV, Kp, Ki, Kd); // Dosing rate output
The OUT value is used to control the speed of a pump that adds chlorine to the water stream. If the actual concentration drops below 3 ppm, the PID will increase the output accordingly.

# PID Function Block in OSCAT Library

## Overview

The PID function block in the OSCAT library is a powerful control block that implements the Proportional-Integral-Derivative (PID) algorithm for real-time process control. It is designed to handle dynamic systems with varying input and output ranges, and it can be configured to operate in manual or automatic modes. The block includes configurable tuning parameters for Kp, Ki, and Kd, as well as input and output limits to ensure safe and stable operation.

## Inputs

### PV (Process Variable)

The Process Variable (PV) input represents the measured or setpoint value that the PID block is controlling. This can be a temperature, pressure, flow rate, or any other process variable that needs to be maintained within a specified range.

### SP (Setpoint)

The Setpoint (SP) input represents the desired or target value for the process variable. This value is used to compare the measured value with the setpoint and determine the control action.

### Kp, Ki, and Kd

The Kp, Ki, and Kd inputs are the proportional, integral, and derivative tuning parameters, respectively. These values are used to adjust the control action based on the error between the setpoint and the measured value.

### Manual, AUTO, and Manual Override

The Manual, AUTO, and Manual Override inputs control the operation mode of the PID block.

- Manual: The block operates in manual mode, where the control action is set manually by the user.
- AUTO: The block operates in automatic mode, where it adjusts the control action based on the error between the setpoint and the measured value.
- Manual Override: The block overrides the automatic control and operates in manual mode.

## Internal Behavior

When the block is triggered, it calculates the error between the setpoint and the measured value, and then adjusts the control action based on the tuning parameters. The block also includes clamping logic to ensure that the control output is within safe limits.

### Error Calculation

The block calculates the error between the setpoint and the measured value using the formula:

Error := SP - PV

### Control Action

The control action is calculated using the PID formula:

OUT := Kp * Error + Ki * integral + Kd * (derivative)

The integral term accumulates the past error over time
