### Intent:
"Generate a NORSOK-compliant textual System Control Diagram (SCD) for an LNG vaporizer system, including instrumentation tags, control loops, interlocks, and piping flow, structured for functional specification and safety compliance."

### Prompt:
**SCD LNG Vaporizer:**

Create a NORSOK system control diagram (SCD) in textual notation for a LNG Vaporizer System. Include instrumentation, control loops, and interlocks. Provide concrete tag numbers and piping.

**R-I-S-E:**

ðŸŸ¥ R (Role) â€“ Define Your Role

Act as a control and instrumentation engineer tasked with developing a text-based System Control Diagram (SCD) for an LNG vaporizer system in compliance with NORSOK standards.

ðŸŸ© I (Input) â€“ Information Provided

You are to document the LNG vaporization process, including:
	â€¢	Process flow from LNG inlet to gas outlet
	â€¢	Instrumentation with tag numbers (e.g., FT201, TT101, TIC101, FCV201)
	â€¢	Control loops (e.g., temperature and flow control)
	â€¢	Interlocks and shutdown logic (e.g., high-pressure trip to ESD)
	â€¢	Clear piping flow indication using arrows (-->)

The diagram must be presented in plain text format, structured for readability and system logic clarity.

ðŸŸ§ S (Steps) â€“ Steps to Perform
	1.	Identify the main process path:
LNG Inlet â†’ Flow Control â†’ Vaporizer â†’ Gas Outlet
	2.	Insert instrumentation and control loops along the flow path:
	â€¢	Flow loop: FT201 â†’ FIC201 â†’ FCV201
	â€¢	Temperature loop: TT101 â†’ TIC101 â†’ TCV101
	3.	Add interlock logic where necessary:
	â€¢	Pressure trip: PSH301 â†’ ESD1 (Shutdown TCV101)
	â€¢	Temperature trip: TSH302 â†’ ESD2 (Block LNG Inlet)
	4.	Format the diagram using indentation and directional arrows, grouping related logic under control loop or safety headings.

ðŸŸ¦ E (Expectation) â€“ Expected Outcome

The result will be a structured, NORSOK-style textual SCD for the LNG vaporizer system that can be used for:
	â€¢	Functional specification of the control system
	â€¢	Engineering reviews
	â€¢	DCS/PLC logic design
	â€¢	Safety documentation and compliance verification
