### Intent:
**Intent Summary:**  
Create a detailed control narrative for an ammonium nitrate reactor, specifying setpoints, instrumentation, and control logic to ensure safe and efficient operation, including temperature, pressure, flow ratio, and pH regulation with interlocks for deviations.  

*(For code generation: Focus on translating defined setpoints, PID loops, and safety interlocks into programmable logic for reactor automation.)*

### Prompt:
**Control Narrative for Ammonium Nitrate Reactor**

Create a control narrative for a reactor producing ammonium nitrates including concrete setpoints and ranges.

**B-A-B:**

ðŸŸ¥ B (Before) â€“ The Problem or Challenge

In the production of ammonium nitrate, the reactor stage is critical for maintaining safety, product quality, and process efficiency. However, without a clearly defined control narrativeâ€”including setpoints, ranges, and instrumentationâ€”operators and control systems risk process instability, inefficient reactions, or unsafe operating conditions. Generic documentation often lacks the precision needed for automation or regulatory compliance.

Develop a comprehensive control narrative for the ammonium nitrate reactor, including:
	â€¢	Concrete setpoints and control ranges for key parameters such as:
	â€¢	Reaction temperature (e.g., 170â€“180â€¯Â°C)
	â€¢	Reactor pressure (e.g., 4.5â€“5.0â€¯bar)
	â€¢	Ammonia-to-nitric acid ratio
	â€¢	pH control

	â€¢	Description of control logic and interlocks for normal operation and safety shutdowns

(* 1. Process Overview *)

The ammonium nitrate reactor is a continuous stirred-tank reactor (CSTR) that neutralizes nitric acid with ammonia. The process is controlled using a PID loop for temperature, pressure, and flow ratio, and pH control is achieved through a separate loop. The reactor is equipped with instrumentation such as temperature sensors, pressure transmitters, flow meters, and pH analyzers.
