🟥 R (Role) – Your Role

You are a PLC software developer or control systems engineer responsible for implementing a mathematical function block to compute eigenvalues of a 10×10 matrix using IEC 61131-3 Structured Text, optimized for use in real-time automation environments.

⸻

🟩 I (Input) – What You’re Given

You need to design a function block that:
	•	Accepts a 10×10 REAL matrix as input
	•	Computes and outputs the eigenvalues in a 10-element REAL array
	•	Includes comments explaining the algorithm steps (e.g., normalization, iteration, convergence check)
	•	Handles limitations related to:
	•	Numerical stability (e.g., rounding errors, floating-point limits)
	•	Convergence of iterative algorithms
	•	Execution time and performance in PLC environments

⸻

🟧 S (Steps) – What You Need to Do
	1.	Choose an appropriate algorithm (e.g., Power Iteration or a simplified QR method) suited for a PLC’s processing capabilities
	2.	Create a function block structure with:
	•	Matrix input: MatrixInput : ARRAY[1..10, 1..10] OF REAL
	•	Eigenvalue output: EigenValues : ARRAY[1..10] OF REAL
	3.	Implement the core logic:
	•	Initialize a vector
	•	Perform matrix-vector multiplication
	•	Normalize the vector
	•	Estimate the dominant eigenvalue
	•	Repeat with convergence threshold or iteration limit
	4.	Include detailed inline comments explaining:
	•	Each step’s mathematical purpose
	•	How you ensure convergence
	•	How fail-safes are built in for real-time performance
	5.	Optionally: create a fallback output or diagnostic flag if the algorithm doesn’t converge within a safe number of cycles

⸻

🟦 E (Expectation) – What Success Looks Like

You produce a modular, well-documented function block that can be integrated into PLC projects needing matrix analysis—especially useful in model-based control, signal processing, or system diagnostics. The function block:
	•	Provides reasonably accurate eigenvalues under PLC constraints
	•	Performs reliably within execution cycle time limits
	•	Fails safely and predictably if it detects instability or divergence
