**Structured Text (ST) Keyword Reference**

**Control Flow Structures:**

- IF: Conditional execution of code blocks based on a Boolean expression.
- CASE: Switch statement for multiple conditional cases.
- FOR: Iterative execution of a code block for a specified number of times.
- WHILE: Continuous execution of a code block while a Boolean condition is true.
- REPEAT: Iterative execution of a code block until a Boolean condition is true.

**Standard Functions:**

- TON: Timer on, starts a timer with a specified duration.
- CTU: Counter up, increments a counter by a specified value.
- ABS: Absolute value, returns the absolute value of a number.
- SQR: Square root, calculates the square root of a number.
- SGN: Sign, returns the sign
