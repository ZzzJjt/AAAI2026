	â€¢	0x10: Write Multiple Registers
	â€¢	0x17: Read/Write Multiple Registers

In addition, describe the ReadCoils method, explaining how it processes client requests, maps coil data, and manages communication over TCP/IP.

ðŸŸ¨ S (Scoring) â€“ How We'll Score Your Solution

Your solution will be evaluated based on the following criteria:

	â€¢	Compliance with the Modbus TCP protocol and IEC 61131-3 Structured Text
	â€¢	Functionality and support for the specified Modbus function codes
	â€¢	Concurrency and parallel client handling
	â€¢	Reliability and robustness of TCP/IP communication
	â€¢	Code quality, maintainability, and scalability

**Modbus Server Function Block:**

The Modbus server function block should be self-contained and capable of handling up to 10 concurrent Modbus TCP client connections. It should support the following Modbus function codes:

	â€¢	0x01: Read Coils
	â€¢	0x02: Read Discrete Inputs
	â€¢	0x03: Read Holding Registers
	â€¢	0x04: Read Input Registers
	â€¢	0x05: Write Single Coil
	â€¢	0x06: Write Single Register
	â€¢	0x0F: Write Multiple Coils
	â€¢	0x10: Write Multiple Registers
	â€¢	0x17: Read/Write Multiple Registers

The ReadCoils method should be implemented to handle client requests, map coil data, and manage communication over TCP/IP. It should include the following steps:

1. **Parsing Client Requests:** The server should receive and parse Modbus TCP frames, extracting the function code, address, and quantity of coils to read.

2. **Mapping Coil Data:** The server should map the coil addresses to the internal coil data structure, ensuring that the requested coils are within the valid range.

3. **Handling TCP/IP Communication:** The server should manage the TCP/IP connection, including establishing the connection, sending and receiving frames, and closing the connection when finished.

4. **Formatting Responses:** The server should construct the Modbus TCP response frame, including the function code, address, quantity, and coil data, and send it back to the client.

5. **Error Handling:** The server should handle any errors or exceptions that may occur during the process, such as invalid function codes, out-of-range addresses, or communication failures.

6. **Timeout Detection:** The server should implement a timeout mechanism to detect and handle idle or disconnected clients, ensuring that the server does not wait indefinitely for a response.
