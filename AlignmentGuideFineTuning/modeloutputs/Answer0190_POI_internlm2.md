### Intent:
The task is to create a detailed control narrative for the fermentation stage of ethanol production, specifying automation logic, setpoints, instrumentation, and safety interlocks to guide PLC programming and process operation.

### Prompt:
**SFC Traffic Light:**

Create a 61131-3 sequential function chart in ASCII art for a traffic light. Include proper delays for switching the lights.

**B-A-B:**

ðŸŸ¥ B (Before) â€“ The Problem or Challenge

When designing a traffic light control system using IEC 61131-3, itâ€™s important to clearly represent the sequential logic of light transitions (green â†’ yellow â†’ red â†’ green) with appropriate timing delays. In situations where graphical tools are not availableâ€”such as for documentation, version control, or early-stage logic planningâ€”engineers need a way to express Sequential Function Charts (SFCs) using plain-text or ASCII art. Without a structured textual layout, the sequence flow and timing logic can become confusing or miscommunicated.

â¸»

ðŸŸ© A (After) â€“ The Desired Outcome

Create a Sequential Function Chart (SFC) in ASCII art that models the behavior of a standard traffic light system. The chart should:
	â€¢	Follow IEC 61131-3 syntax and logic structure
	â€¢	Include steps for Green, Yellow, and Red lights
	â€¢	Use transitions between steps with clear conditions
	â€¢	Implement delays/timers between transitions (e.g., 5s green, 2s yellow, 5s red)
	â€¢	Be clearly formatted to show the flow from one step to the next in a loop

ðŸŸ§ B (Bridge) â€“ How to Get There
	1.	Define three steps: S1: Green, S2: Yellow, S3: Red
	2.	Place transitions between steps with timing conditions such as T#5s or tGreen.Q
	3.	Format the diagram using ASCII blocks for clarity, for example:

 +------------+     tGreen.Q     +-------------+     tYellow.Q     +-----------+
| Green Light|---------------->| Yellow Light|------------------>| Red Light |
|  TON: tGreen                  |  TON: tYellow                 |  TON: tRed |
+------------+                 +-------------+                 +-----------+
        ^                                                                 |
        |                                                                 |
        +-----------------------------------------------------------------+
                         tRed.Q (after 5s)

### Generated Code:

**Ethanol Production:**

ðŸŸ¥ B (Before) â€“ The Problem or Challenge

In the fermentation stage of ethanol production, there are several critical parameters that need to be monitored and controlled to ensure the process runs smoothly and efficiently. These parameters include temperature, pH, dissolved oxygen, and nutrient levels. Any deviation from the setpoints can lead to suboptimal fermentation, reduced yield, or even process failure.

â¸»

ðŸŸ© A (After) â€“ The Desired Outcome

The fermentation stage of ethanol production should be automated using a Programmable Logic Controller (PLC) with the following features:

1. **Automation Logic:**
	* Temperature control: Maintain a constant temperature within the fermentation vessel using a PID controller.
	* pH control: Maintain a desired pH level using a pH controller.
	* Dissolved oxygen control: Monitor and control the dissolved oxygen level to ensure optimal fermentation.
	* Nutrient control: Automatically feed nutrients to the fermentation vessel as needed.
2. **Setpoints:**
