### Intent:
**Intent Summary:**  
Create a structured text program to control a pneumatic system by maintaining a 50 SLPM flow rate and 5.5â€“6 bar pressure, with safety checks for deviations, executing deterministically every 100 ms.

### Prompt:
**Pneumatic System Control Using 61131-3 Structured Text:**

Write a self-contained 61131-3 structured text program (not a function block) to control a pneumatic system with a control loop frequency of 100 ms. The system should regulate the flow of air to actuators based on input signals, maintaining a flow rate of 50 standard liters per minute. The system must also ensure that the pressure remains within the specified range of 5.5 to 6 bar. Implement safety checks to handle any deviations in flow or pressure and ensure efficient and reliable operation under varying load conditions.

**R-I-S-E:**

ðŸŸ¥ R (Role) â€“ Your Role

You are a PLC control engineer tasked with designing a Structured Text (ST) program compliant with IEC 61131-3 standards to control a pneumatic system. Your goal is to ensure stable airflow, safe pressure regulation, and reliable real-time response under varying load conditions.

â¸»

ðŸŸ© I (Input) â€“ What Youâ€™re Given
	â€¢	Control loop frequency: 100 ms (program should update every 0.1 seconds)
	â€¢	Target flow rate: 50 standard liters per minute (SLPM)
	â€¢	Pressure operating range: 5.5 to 6.0 bar
	â€¢	Sensor inputs:
	â€¢	FlowInput (REAL): Current flow rate
	â€¢	PressureInput (REAL): Current pressure
	â€¢	Actuator outputs:
	â€¢	FlowValveOutput (BOOL): Controls air valve
	â€¢	PressureReliefValve (BOOL): Activates if pressure is out of bounds
	â€¢	Safety conditions:
	â€¢	Trigger alerts or actuator shutdowns if pressure or flow deviate from desired range

â¸»

ðŸŸ§ S (Steps) â€“ What You Need to Do
	1.	Calculate Flow Control Logic:
	â€¢	If FlowInput < 50.0 SLPM, open FlowValveOutput
	â€¢	Else, close it to maintain or reduce flow
	2.	Check Pressure Safety Range:
	â€¢	If PressureInput < 5.5 bar or > 6.0 bar, set PressureError := TRUE and open PressureReliefValve
	â€¢	Otherwise, keep valve closed and clear the fault flag
	3.	Monitor Flow Deviation:
	â€¢	If ABS(FlowInput - FlowSetpoint) > 5.0, raise FlowError := TRUE
	â€¢	Else, set FlowError := FALSE
	4.	Ensure program executes deterministically within 100 ms cycle time
	â€¢	Avoid excessive computation or nested delays

â¸»

ðŸŸ¦ E (Expectation) â€“ What Success Looks Like

Your final program will:
	â€¢	Stably regulate flow around 50 SLPM
	â€¢	Protect equipment by responding to over/under-pressure events
	â€¢	Set FlowError and PressureError flags for diagnostics and alarming
	â€¢	Be modular, clear, and suitable for use in real-time industrial automation
	â€¢	Allow for future upgrades like PID control, data logging, or remote HMI integration
