üü• R (Role) ‚Äì Your Role

You are a PLC software developer or control systems engineer responsible for implementing a mathematical function block to compute eigenvalues of a 10√ó10 matrix using IEC 61131-3 Structured Text, optimized for use in real-time automation environments.

üü© I (Input) ‚Äì What You‚Äôre Given

You need to design a function block that:
	‚Ä¢	Accepts a 10√ó10 REAL matrix as input
	‚Ä¢	Computes and outputs the eigenvalues in a 10-element REAL array
	‚Ä¢	Includes comments explaining the algorithm steps (e.g., normalization, iteration, convergence check)
	‚Ä¢	Handles limitations related to:
	‚Ä¢	Numerical stability (e.g., rounding errors, floating-point limits)
	‚Ä¢	Convergence of iterative algorithms
	‚Ä¢	Execution time and performance in PLC environments

‚∏ª

üüß S (Steps) ‚Äì What You Need to Do
	1.	Choose an appropriate algorithm (e.g., Power Iteration or a simplified QR method) suited for a PLC‚Äôs processing capabilities
	2.	Create a function block structure with:
	‚Ä¢	Matrix input: MatrixInput : ARRAY[1..10, 1..10] OF REAL
	‚Ä¢	Eigenvalue output: EigenValues : ARRAY[1..10] OF REAL
	3.	Implement the core logic:
	‚Ä¢	Initialize a vector
	‚Ä¢	Perform matrix-vector multiplication
	‚Ä¢	Normalize the vector
	‚Ä¢	Estimate the dominant eigenvalue
	‚Ä¢	Repeat with convergence threshold or iteration limit
	4.	Include detailed inline comments explaining:
	‚Ä¢	Each step‚Äôs mathematical purpose
	‚Ä¢	How you ensure convergence
	‚Ä¢	How fail-safes are built in for real-time performance
	5.	Optionally: create a fallback output or diagnostic flag if the algorithm doesn‚Äôt converge within a safe number of cycles

‚∏ª

üü¶ E (Expectation) ‚Äì What Success Looks Like

You produce a modular, well-documented function block that can be integrated into PLC projects needing matrix analysis‚Äîespecially useful in model-based control, signal processing, or system diagnostics. The function block:
	‚Ä¢	Provides reasonably accurate eigenvalues under PLC constraints
	‚Ä¢	Performs reliably within execution cycle time limits
	‚Ä¢	Fails safely and predictably if it detects instability or divergence
