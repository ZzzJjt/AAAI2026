In a tank level control system, use the PID block to control a pump:
SP := 80.0; // Desired level (cm)
PV := ReadLevelSensor(); // Real-time level measurement

Ki := 0.2;
Kd := 0.05;

OUT := PID(SP, PV, Kp, Ki, Kd); // Control signal sent to pump speed

SP := 80.0; // Desired level (cm)
PV := ReadLevelSensor(); // Real-time level measurement
Kp := 1.0;
Ki := 0.2;
Kd := 0.05;

OUT := PID(SP, PV, Kp, Ki, Kd); // Control signal sent to pump speed controller
LIMIT_HI := 90.0; // Maximum level (cm)
LIMIT_LO := 70.0; // Minimum level (cm)

If the tank level is below 70 cm, the pump will run at a higher speed to increase the level. When the level reaches 80 cm, the pump will slow down to maintain the level. If the level exceeds 90 cm, the pump will stop to prevent overflow.

🔧 Parameter Explanation:

🔹 Kp (Proportional Gain) – Determines the magnitude of the control signal in response to the error. Higher values result in more aggressive control, but can lead to overshoot and instability.

🔹 Ki (Integral Gain) – Accumulates the error over time and adds it to the control signal. This helps to eliminate steady-state errors and improve system stability. However, excessive Ki can cause oscillations.

🔹 Kd (Derivative Gain) – Measures the rate of change of the error and adjusts the control signal accordingly. This helps to reduce overshoot and improve system response time. However, too much Kd can cause instability.

🔹 SP (Setpoint) – The desired target value for the process variable. This is the reference point against which the actual value (PV) is compared.

🔹 PV (Process Variable) – The current measured value of the process being controlled. This is the actual value that the control system is trying to match with the setpoint.

🔹 LIMIT_HI/LIMIT_LO – Optional upper and lower bounds for the control output. This prevents the system from going beyond a certain range, which can be useful for safety or process constraints.

🔹 MANUAL – Optional input to enable manual override of the control signal. This can be useful for maintenance or when the automatic control is not sufficient.

🔧 Tuning Tips:

1. **Start with a simple configuration**: Begin with a basic PID setup (Kp, Ki, Kd) and gradually adjust the parameters to achieve the desired response.
2. **Use a step response test**: Apply a step input to the system and observe the response. Adjust the PID parameters to minimize overshoot and settling time.
3. **Consider the process dynamics**: Understand the natural response of the process and adjust the PID parameters accordingly. For example, a slow process may
