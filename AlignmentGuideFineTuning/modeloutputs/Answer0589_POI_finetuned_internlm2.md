â¸»

ðŸŸ© I (Input)

You are provided with a task to compile a complete programming reference for Structured Text, which should include:
	â€¢	All valid keywords, such as control flow commands (IF, CASE, FOR, etc.)
	â€¢	All standard data types (BOOL, INT, REAL, TIME, etc.)
	â€¢	Commonly used function blocks (TON, CTU, TP, etc.)
	â€¢	A selection of code snippets demonstrating typical usage

This reference is meant to support development, debugging, and learning across various automation projects.

â¸»

ðŸŸ§ S (Steps)
	1.	Identify and list all reserved keywords from the IEC 61131-3 standard.
	2.	Categorize keywords by type:
	â€¢	Control flow (e.g., IF, WHILE, REPEAT)
	â€¢	Data types (e.g., REAL, STRING, TIME)
	â€¢	Constants and operators (e.g., TRUE, FALSE, AND, MOD)
	3.	Include key standard functions and function blocks with:
	â€¢	Descriptions of their purpose
	â€¢	Required inputs and outputs
	â€¢	Syntax and example usage
	4.	Format the reference as a developer-friendly guide:
	â€¢	Alphabetical list or categorized table
	â€¢	Code blocks for clarity
	â€¢	Annotations or tooltips for explanation

â¸»

ðŸŸ¦ E (Expectation)

Deliver a comprehensive and readable reference guide that:
	â€¢	Serves as a quick lookup tool for developers writing or reviewing Structured Text code
	â€¢	Supports learning and onboarding of new team members
	â€¢	Helps ensure coding consistency and standards compliance across projects
	â€¢	Can be exported as a PDF, embedded in an IDE, or hosted on a wiki/intranet site
