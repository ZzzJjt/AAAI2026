### Intent:
**Intent Summary:**  
Develop an IEC 61131-3 Structured Text program to safely execute a controlled shutdown of a steel production facility, including gradual fuel gas reduction over 12 hours, dynamic oxygen supply adjustment (1:2.5 ratio), and precise temperature control, with modular functions and safety interlocks.

### Prompt:
**Shutdown Steel Production:**

Develop a comprehensive list of steps for the controlled shutdown of a steel production facility. Include key stages such as reducing furnace temperature, controlling gas flow rates, and maintaining safe oxygen levels throughout the shutdown process.

Provide a detailed control narrative for steps 4 to 6 of the shutdown sequence, specifying concrete ranges and setpoints for variables such as temperature, gas flow, and oxygen levels.

Write a self-contained IEC 61131-3 Structured Text program based on this control narrative, ensuring proper sequencing and safety protocols.

Additionally, create a function in IEC 61131-3 to gradually reduce the fuel gas flow rate to the furnace burners over a period of 12 hours. This function should incorporate timing and safety checks to ensure smooth transitions.

Lastly, write an IEC 61131-3 function for adjusting the oxygen supply to the burners to maintain a precise fuel-to-air ratio of 1:2.5 during the shutdown. Ensure the function is adaptable to fluctuations in gas flow and temperature, and include safeguards for maintaining combustion efficiency.

	1.	Define the overall shutdown sequence, with clearly labeled stages (e.g., Furnace Cooling, Gas Ramp-Down, Oxygen Adjustment).
	2.	Write a control narrative for steps 4–6, specifying exact setpoints such as:
	•	Target temperature: < 400°C
	•	Gas flow ramp: 100% to 0% over 12 hours
	•	Fuel-to-air ratio: 1:2.5, adjusted in real-time
	3.	Implement the Structured Text logic for the sequence using timers (TON), analog comparisons, and safety interlocks.
	4.	Create a function for linear flow reduction based on elapsed time.
	5.	Develop a second function that calculates and regulates the oxygen supply dynamically, including safety limits and alarms.
	6.	Add comments and modular code structure for clarity and ease of maintenance.
