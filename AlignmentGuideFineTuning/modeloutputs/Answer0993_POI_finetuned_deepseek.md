### Intent:
**Intent Summary:**  
Develop a structured control narrative for ethanol fermentation, specifying setpoints, control methods, and safety logic for key parameters (temperature, pH, agitation, foam) to ensure stable, high-yield production.  

*(Focused on automation-ready details for fermentation phase control.)*

### Prompt:
**Control Narrative for Ethanol Production**

Create a control narrative for ethanol production including concrete setpoints and ranges.

Create a detailed explanation of each control step during Fermentation. Create one paragraph per subsection in Section 3.

**T-A-G:**

ðŸŸ¥ T (Task)

Develop a control narrative for an ethanol production process, with emphasis on the fermentation phase, including all critical parameters and automation logic.

â¸»

ðŸŸ© A (Action)
	â€¢	Specify concrete setpoints and ranges for key fermentation variables such as temperature (e.g., 32â€“35â€¯Â°C), pH (e.g., 4.5â€“5.0), and agitation speed.
	â€¢	Break Section 3: Fermentation into logical subsections (e.g., 3.1 Inoculation, 3.2 Temperature Control, 3.3 pH Adjustment, 3.4 Agitation, 3.5 Foam Control).
	â€¢	For each subsection, write one paragraph that describes:
	â€¢	The control objective
	â€¢	Setpoints or control bands
	â€¢	The control method (e.g., PID, on/off logic)
	â€¢	Any feedback sensors, interlocks, or alarm thresholds used to ensure safe and stable operation

â¸»

ðŸŸ¦ G (Goal)

Deliver a structured, detailed, and implementation-ready control narrative that helps automation engineers, operators, and system integrators understand how the fermentation stage is controlled, why it matters, and how the system should respond to deviationsâ€”ensuring safe, high-yield ethanol production.
