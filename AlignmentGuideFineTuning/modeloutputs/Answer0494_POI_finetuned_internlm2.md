	2.	Implement the core Simplex method:
	â€¢	Initialize the Simplex tableau
	â€¢	Identify the pivot column and row
	â€¢	Perform row operations to update the tableau

	3.	Add inline comments to explain:
	â€¢	Mathematical steps (e.g., pivot logic, ratio tests)
	â€¢	Performance considerations (e.g., avoid recursion, use FOR loops)
	â€¢	Error-handling (e.g., division by zero, unbounded solutions)
