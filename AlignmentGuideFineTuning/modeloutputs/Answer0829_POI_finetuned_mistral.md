### Intent:
The task is to create an IEC 61131-3 structured text function block for managing CAN Open COB ID registrations and deregistrations, including error handling and status reporting.

### Prompt:
**Profibus DP Diagnostics Using 61131-3 Structured Text:**

Develop a self-contained 61131-3 structured text function block to read diagnostic data from a Profibus DP slave device. The function block should handle communication with the Profibus DP slave and retrieve diagnostic information such as device status, error codes, and communication health. Provide an explanation of the key steps in processing the diagnostic data, including request initiation, data retrieval, and error handling mechanisms.

**T-A-G:**

ðŸŸ¥ T (Task) â€“ What You Need to Do

Create a self-contained IEC 61131-3 Structured Text (ST) function block to retrieve diagnostic data from a Profibus DP slave device.

â¸»

ðŸŸ© A (Action) â€“ How to Do It

Design the function block to initiate a diagnostic request upon receiving a rising edge on an Execute input. Use the provided SlaveAddress to communicate with the target device and retrieve diagnostic data such as device status, error codes, and communication health. Implement timeout monitoring via a Timeout input and handle errors by setting output flags like Error and ErrorID. Parse the diagnostic response and expose structured outputs for use in control or monitoring logic.

Include the following interface:

Inputs:
	â€¢	Execute (BOOL)
	â€¢	SlaveAddress (BYTE)
	â€¢	Timeout (TIME)

Outputs:
	â€¢	Done (BOOL)
	â€¢	Busy (BOOL)
	â€¢	Error (BOOL)
	â€¢	ErrorID (DWORD)
	â€¢	Optional: parsed diagnostic fields (e.g., DeviceStatus, CommState)

â¸»

ðŸŸ¦ G (Goal) â€“ What You Want to Achieve

Enable real-time, programmatic access to Profibus DP diagnostic data from within a PLC environment. The function block should support proactive fault detection, streamline maintenance response, and improve overall communication reliability between the controller and field devices.
