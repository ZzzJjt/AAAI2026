🟥 R (Role) – Your Role

You are a PLC programmer or control systems engineer tasked with implementing an on-device linear programming solver using the Simplex method, optimized for real-time industrial environments through IEC 61131-3 Structured Text.

🟩 I (Input) – What You’re Given

You are required to build a function block called SimplexSolver that:
	•	Solves linear programming problems using the Simplex algorithm
	•	Accepts:
	•	An array for the objective function coefficients (e.g., C: ARRAY[1..N] OF REAL)
	•	A constraint matrix (e.g., A: ARRAY[1..M,1..N] OF REAL)
	•	A right-hand side array (B: ARRAY[1..M] OF REAL)
	•	Produces:
	•	An optimal solution vector (X: ARRAY[1..N] OF REAL)
	•	The optimal objective function value
	•	A status flag (e.g., solution found, infeasible, max iterations reached)
	•	Operates under PLC constraints, including fixed memory, bounded loop execution, and limited floating-point precision

⸻

🟧 S (Steps) – What You Need to Do
	1.	Define the function block interface with arrays sized for typical industrial applications (e.g., max 5 variables, 5 constraints).
	2.	Implement the core Simplex method:
	•	Initialize the Simplex tableau
	•	Identify the pivot column and row
	•	Perform row operations to update the tableau
	•	Repeat until optimality or iteration limit is reached
	3.	Add inline comments to explain:
	•	Mathematical steps (e.g., pivot logic, ratio tests)
	•	Performance considerations (e.g., avoid recursion, use FOR loops)
	•	Error-handling (e.g., division by zero, unbounded solutions)
	4.	Integrate safety and performance limits, including:
	•	Max iteration count
	•	Output flag for infeasibility
	•	Optional watchdog trigger or time-slicing logic

⸻

🟦 E (Expectation) – What Success Looks Like

You produce a modular, reusable function block that allows a PLC to perform basic linear optimization autonomously. The block:
	•	Handles small LP problems in real time
	•	Is documented and structured for clarity and maintainability
	•	Enables optimization tasks such as:
	•	Resource allocation
	•	Load distribution
	•	Blending/mixing ratios
	•	Provides deterministic outputs, supporting control system decision-making without relying on external solvers or cloud connectivity

**Example Use Case:**

A chemical plant needs to optimize the blending of raw materials to meet product specifications while minimizing costs. The SimplexSolver function block is used to determine the optimal blend ratios for the raw materials, ensuring the product meets quality standards and is cost-effective. The function block is integrated into the plant's control system, allowing for real-time adjustments to the blending process based on changing conditions or raw material availability.

**Limitations and Considerations:**

Implementing linear programming in a PLC environment comes with several limitations:
	•	Memory constraints: The function block must be designed to handle small-scale problems efficiently, with arrays sized for typical industrial applications.
	•	Processing power: The Simplex method can be computationally intensive, especially for larger problems. The function block must be optimized to minimize processing time and avoid unnecessary computations.
	•	Floating-point precision: PLCs typically have limited floating-point precision, which can affect the accuracy of the solution. The function block must be designed to handle this limitation and provide reliable results.
	•	Real-time performance: The function block must be able to solve problems in real time, without introducing significant delays or affecting the overall performance of the control system.
	•	Safety and reliability: The function block must be designed with safety and reliability in mind, ensuring that it can handle unexpected inputs or errors without compromising the integrity of the control system.

**Conclusion:**

Implementing a linear programming solver in a PLC environment using the Simplex method is a challenging task, but it can provide significant benefits for industrial optimization. By designing a modular, reusable function block that handles small-scale problems efficiently and provides reliable results, PLC programmers and control systems engineers can enable real-time optimization tasks such as resource allocation, load distribution, and blending ratios. While there are limitations to implementing linear programming in a PLC environment, careful design and optimization can help overcome these challenges and provide a valuable tool for industrial control systems.
