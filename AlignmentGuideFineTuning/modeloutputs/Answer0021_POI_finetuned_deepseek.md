### Intent:
**Intent Summary:**  
Create an IEC 61131-3 function block (`FB_CommMonitor`) to monitor the health of OPC UA, Modbus, and Profinet connections cyclically, trigger alarms on failures, log audit events, and manage protocol-specific state machines with configurable polling and timeout thresholds.  

*(Focus: Multi-protocol communication monitoring with fault detection, state tracking, and logging.)*

### Prompt:
**CANOpen PDO Registration Using 61131-3 Structured Text:**

Develop a structured text (ST) function block named CAN_REGISTER_COBID based on IEC 61131 standards. The block will be responsible for registering or deleting a PDO (Process Data Object) or CAN Layer 2 message for reception by the network layer. When the REGISTER input is set to TRUE, the specified COBID (CAN identifier) will be registered for receiving messages. If REGISTER is set to FALSE, the registration of the respective COBID will be deleted. Additionally, when REGISTER is FALSE and COBID is set to 0, all registrations and messages stored in the network layer buffer will be cleared. Discuss the function blockâ€™s implementation, including error handling, network communication management, and memory buffer clearing mechanisms.

**B-A-B:**

ðŸŸ¥ B (Before) â€“ The Challenge

In CANOpen-based industrial systems, managing the registration and deregistration of Process Data Objects (PDOs) or CAN Layer 2 messages can be complex and error-prone. Manual handling of COBID message reception lacks modularity, robust error handling, and efficient memory management, which increases the risk of communication issues and system instability.

ðŸŸ© A (After) â€“ The Ideal State

Create a reusable IEC 61131-3 Structured Text function block named CAN_REGISTER_COBID that reliably registers or deregisters specific COBIDs based on a boolean input. When REGISTER is set to TRUE, the specified COBID is registered to receive messages. When REGISTER is FALSE, the registration is removed. Furthermore, if REGISTER is FALSE and COBID equals 0, the function block clears all registered COBIDs and purges the network layer buffer. The block includes robust error handling, communication management, and memory buffer clearing capabilities.

ðŸŸ§ B (Bridge) â€“ The Solution Path

Implement the function block with well-defined inputs, outputs, and internal state management. Use logical conditions to handle registration, deregistration, and full reset operations. Integrate fault detection for invalid COBIDs, duplicate registrations, and network communication errors, returning appropriate status flags or error codes. This modular function block ensures reliable, safe, and dynamic PDO registration in CANOpen networks, improving system maintainability and communication robustness.
