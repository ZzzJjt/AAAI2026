### Intent:
The task is to implement a model predictive control (MPC) system in Python that optimizes continuous cellulose fiber production by managing material flow through a two-stage batch process with time delays and fluctuating demand, ensuring high buffer tank levels to prevent downstream disruptions.  

(Key elements: MPC, hybrid continuous-batch process, delay compensation, demand variability, tank level maintenance)

### Prompt:
**Model Predictive Control for Continuous Cellulose Fiber Production Using Python:**

Explain how model predictive control (MPC) can optimize cellulose fiber production from wood, where continuous infeed and outfeed operations are required, while the material undergoes a two-stage batch process. The material is supplied at an average rate of 50 tons per hour, undergoing pre-treatment in a reactor followed by homogenization before entering a 1,000 cubic meter buffer tank. The product is extracted from the tank on demand, not at a constant rate. To minimize downtime in downstream processes, a high fill level in the tank must be maintained, despite the two-hour delay caused by upstream batch processes, making PID control unsuitable.

Develop Python code to simulate the system dynamics, including the dead time and fluctuating demand.

Implement Python code for a model predictive control (MPC) algorithm to optimize material flow, taking into account the time delay, fluctuating demand, and operational constraints.

1. **Explanation of MPC's advantage over PID in handling delay and demand variability:**

Model predictive control (MPC) is a powerful optimization technique that can handle delay and demand variability better than traditional PID control. MPC uses a mathematical model of the system to predict future states and optimize the control input to achieve a desired objective. In contrast, PID control is a simple feedback control technique that adjusts the control input based on the difference between the current state and the desired state.

PID control is not suitable for systems with time delays and fluctuating demand because it cannot account for these disturbances in the control input. MPC, on the other hand, can account for these disturbances and adjust the control input accordingly to maintain the desired state.

2. **Python simulation model of the reactorâ€“homogenizerâ€“tank system:**

```python
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Define the system dynamics
def system_dynamics(state, time, inflow_rate, delay):
    inflow = inflow_rate * np.exp(-delay * time)
    state = np.dot(state, np.eye(state.shape[0]) - np.dot(state, state.T) * delay)
    return inflow - state

# Define the tank level constraint
def tank_level_constraint(state, time, inflow_rate, tank_capacity):
    tank_level = inflow_rate * time
    return tank_level - tank_capacity

# Define the objective function
def objective_function(state, time, inflow_rate, delay):
    return -state[-1]

# Define the MPC problem
