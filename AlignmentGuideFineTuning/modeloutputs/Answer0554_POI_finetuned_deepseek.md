### Intent:
**Intent Summary:**  
Develop an IEC 61131-3 Structured Text program for feedforward control in a chemical mixing process, proactively adjusting Reactant A's flow based on Reactant B's measured flow (and optional variables) to maintain a precise ratio, improving response time and reducing variability compared to feedback-only systems.  

*(Focus: Ratio-based feedforward control, real-time adjustment, industrial PLC deployment.)*

### Prompt:
**Feedforward Control Mixing:**

Develop a self-contained IEC 61131-3 Structured Text program (not a function block) to implement feedforward control for mixing two reactants in a chemical process. The program should predict the necessary adjustments to the flow rates of each reactant based on known disturbances or input changes, ensuring optimal mixing conditions.

Include logic that calculates the required feedforward adjustments based on process variables such as flow rates, concentration, and temperature, and ensure the control system can respond quickly to input changes without relying solely on feedback. Discuss the advantages of using feedforward control in mixing processes, particularly in terms of improving response time and reducing process variability compared to traditional feedback control.

**R-I-S-E:**

ðŸŸ¥ R (Role) â€“ Your Role

You are a control systems engineer tasked with developing a feedforward control strategy for a chemical mixing process using IEC 61131-3 Structured Text. Your responsibility is to ensure precise ratio-based mixing of two reactants under dynamic input conditions.

â¸»

ðŸŸ© I (Input) â€“ What Youâ€™re Given
	â€¢	A desired mixing ratio between Reactant A and Reactant B (e.g., 2:1)
	â€¢	Real-time inputs from upstream sensors:
	â€¢	Flow_B â€“ flow rate of Reactant B
	â€¢	Concentration_B and Temperature_B â€“ optional variables for dynamic compensation
	â€¢	A feedforward control principle that adjusts the flow of Reactant A based on expected disturbances, rather than waiting for a feedback correction

â¸»

ðŸŸ§ S (Steps) â€“ What You Need to Do
	1.	Define control variables for the mixing ratio and flow inputs.
	2.	Calculate Reactant Aâ€™s required flow rate using the formula:
	â€¢	Flow_A_Setpoint := Desired_Ratio * Flow_B * Compensation_Factor
	3.	Include optional logic to adjust the Compensation_Factor based on temperature or concentration if needed.
	4.	Output the computed setpoint for use in the control of the Reactant A flow valve or pump.

â¸»

ðŸŸ¦ E (Expectation) â€“ What Success Looks Like

The completed program should:
	â€¢	Proactively adjust Reactant Aâ€™s flow in real time as Reactant Bâ€™s properties change
	â€¢	Maintain a stable and accurate reactant ratio, even under varying upstream conditions
	â€¢	Deliver faster response and reduced variability compared to feedback-only systems
	â€¢	Be simple, maintainable, and real-time compatible for PLC deployment in industrial mixing applications

VAR
    // Inputs
    Desired_Ratio : REAL := 2.0;          // Target ratio A:B
    Flow_B : REAL;                        // Measured flow of Reactant B
    Concentration_B : REAL := 0.8;        // Optional input
    Temperature_B : REAL := 25.0;         // Optional input

    // Compensation factor (if needed)
    Compensation_Factor : REAL := 1.0;

    // Output
    Flow_A_Setpoint : REAL;

// Feedforward calculation for Reactant A

// Optional: dynamic compensation logic
