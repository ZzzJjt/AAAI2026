### Intent:
**Intent Summary:**  
Create a reusable IEC 61131-3 Structured Text function block (`CAN_REGISTER_COBID`) to dynamically register/deregister CANOpen PDOs (via COBIDs) with error handling, network management, and buffer clearing when COBID=0.  

*(For OPC UA snippet: Establish secure client connection/disconnection functions with timeout and error handling.)*

### Prompt:
**CANOpen PDO Registration Using 61131-3 Structured Text:**

Develop a structured text (ST) function block named CAN_REGISTER_COBID based on IEC 61131 standards. The block will be responsible for registering or deleting a PDO (Process Data Object) or CAN Layer 2 message for reception by the network layer. When the REGISTER input is set to TRUE, the specified COBID (CAN identifier) will be registered for receiving messages. If REGISTER is set to FALSE, the registration of the respective COBID will be deleted. Additionally, when REGISTER is FALSE and COBID is set to 0, all registrations and messages stored in the network layer buffer will be cleared. Discuss the function blockâ€™s implementation, including error handling, network communication management, and memory buffer clearing mechanisms.

**B-A-B:**

ðŸŸ¥ B (Before) â€“ The Challenge

In CANOpen-based industrial systems, managing the registration and deregistration of Process Data Objects (PDOs) or CAN Layer 2 messages can be complex and error-prone. Manual handling of COBID message reception lacks modularity, robust error handling, and efficient memory management, which increases the risk of communication issues and system instability.

ðŸŸ© A (After) â€“ The Ideal State

Create a reusable IEC 61131-3 Structured Text function block named CAN_REGISTER_COBID that reliably registers or deregisters specific COBIDs based on a boolean input. When REGISTER is set to TRUE, the specified COBID is registered to receive messages. When REGISTER is FALSE, the registration is removed. Furthermore, if REGISTER is FALSE and COBID equals 0, the function block clears all registered COBIDs and purges the network layer buffer. The block includes robust error handling, communication management, and memory buffer clearing capabilities.

ðŸŸ§ B (Bridge) â€“ The Solution Path

Implement the function block with well-defined inputs, outputs, and internal state management. Use logical conditions to handle registration, deregistration, and full reset operations. Integrate fault detection for invalid COBIDs, duplicate registrations, and network communication errors, returning appropriate status flags or error codes. This modular function block ensures reliable, safe, and dynamic PDO registration in CANOpen networks, improving system maintainability and communication robustness.

**Function Block Implementation:**

```
FUNCTION CAN_REGISTER_COBID(
    INPUT boolean REGISTER,
    INPUT COBID COBID_ID,
    OUTPUT boolean COBID_STATUS,
    OUTPUT boolean ERROR_FLAG
)
BEGIN
    // Initialize variables
    boolean COBID_REG = FALSE;
    boolean ERROR_DETECTED = FALSE;
    boolean COBID_CLEAR = FALSE;

    // Check if REGISTER is TRUE
    IF REGISTER = TRUE THEN
        // Check if COBID_ID is valid
        IF COBID_ID IS NOT NULL AND COBID_ID IS NOT "0" THEN
            COBID_REG = TRUE;
        ELSE
            ERROR_DETECTED = TRUE;
        END IF;
    END IF;

    // Check if REGISTER is FALSE and COBID_ID is 0
    IF REGISTER = FALSE AND COBID_ID = "0" THEN
        COBID_CLEAR = TRUE;
    END IF;

    // Check if any errors were detected
    IF ERROR_DETECTED = TRUE THEN
        ERROR_FLAG = TRUE;
    ELSE
        ERROR_FLAG = FALSE;
    END IF;

    // Return COBID_REG and COBID_STATUS
    COBID_STATUS = COBID_REG;
    RETURN;
END;
```

**Function Block Outputs:**

1. COBID_STATUS: Returns TRUE if the COBID is successfully registered or FALSE if it is not.
2. ERROR_FLAG: Returns TRUE if an error occurred during the operation and FALSE if the operation was successful.

**Function Block Usage:**

```
// Register COBID
CALL CAN_REGISTER_COBID(TRUE, 123, OUTPUT COBID_STATUS, OUTPUT ERROR_FLAG);

// De-register COBID
CALL CAN_REGISTER_COBID(FALSE, 123, OUTPUT COBID_STATUS, OUTPUT ERROR_FLAG);

// Clear COBIDs and network buffer
CALL CAN_REGISTER_COBID(FALSE, 0, OUTPUT COBID_STATUS, OUTPUT ERROR_FLAG);
```
