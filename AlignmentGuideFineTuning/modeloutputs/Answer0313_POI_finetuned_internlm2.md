### Intent:
**Intent Summary:**  
Develop an IEC 61131-3 Structured Text program for feedforward control of a conveyor belt, adjusting speed preemptively based on sensor-predicted load inputs to optimize efficiency and reduce mechanical stress, with safety limits and diagnostic logging.

### Prompt:
**Feedforward Control Conveyor:**

Develop a self-contained IEC 61131-3 Structured Text program (not a function block) to implement feedforward control for adjusting the speed of a conveyor belt based on sensor-predicted load changes. The program should use input from sensors that predict the weight or volume of material entering the conveyor system, allowing for real-time adjustments to the belt speed before a load change occurs.

Include logic that calculates the required conveyor speed based on the predicted load and adjusts the motor speed accordingly, ensuring that the conveyor operates efficiently without overloading or underloading. Discuss the benefits of feedforward control in conveyor systems, particularly in reducing delays and improving response times compared to feedback-only control strategies.

**C-A-R-E:**

ðŸŸ¥ C (Context) â€“ The Background

Conveyor systems that rely only on feedback control may react too slowly to sudden load changes, leading to inefficiencies such as material overflow, underloading, or mechanical stress. In dynamic environments where loads vary frequently, feedforward control enables more proactive and efficient conveyor operation by adjusting speed in anticipation of incoming loads.

ðŸŸ© A (Action) â€“ The Implementation Task

Develop a self-contained IEC 61131-3 Structured Text program (not a function block) that uses feedforward control to regulate conveyor belt speed based on sensor-predicted load data. The program should:
	â€¢	Receive real-time input from a load prediction sensor (e.g., weight or volume).
	â€¢	Calculate the desired speed using a feedforward gain that maps load to conveyor speed.
	â€¢	Adjust the motor output speed accordingly to prepare for upcoming changes in material flow.
	â€¢	Include logic to clamp speed limits for safe operation.

â¸»

ðŸŸ¨ R (Result) â€“ The Expected Outcome

The conveyor system will:
	â€¢	Preemptively adjust speed before a load arrives, ensuring smooth and efficient movement of materials.
	â€¢	Avoid issues such as material congestion, underutilization, or delayed acceleration.
	â€¢	Reduce mechanical wear and improve energy efficiency.
	â€¢	Perform better than systems relying solely on feedback control.

ðŸŸ¦ E (Example) â€“ Code Snippet

VAR
    // Inputs
    Predicted_Load : REAL;         // Load from upstream sensor (e.g., kg)
    Base_Speed : REAL := 1.0;      // Minimum conveyor speed (m/s)
    Max_Load : REAL := 100.0;      // Load scaling reference
    Gain_FF : REAL := 0.02;        // Feedforward gain (speed per kg)

    // Output
    Conveyor_Speed : REAL;
END_VAR

// Feedforward speed calculation
Conveyor_Speed := Base_Speed + Gain_FF * Predicted_Load;

// Clamp speed to operational limits
IF Conveyor_Speed > 2.0 THEN
    Conveyor_Speed := 2.0;
ELSIF Conveyor_Speed < 0.5 THEN
    Conveyor_Speed := 0.5;
END_IF

// Conveyor_Speed is used to drive the conveyor motor
This approach enables real-time speed optimization and proactive material handling, especially in applications with fast-changing or unpredictable loads.
