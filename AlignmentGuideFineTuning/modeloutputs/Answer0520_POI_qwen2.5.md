ðŸŸ¥ R (Role) â€“ Your Role

You are a PLC programmer or control systems engineer responsible for implementing precise and smooth interpolation methods in IEC 61131-3 Structured Text. Your task is to design a function block that enables real-time spline interpolation between a set of known data points in industrial automation applications.

ðŸŸ© I (Input) â€“ What Youâ€™re Given

You are required to develop a function block that:
	â€¢	Takes as inputs:
	â€¢	X : ARRAY[1..N] OF REAL â€” known x-values
	â€¢	Y : ARRAY[1..N] OF REAL â€” known corresponding y-values
	â€¢	TargetX : REAL â€” the x-value at which to evaluate the interpolated y
	â€¢	Produces as output:
	â€¢	InterpolatedY : REAL â€” the spline-interpolated y-value at TargetX

You must also consider:
	â€¢	Ensuring smoothness and continuity of the interpolation
	â€¢	Optimizing the algorithm for limited memory and processing time on a PLC
	â€¢	Providing clear documentation and reusable structure

â¸»

ðŸŸ§ S (Steps) â€“ What You Need to Do
	1.	Create a function block named SplineInterpolator with appropriate input/output declarations.
	2.	Design the logic to:
	â€¢	Identify the interval [X[i], X[i+1]] that contains TargetX
	â€¢	Use precomputed cubic spline coefficients (a, b, c, d) for that segment
	â€¢	Evaluate the spline using the formula:
y = a + b(x - x_i) + c(x - x_i)^2 + d(x - x_i)^3
	3.	Comment the code to explain:
	â€¢	How spline coefficients are structured
	â€¢	How the interval is selected at runtime
	â€¢	How the evaluation is performed efficiently within one scan cycle
	4.	Handle edge cases:
	â€¢	Clamp TargetX if itâ€™s out of bounds
	â€¢	Warn about insufficient data points (fewer than 3)
	â€¢	Flag potential memory/performance limitations for large datasets

â¸»

ðŸŸ¦ E (Expectation) â€“ What Success Looks Like

You deliver a real-time capable, reusable function block that:
	â€¢	Computes smooth, continuous interpolated values over a set of known points
	â€¢	Minimizes runtime computation by separating initialization and evaluation phases
	â€¢	Improves curve fidelity in applications such as:
	â€¢	Motion trajectory generation
	â€¢	Signal smoothing
	â€¢	Profile-based control (e.g., temperature, pressure, flow)

The solution enables high-quality interpolation directly within the PLC, without relying on external devices or approximation hacks.

**Spline Interpolation in PLCs: A Structured Text Approach**

This function block, named `SplineInterpolator`, is designed to perform real-time cubic spline interpolation in IEC 61131-3 Structured Text. It takes an array of known x-values (`X`), an array of corresponding y-values (`Y`), and a target x-value (`TargetX`) to compute the interpolated y-value (`InterpolatedY`). The function block is optimized for PLC environments, ensuring smoothness, continuity, and efficient computation within one scan cycle.

**Function Block Declaration:**

```structuredtext
FUNCTION_BLOCK SplineInterpolator
VAR_INPUT
    X : ARRAY[1..N] OF REAL; // Known x-values
    Y : ARRAY[1..N] OF REAL; // Known corresponding y-values
    TargetX : REAL; // The x-value at which to evaluate the interpolated y
END_VAR

VAR_OUTPUT
    InterpolatedY : REAL; // The spline-interpolated y-value at TargetX
END_VAR

VAR
    N : INT; // Number of data points
    a, b, c, d : ARRAY[1..N-1] OF REAL; // Precomputed spline coefficients
    i : INT; // Index for interval selection
    x_i, x_i1 : REAL; // Endpoints of the interval containing TargetX
    h : REAL; // Distance between x_i and x_i1
END_VAR
```

**Function Block Logic:**

```structuredtext
METHOD Initialize
    N := UBOUND(X, 1);
    IF N < 3 THEN
        // Insufficient data points
        InterpolatedY := 0.0;
        RETURN;
    END_IF;

    // Precompute spline coefficients
    FOR i := 1 TO N-1 DO
        h := X[i+1] - X[i];
        a[i] := Y[i];
        b[i] := (Y[i+1] - Y[i]) / h;
        c[i] := (b[i+1] - b[i]) / h;
        d[i] := (c[i+1] - c[i]) / (2 * h);
    END_FOR;
END_METHOD

METHOD Evaluate
    i := 1;
    WHILE i < N AND TargetX > X[i] DO
        i
