### Intent:
"Implement a 2:1 ratio control system in Structured Text that dynamically adjusts Reactant B's flow rate to maintain the specified ratio with Reactant A, including input validation, error monitoring, and safety constraints."

### Prompt:
**Ratio Control Mixing:**

Develop a self-contained IEC 61131-3 Structured Text program (not a function block) to implement ratio control for mixing two reactants in a 2:1 ratio. The program should maintain the desired ratio between the two reactants by adjusting their flow rates dynamically, ensuring that for every two parts of reactant A, one part of reactant B is added.

Include logic to monitor the flow rates of both reactants and adjust one flow rate relative to the other to maintain the 2:1 ratio. The program should also handle any disturbances or variations in flow, adjusting the control signals to correct for deviations from the target ratio. Discuss the importance of ratio control in maintaining the desired chemical composition and the impact of disturbances on the mixing process.

The output should be a clean IEC 61131-3 Structured Text code block like this:

VAR
    Flow_A_PV : REAL;                 // Measured flow rate of Reactant A
    Flow_B_PV : REAL;                 // Measured flow rate of Reactant B
    Flow_B_SP : REAL;                 // Setpoint for Reactant B (output)

    Ratio_Setpoint : REAL := 2.0;     // Desired ratio A:B = 2:1
    Actual_Ratio : REAL;
    Error : REAL;
    Tolerance : REAL := 0.05;         // Allowable deviation
END_VAR

// Calculate actual ratio (A:B)
IF Flow_B_PV > 0.0 THEN
    Actual_Ratio := Flow_A_PV / Flow_B_PV;
ELSE
    Actual_Ratio := 0.0;
END_IF

// Compute required flow setpoint for Reactant B
Flow_B_SP := Flow_A_PV / Ratio_Setpoint;

// Optional: Calculate ratio error for monitoring
Error := Actual_Ratio - Ratio_Setpoint;
IF ABS(Error) > Tolerance THEN
    // Raise alarm, activate flag, or correct with fallback logic
END_IF

**Safety Constraints and Error Handling:**

Ensure that the program includes safety constraints and error handling mechanisms to prevent overflows, underflows, or other potential issues that could arise from the calculations. For example, if the flow rate of reactant A is zero, the program should handle this case gracefully without causing a division by zero error.

**Input Validation:**

Implement input validation to ensure that the flow rates of both reactants are within acceptable ranges before performing any calculations. This will help prevent the program from entering an invalid state and potentially causing harm to the system or personnel.

**Error Monitoring:**

Monitor the flow rates of both reactants continuously and raise alarms or flags when the system deviates from the desired ratio. This will allow operators to take corrective action before the process becomes unstable or unsafe.

**PID Flow Controller:**

Prepare the calculated setpoint for flow B to be sent to a PID flow controller, which will adjust the flow rate of reactant B to maintain the desired ratio. Ensure that the PID controller is properly tuned and configured to respond quickly and accurately to changes in the flow rates of both reactants.

**Tolerance Checking:**

Include tolerance checking to account for small variations in the flow rates of both reactants. This will help prevent the program from overreacting to minor fluctuations and causing unnecessary adjustments to the flow rates.

**Alarm and Flag Mechanisms:**

Implement alarm and flag mechanisms to notify operators when the system deviates from the desired ratio or when there are issues with the flow rates of either reactant. This will help ensure that operators are aware of any problems and can take corrective action before the process becomes unstable or unsafe.

**Fallback Logic:**

In case of a failure or malfunction in the PID flow controller, implement fallback logic to adjust the flow rates of both reactants manually or using a backup control system. This will help prevent the process from becoming unstable or unsafe in the event of a failure.

**Documentation and Testing:**

Document the program thoroughly, including the purpose of each variable, the logic behind the calculations, and the safety constraints and error handling mechanisms. Test the program thoroughly to ensure that it meets the requirements and functions correctly under various conditions.
