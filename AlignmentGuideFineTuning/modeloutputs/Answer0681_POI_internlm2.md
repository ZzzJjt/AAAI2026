**Control Narrative Beer Brewing:**

**1. Beer Brewing Process**

The beer brewing process consists of several stages, each with its own set of control parameters. These stages include:

- **Mashing:** The process of converting starches in the grain into fermentable sugars. Control parameters include mash temperature, pH, and time.
- **Lautering:** The process of separating the liquid wort from the solid spent grain. Control parameters include lauter tun temperature, turbidity, and flow rate.
- **Boiling:** The process of sterilizing the wort and adding hops for bitterness and flavor. Control parameters include boiling time, temperature, and hop addition schedule.
- **Fermentation:** The process of converting sugars into alcohol and carbon dioxide. Control parameters include temperature, pH, and oxygen levels.
- **Packaging:** The process of filling and packaging the finished beer. Control parameters include fill volume, carbonation level, and temperature.

**2. Lautering Process**

The lautering process is a critical stage in the beer brewing process. It involves separating the liquid wort from the solid spent grain. The following equipment and instrumentation are required for this process:

- **Lauter Tun:** A large, insulated vessel used to hold the mash and lauter water.
- **Rake Mechanism:** A device used to stir the mash and ensure even distribution of water.
- **Sparge Arm:** A pipe used to introduce sparge water into the lauter tun.
- **Pump:** A device used to circulate the wort and sparge water.
- **Level Sensor:** A device used to measure the level of the wort in the lauter tun.
- **Turbidity Meter:** A device used to measure the clarity of the wort.
- **Flow Transmitter:** A device used to measure the flow rate of the wort and sparge water.
- **Temperature Probe:** A device used to measure the temperature of the wort and sparge water.

**3. Lautering Process Steps**

The following steps should be followed during the lautering process:

1. **Start Recirculation Loop:** Begin circulating the wort and sparge water through the lauter tun using the pump.
2. **Monitor Turbidity:** Continuously monitor the turbidity of the wort using the turbidity meter. Continue rec
