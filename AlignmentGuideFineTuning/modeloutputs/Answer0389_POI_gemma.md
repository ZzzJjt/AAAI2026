### Intent:
Create a NORSOK-compliant textual System Control Diagram (SCD) for an LNG vaporizer system, including instrumentation tags, control loops, and safety interlocks in structured notation.

### Prompt:
**SCD LNG Vaporizer:**

Create a NORSOK system control diagram (SCD) in textual notation for a LNG Vaporizer System. Include instrumentation, control loops, and interlocks. Provide concrete tag numbers and piping.


**C-A-R-E:**

ðŸŸ¥ C (Context) â€“ Background Situation

In LNG (Liquefied Natural Gas) processing, the vaporizer system plays a critical role in converting LNG into gas for downstream use. For projects governed by NORSOK standards, a System Control Diagram (SCD) is required to document control loops, instrumentation, and interlocks in a structured, traceable format. When graphical SCD tools are unavailableâ€”such as in early design phases or text-based engineering environmentsâ€”engineers must rely on textual notation to convey the same level of detail and logic clarity.

ðŸŸ© A (Action) â€“ Task to Perform

Create a NORSOK-compliant System Control Diagram (SCD) using textual notation for an LNG vaporizer system. The diagram should include:
	â€¢	Major equipment and piping flow (e.g., LNG inlet â†’ vaporizer â†’ gas outlet)
	â€¢	Key instrumentation and control loops, with standard tag names (e.g., TT101, FIC201, FCV202)
	â€¢	Defined interlocks and trip signals, such as high-pressure shutdowns or emergency stop triggers
	â€¢	Logical formatting using directional arrows (-->), indents, and grouped sections for clarity

â¸»

ðŸŸ¨ R (Result) â€“ Expected Outcome

The result will be a structured, readable, and logically complete textual SCD that can:
	â€¢	Support system design, safety analysis, and DCS/PLC implementation
	â€¢	Facilitate interdepartmental review of instrumentation and control logic
	â€¢	Comply with NORSOK I-005 standards for system documentation
	â€¢	Act as a draft for graphical SCD development later in the design phase

ðŸŸ¦ E (Example) â€“ Concrete Illustration

LNG Inlet --> FT201 --> FIC201 --> FCV201 --> Vaporizer Unit --> Gas Outlet

[Vaporizer Control Loop]
  TT101 --> TIC101 --> TCV101 (Heater Steam Valve)

[Safety Interlocks]
  PSH301 --> ESD1 (Shutdown Heater on High Pressure)
  TSH302 --> ESD2 (Shutdown Vaporizer on High Temperature)

[Flow Trip]
  FT201 low < 5 kg/h --> Alarm A101 --> Auto FCV201 Close
