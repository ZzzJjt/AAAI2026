### Intent:
**Intent Summary:**  
Develop a PLC-based control narrative for ethanol fermentation, specifying setpoints (e.g., 32â€“35Â°C, pH 4.5â€“5.0), instrumentation (temperature/pH sensors, dosing pumps), and interlocks (temperature/pH deviations, failed inoculation) to automate batch fermentation with safety and quality compliance.

ðŸŸ© T (Task) â€“ Define the Objective

Develop a detailed control narrative for the beer brewing process, including:
	â€¢	Concrete setpoints and control ranges for each brewing stage
	â€¢	A comprehensive Section 4 â€“ Lautering, which must include:
	â€¢	Description of required equipment and instrumentation
	â€¢	A step-by-step procedure for lautering
	â€¢	Embedded control logic and interlocks, such as turbidity thresholds and flow control

â¸»

ðŸŸ§ F (Format) â€“ Specify the Output Format

Deliver the control narrative in a structured format consisting of:
	1.	Process Overview
	â€¢	Define key stages: mashing, lautering, boiling, fermentation, etc.
	â€¢	Include numeric control parameters (e.g., mash temperature: 66â€¯Â°C Â± 1â€¯Â°C, sparge water temp: 76â€¯Â°C)
	2.	Section 4 â€“ Lautering
	â€¢	Equipment: Lauter tun, rake motor, flow meters, level sensors, turbidity probe
	â€¢	Instrumentation:
	â€¢	LT-401: Lauter tun level transmitter
	â€¢	FT-402: Wort outlet flow transmitter
	â€¢	TT-403: Sparge water temperature sensor
	â€¢	TU-404: Turbidity meter at wort outlet
	â€¢	Control Sequence:
	1.	Initiate recirculation
	2.	Monitor turbidity until it falls below 200 NTU
	3.	Begin wort transfer to kettle while initiating sparge water at 76â€¯Â°C
	4.	Maintain level in lauter tun (60â€“80%)
	5.	Stop lautering when flow < 0.5 L/min or target volume reached
	3.	Outputs:
	â€¢	Control flags (LauterStart, LauterStop, DivertCloudyWort)
	â€¢	Comments and logic interlocks

ðŸŸ¥ A (Action) â€“ Execute the Task

Write a detailed control narrative for the beer brewing process, including concrete setpoints and control ranges for each brewing stage. Focus on Section 4 â€“ Lautering, providing a description of the required equipment and instrumentation, as well as a step-by-step procedure for lautering. Include embedded control logic and interlocks, such as turbidity thresholds and flow control.

**C-A-R-E:**

ðŸŸ¥ C (Context) â€“ Set the Stage

Beer brewing is a complex process that requires precise control of temperature, flow, and turbidity to ensure consistent quality. The lautering stage is critical for separating the liquid wort from the solid grains, and it must be executed with care to avoid cloudy wort or over-extraction of flavor compounds.
