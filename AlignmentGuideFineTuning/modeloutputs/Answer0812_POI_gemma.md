### Intent:
The task is to **implement a Python-based fuzzy logic control system for optimizing chemical reactor performance by managing temperature, pressure, and reaction rate under dynamic and uncertain conditions**.  

*(Intent: Develop adaptive fuzzy control for nonlinear reactor dynamics in Python.)*

### Prompt:
**Fuzzy Logic Control for Chemical Reactor Optimization Using Python:**

Develop Python code to implement a fuzzy logic control system for optimizing the operation of a chemical reactor. The control system should manage key reactor variables such as temperature, pressure, and reaction rate, considering the nonlinear and uncertain nature of the reactorâ€™s dynamics. Fuzzy logic should be applied to handle imprecise inputs and adjust control actions in real-time to maintain optimal reactor performance under varying operating conditions.

Implement Python code to simulate the chemical reactorâ€™s dynamics, demonstrating how fuzzy logic control can provide robust and adaptive responses to system uncertainties and process variations.
