### Intent:
**Intent Summary:**  
Create a reusable IEC 61131-3 Structured Text function block (`CAN_REGISTER_COBID`) to dynamically register/deregister CANOpen PDOs (via COBIDs) with error handling, network management, and buffer clearing when COBID=0.  

*(For OPC UA snippet: Establish secure client connection/disconnection functions with timeout and error handling.)*

### Prompt:
**CANOpen PDO Registration Using 61131-3 Structured Text:**

Develop a structured text (ST) function block named CAN_REGISTER_COBID based on IEC 61131 standards. The block will be responsible for registering or deleting a PDO (Process Data Object) or CAN Layer 2 message for reception by the network layer. When the REGISTER input is set to TRUE, the specified COBID (CAN identifier) will be registered for receiving messages. If REGISTER is set to FALSE, the registration of the respective COBID will be deleted. Additionally, when REGISTER is FALSE and COBID is set to 0, all registrations and messages stored in the network layer buffer will be cleared. Discuss the function blockâ€™s implementation, including error handling, network communication management, and memory buffer clearing mechanisms.

**B-A-B:**

ðŸŸ¥ B (Before) â€“ The Challenge

In CANOpen-based industrial systems, managing the registration and deregistration of Process Data Objects (PDOs) or CAN Layer 2 messages can be complex and error-prone. Manual handling of COBID message reception lacks modularity, robust error handling, and efficient memory management, which increases the risk of communication issues and system instability.

ðŸŸ© A (After) â€“ The Ideal State

Create a reusable IEC 61131-3 Structured Text function block named CAN_REGISTER_COBID that reliably registers or deregisters specific COBIDs based on a boolean input. When REGISTER is set to TRUE, the specified COBID is registered to receive messages. When REGISTER is FALSE, the registration is removed. Furthermore, if REGISTER is FALSE and COBID equals 0, the function block clears all registered COBIDs and purges the network layer buffer. The block includes robust error handling, communication management, and memory buffer clearing capabilities.

ðŸŸ§ B (Bridge) â€“ The Solution Path

Implement the function block with well-defined inputs, outputs, and internal state management. Use logical conditions to handle registration, deregistration, and full reset operations. Integrate fault detection for invalid COBIDs, duplicate registrations, and network communication errors, returning appropriate status flags or error codes. This modular function block ensures reliable, safe, and dynamic PDO registration in CANOpen networks, improving system maintainability and communication robustness.

**OPC UA Client Connection/Disconnection:**

Create a structured text (ST) function block named OPC_UA_CLIENT_CONNECT that establishes a secure client connection to an OPC UA server. The function block should include inputs for the server address, port, and security settings, as well as an output for the connection status. The function block should also include a timeout mechanism to ensure that the connection is established within a specified time frame. If the connection is not established within the specified time frame, the function block should return an error code.

Create a structured text (ST) function block named OPC_UA_CLIENT_DISCONNECT that disconnects the client from the OPC UA server. The function block should include an input for the connection handle and an output for the disconnection status. The function block should also include a timeout mechanism to ensure that the disconnection is completed within a specified time frame. If the disconnection is not completed within the specified time frame, the function block should return an error code.
