### Intent:
**Intent Summary:**  
Develop an IEC 61131-3 Structured Text program to sequentially control an EtherCAT slave device’s state transitions (INIT → PREOP → SAFEOP → OP) with 5-second delays, error checking, and symbolic state names for compliance and reliability.  

*(Key focus: Sequential state transitions, timing, error handling, and readability.)*

### Prompt:
**EtherCAT State Machine Control Using IEC 61131-3 Structured Text:**

Develop an IEC 61131-3 structured text (ST) program to sequentially transition through all the states of an EtherCAT slave device using the ESM (EtherCAT State Machine) function block. The program should use descriptive state names (such as INIT, PREOP, SAFEOP, OP, etc.) rather than numerical values, ensuring that state transitions occur only when allowed. A 5-second timer delay should be implemented before each state transition to ensure proper timing and stabilization. Discuss the implementation of the EtherCAT state machine, including logic for handling state transitions, error checking, and ensuring compliance with EtherCAT protocol requirements.

**C-A-R-E:**

🟥 C (Context) – The Background

In EtherCAT networks, slave devices follow a strict sequence of operational states—INIT, PREOP, SAFEOP, and OP—that must be respected for reliable communication and system safety. Improper transitions or timing can cause initialization failures, data loss, or non-compliance with the EtherCAT standard.

🟩 A (Action) – The Implementation Task

Develop an IEC 61131-3 Structured Text (ST) program that controls the EtherCAT State Machine (ESM) for a slave device. The program should transition sequentially through the INIT → PREOP → SAFEOP → OP states using descriptive symbolic names rather than numeric codes. A 5-second delay should be implemented between each state transition to allow stabilization. The logic must verify that each transition is valid before proceeding and include error-checking to handle failures gracefully.

🟨 R (Result) – The Expected Outcome

The program should ensure compliant, reliable transitions across all EtherCAT states, improving network stability and diagnostic clarity. Using symbolic state names enhances readability and maintainability, while built-in delay and error-handling mechanisms ensure safe and predictable device initialization.

🟦 E (Example) – A Practical Use Case

For example, after power-up, the device starts in the INIT state. The program waits 5 seconds, checks that the slave is ready, and transitions to PREOP. After another 5 seconds and verification, it moves to SAFEOP, and finally to OP. If any transition fails (e.g., due to a configuration error), the program logs the error and halts further progression, allowing operators to investigate and correct the issue.
