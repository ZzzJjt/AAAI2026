### Intent:
**Intent Summary:**  
Develop an IEC 61131-3 Structured Text function block to retrieve and process real-time diagnostic data (status, errors, health) from a Profibus DP slave device, with cyclic polling, timeout handling, and structured output for fault monitoring and maintenance.

### Prompt:
**Ethernet PowerLink Diagnostics Using IEC 61131-3 Structured Text:**

Develop a function block in structured text (ST) based on IEC 61131 standards to retrieve Ethernet PowerLink diagnostic information from a control node device via a PowerLink managing node (MN). The function block should collect and display key diagnostic data such as communication status, error codes, and node health. The program must ensure that the diagnostic information is accurately processed and relayed to the controller for further analysis. Discuss how the function block interacts with the PowerLink network, handles error detection, and provides real-time diagnostics for maintaining network integrity.

**R-I-S-E:**

ðŸŸ¥ R (Role) â€“ Your Role

Act as an industrial automation engineer developing diagnostics and communication monitoring tools using IEC 61131-3 Structured Text for Ethernet PowerLink networks.

ðŸŸ© I (Input) â€“ What Youâ€™re Given

You are tasked with building a function block in Structured Text (ST) that retrieves diagnostic information from a PowerLink control node via a PowerLink Managing Node (MN). The diagnostic data must include communication status, error codes, and node health. The data should be processed and passed to the controller for analysis and real-time monitoring. The solution must handle error detection and support cyclic updates.

ðŸŸ§ S (Steps) â€“ What to Do

	1.	Design a function block interface with inputs for node identifiers and communication triggers, and outputs for status, error codes, and health indicators.
 
	2.	Implement cyclic polling logic that queries the MN for diagnostic information related to connected control nodes.
 
	3.	Parse and validate the returned diagnostic data, handling potential communication errors or missing responses.
 
	4.	Output structured diagnostic results to the controller or HMI, and ensure any critical errors are flagged appropriately for operator awareness.

ðŸŸ¦ E (Expectation) â€“ What Success Looks Like

The function block should provide accurate, real-time insight into the health of each PowerLink node. It should detect and report faults immediately, support maintenance decisions, and ensure that communication issues are logged and traceableâ€”enhancing system reliability and reducing troubleshooting time.

**Function Block Design:**

```structuredtext
FUNCTION_BLOCK EthernetPowerLinkDiagnostics
VAR_INPUT
    NodeID : INT; // Identifier for the PowerLink control node
    PollingInterval : INT; // Time interval for cyclic polling in milliseconds
    CommunicationTrigger : BOOL; // Trigger for initiating communication
END_VAR

VAR_OUTPUT
    CommunicationStatus : BOOL; // Status of communication with the node
    ErrorCode : INT; // Error code from the node
    NodeHealth : INT; // Health indicator of the node
END_VAR

VAR
    LastPollTime : TIME; // Last time the node was polled
    DiagnosticData : ARRAY[1..10] OF INT; // Array to hold diagnostic data
END_VAR

METHOD Initialize
    // Initialize variables and set up any necessary resources
END_METHOD

METHOD PollNode
    // Implement logic to query the MN for diagnostic information
    // Parse and validate the returned data
    // Update the DiagnosticData array with the latest information
END_METHOD

METHOD ProcessData
    // Process the diagnostic data to extract status, error codes, and health
    // Update the CommunicationStatus, ErrorCode, and NodeHealth outputs
END_METHOD

METHOD Update
    // Main update method that triggers cyclic polling and data processing
    IF CommunicationTrigger OR (TIME_OF_DAY - LastPollTime) >= PollingInterval THEN
        PollNode();
        ProcessData();
        LastPollTime := TIME_OF_DAY;
    END_IF
END_METHOD
END_FUNCTION_BLOCK
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Initialization**: The `Initialize` method sets up the function block by initializing variables and any necessary resources.

2. **Polling Node**: The `PollNode` method is responsible for querying the PowerLink Managing Node for diagnostic information related to the specified control node. It should handle potential communication errors and missing responses.

3. **Process Data**: The `ProcessData` method parses the diagnostic data to extract the communication status, error codes, and health indicators. It updates the corresponding outputs.

4. **Update Method**: The `Update` method is the main cyclic update method. It checks if the communication trigger is set or if the time since the last poll exceeds the polling interval. If either condition is met, it triggers the `PollNode` and `ProcessData` methods to update the diagnostic information.

This function block design ensures that the diagnostic information is retrieved and processed
