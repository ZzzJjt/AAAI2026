### Intent:
"Develop a Structured Text program to maintain a 2:1 ratio between two reactant flows by dynamically adjusting flow B based on measured flow A, with tolerance monitoring and disturbance correction."

### Prompt:
**Ratio Control Mixing:**

Develop a self-contained IEC 61131-3 Structured Text program (not a function block) to implement ratio control for mixing two reactants in a 2:1 ratio. The program should maintain the desired ratio between the two reactants by adjusting their flow rates dynamically, ensuring that for every two parts of reactant A, one part of reactant B is added.

Include logic to monitor the flow rates of both reactants and adjust one flow rate relative to the other to maintain the 2:1 ratio. The program should also handle any disturbances or variations in flow, adjusting the control signals to correct for deviations from the target ratio. Discuss the importance of ratio control in maintaining the desired chemical composition and the impact of disturbances on the mixing process.

**R**eal-time control of the mixing ratio is critical for maintaining the desired chemical composition in continuous processes. Disturbances, such as changes in flow rates, can cause the ratio to deviate from the setpoint, potentially leading to suboptimal reactions or product quality issues. By implementing a self-contained ratio control system in IEC 61131-3 Structured Text, you can ensure precise mixing and improve process stability in real-time applications.**
