### Intent:
**Intent Summary:**  
Create an IEC 61131-3 compliant Sequential Function Chart (SFC) in ASCII art for a traffic light system with timed states (Green: 5s, Yellow: 2s, Red: 5s) using TON timers, looping indefinitely.  

*(Focus: SFC structure, timing logic, ASCII visualization, cyclic operation.)*

### Prompt:
**SFC Traffic Light:**

Create a 61131-3 sequential function chart in ASCII art for a traffic light. Include proper delays for switching the lights.

**R-I-S-E:**

ðŸŸ¥ R (Role) â€“ Define Your Role

Act as a PLC programmer or automation engineer tasked with designing a Sequential Function Chart (SFC) for a traffic light control system using IEC 61131-3 standards in ASCII format.

â¸»

ðŸŸ© I (Input) â€“ Information Provided

You need to design a traffic light cycle with the following features:
	â€¢	Three sequential states: Green, Yellow, and Red
	â€¢	Each light stays on for a fixed duration:
	â€¢	Green: 5 seconds
	â€¢	Yellow: 2 seconds
	â€¢	Red: 5 seconds
	â€¢	Use TON (on-delay) timers to manage timing
	â€¢	The diagram should be presented as ASCII art that visually represents steps, transitions, and timers

â¸»

ðŸŸ§ S (Steps) â€“ Steps to Perform
	1.	Define the SFC structure with three steps (S1: Green, S2: Yellow, S3: Red)
	2.	For each step, assign a TON timer with an appropriate preset time
	3.	Add transitions that are triggered when each timer completes (tGreen.Q, tYellow.Q, tRed.Q)
	4.	Format the steps and transitions using clear ASCII blocks and arrows to represent flow
	5.	Close the cycle by looping the final transition (Red â†’ Green)

â¸»

ðŸŸ¦ E (Expectation) â€“ Expected Outcome

Produce a plain-text Sequential Function Chart that clearly outlines the logic and timing of a traffic light control system. This SFC should be:
	â€¢	Standards-compliant with IEC 61131-3
	â€¢	Readable and understandable in environments without graphics
	â€¢	Useful for PLC implementation, documentation, and training

ðŸŸ¥ R (Role) â€“ Review and Refine

Review the SFC for accuracy, readability, and compliance with IEC 61131-3 standards. Ensure that the diagram effectively communicates the intended traffic light cycle and can be easily implemented in a PLC.

**ASCII SFC Traffic Light:**

```
SFC: Traffic Light

S1: Green
  TON tGreen(5000ms)
  WHEN tGreen.Q
    GREEN
    tGreen.R
    GOTO S2

S2: Yellow
  TON tYellow(2000ms)
  WHEN tYellow.Q
    YELLOW
    tYellow.R
    GOTO S3

S3: Red
  TON tRed(5000ms)
  WHEN tRed.Q
    RED
    tRed.R
    GOTO S1
```

This ASCII SFC represents a traffic light control system with three states (Green, Yellow, Red) and TON timers for managing the duration of each state. The diagram is easy to read and can be implemented in a PLC using IEC 61131-3 standards.
