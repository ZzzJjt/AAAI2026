### Prompt:
**Fast Fourier Transform:**

Develop a self-contained function block in IEC 61131-3 Structured Text to compute the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) of a given input array. Ensure that the implementation is efficient and includes detailed comments explaining the algorithmic steps involved in computing the FFT.

üü• B (Before) ‚Äì The Challenge

Performing frequency-domain analysis on signal data is essential for applications such as vibration monitoring, motor diagnostics, and predictive maintenance. However, PLC platforms typically lack built-in support for Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) operations due to limited processing power, real-time cycle constraints, and memory limitations. Without an optimized implementation, FFT can be too slow or unstable for use in live industrial environments.

Design a self-contained IEC 61131-3 Structured Text function block named FFT_Block that:
	‚Ä¢	Accepts a REAL input array (e.g., InputSignal: ARRAY[1..N] OF REAL)
	‚Ä¢	Computes its Fast Fourier Transform, returning an array of complex magnitudes (or amplitude + phase)

	‚Ä¢	Bit-reversal reordering
	‚Ä¢	Butterfly computation
	‚Ä¢	Real/imaginary separation
	‚Ä¢	Includes parameters for windowing, normalization, or fixed input length where applicable

üüß B (Bridge) ‚Äì The Implementation Strategy

To implement this FFT function block:
	1.	Define input/output arrays and necessary internal variables (e.g., twiddle factors, index mapping).
	2.	Limit input size to a manageable, fixed length (e.g., 64 or 128 points) to ensure compatibility with PLC resources.
	3.	Precompute constants if possible to reduce real-time load.
	4.	Use a modular approach so the function block can be reused and integrated with HMI, data logging, or alarm systems.
	5.	Document limitations such as:
	‚Ä¢	‚ÄúThis block assumes a fixed power-of-two input length‚Äù
	‚Ä¢	‚ÄúDesigned for low-frequency, low-sample-rate industrial diagnostics‚Äù

This structure enables FFT computation directly on the PLC, making spectral analysis accessible for real-time condition monitoring without external hardware.
