### Intent:
**Intent Summary:**  
Develop an IEC 61131-3 Structured Text program to automate the safe shutdown of a furnace system, including gas flow ramp-down, oxygen adjustment, and temperature monitoring, while ensuring interlocks and gradual process transitions to prevent equipment damage.

### Prompt:
**Startup Paper Machine:**

Develop a detailed startup sequence for the press section of a Valmet paper machine, specifying typical parameter values such as press roll speed, nip pressure, and temperature settings. The sequence should include the step-by-step activation of the press section components, ensuring proper synchronization between the rolls and conveyors, and gradually ramping up to the operational speed.

Write a self-contained IEC 61131-3 Structured Text program to control this startup sequence. The program should include logic for managing interlocks, safety checks, and smooth transitions between startup phases. Discuss the significance of maintaining optimal nip pressure and temperature throughout the process to prevent damage to the paper sheet and equipment.
