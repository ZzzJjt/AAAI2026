**B-A-B:**

ðŸŸ¥ B (Before) â€“ The Problem or Challenge

Designing and integrating control systems for a rolling mill in a steel production plant requires a detailed and standardized I/O list. Without a well-organized table capturing key signal characteristics, such as I/O type, ranges, and engineering units, engineers risk miswiring, mismatches in PLC logic, and inconsistent documentation across instrumentation, control panels, and HMI systems.

ðŸŸ© A (After) â€“ The Desired Outcome

Create a structured I/O list table with 30 entries specific to a rolling mill system. The table should include the following columns for each signal:
	â€¢	Signal Name
	â€¢	Input/Output
	â€¢	Signal Tagnumber
	â€¢	Analog/Digital
	â€¢	Engineering Unit
	â€¢	Range
	â€¢	Setpoint
	â€¢	P&ID Reference

This list should serve as a foundation for instrumentation wiring, PLC configuration, and control narrative alignment, ensuring that all process signals are properly identified and described.

ðŸŸ§ B (Bridge) â€“ How to Get There
	1.	Identify typical signals in a rolling mill (e.g., entry tension, roll force, speed feedback, motor current, cooling valve command).
	2.	For each of the 30 entries, define:
	â€¢	Whether the signal is an input (sensor) or output (actuator)
	â€¢	Its analog/digital type
	â€¢	Units such as bar, Â°C, m/min, kN
	â€¢	Expected range and setpoint values
	â€¢	Reference back to a P&ID drawing for traceability
	3.	Present the data in a clean, consistent tabular format, suitable for use in Excel, a PDF datasheet, or PLC documentation.

**I-O:**

ðŸŸ¥ I (Input) â€“ The Challenge

In a steel production plant, a rolling mill is a critical process unit responsible for shaping and sizing hot-rolled steel sheets. The control system must manage various signals, including tension, roll force, speed, and temperature, to ensure consistent product quality and efficient operation. However, without a standardized I/O list, engineers may struggle to document and integrate these signals into the control system, leading to potential miswiring, inconsistent PLC logic, and communication issues between different engineering disciplines.

ðŸŸ© O (Output) â€“ The Solution

Create a 30-entry I/O list table for a rolling mill, with columns for signal name, I/O type, tagnumber, analog/digital classification, engineering unit, range, setpoint, and P&ID reference. This structured list will serve as a comprehensive reference for instrumentation, control panel wiring, and PLC programming, ensuring that all signals are properly identified and documented for seamless integration and traceability.

**R:**

ðŸŸ¥ R (Reasoning) â€“ The Logic

A rolling mill control system requires a detailed I/O list to ensure proper signal management and control logic. By organizing the list into a standardized table with clear columns, engineers can easily identify and document each signal's characteristics, including I/O type, tagnumber, analog/digital classification, engineering unit, range, setpoint, and P&ID reference. This structured approach facilitates communication between different engineering disciplines, reduces the risk of miswiring, and ensures that the control system is properly configured to meet the rolling mill's performance requirements.

**E:**

ðŸŸ¥ E (Evidence) â€“ The Data

Ensure that the table is well-organized, with clear column headings and consistent formatting for each entry.
