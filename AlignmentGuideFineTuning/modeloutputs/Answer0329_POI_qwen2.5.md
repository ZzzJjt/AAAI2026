### Intent:
**Intent Summary:**  
Create a Structured Text program to control a urea production reaction by managing ammonia and COâ‚‚ valve operations, monitoring pressure/temperature conditions, and timing the reaction process until completion.  

(Key elements: valve control, condition monitoring, timed reaction, process automation)

### Prompt:
**Programming Reference:**
Compile a comprehensive list of all valid keywords used in the IEC 61131-3 Structured Text programming language, ensuring that it covers both standard control flow structures and data types. Include examples of usage for key functions where applicable.

**C-A-R-E:**

ðŸŸ¥ C (Context)

IEC 61131-3 Structured Text is a widely used programming language in industrial automation. Despite its standardized nature, many developers lack a single, comprehensive reference that clearly lists all valid keywords, data types, and control structures, along with practical usage examples. This makes learning, troubleshooting, and implementing efficient code more challengingâ€”especially for new programmers or teams working across different vendors.

â¸»

ðŸŸ© A (Action)

Create a comprehensive, categorized reference document that includes:
	â€¢	All reserved keywords in Structured Text (ST), such as control structures (IF, CASE, FOR, WHILE, etc.)
	â€¢	Core data types (BOOL, INT, REAL, TIME, STRING, ARRAY, etc.)
	â€¢	Logical and arithmetic operators (AND, OR, MOD, NOT, +, -, etc.)
	â€¢	System constants and standard function blocks (TRUE, FALSE, TON, CTU, ABS, SQRT, etc.)
	â€¢	Code examples for commonly used constructs (e.g., how to use a timer, write a loop, or declare arrays)

â¸»

ðŸŸ¨ R (Result)

The result will be a clear, structured, and practical programming reference for IEC 61131-3 Structured Text, which:
	â€¢	Makes it faster and easier for developers to write compliant and efficient code
	â€¢	Serves as a daily reference tool for both new and experienced automation engineers
	â€¢	Helps reduce syntax errors, debugging time, and onboarding effort
	â€¢	Can be formatted as a PDF cheat sheet, a webpage, or even an IDE-integrated tooltip system

ðŸŸ¦ E (Example)

IF-THEN-ELSE syntax:

VAR
  Temp : REAL := 85.0;
  Overheat : BOOL;
END_VAR

IF Temp > 100.0 THEN
  Overheat := TRUE;
ELSE
  Overheat := FALSE;
END_IF;

TON (On-delay timer) function block:

VAR
  Timer1 : TON;
  Start  : BOOL;
END_VAR

Timer1(IN := Start, PT := T#5s);
IF Timer1.Q THEN
  // Execute action when timer completes
END_IF;

### IEC 61131-3 Structured Text Reference

#### 1. Control Structures
- **IF-THEN-ELSE**
  - Syntax: `IF condition THEN statement ELSE statement END_IF`
  - Example: `IF Temp > 100.0 THEN Overheat := TRUE; ELSE Overheat := FALSE; END_IF;`
