### Intent:
**Intent Summary:**  
Develop an IEC 61131-3 Structured Text program to automatically close a vessel's inlet valve when a high liquid level is detected (with fail-safe handling for faults), ensuring overfill protection until the level resets to a safe threshold.  

*(Focus: Safety interlock logic for level control with fault resilience.)*

### Prompt:
**Interlock Overfill Protection:**

Develop a self-contained IEC 61131-3 Structured Text program to implement an interlock system for overfill protection of a vessel. The program should utilize a level sensor to monitor the liquid level in the vessel and control an inlet valve to prevent overfilling.

The logic should ensure that the inlet valve automatically closes when the level sensor detects that the liquid has reached a predefined high-level setpoint. The interlock should remain engaged until the level drops below a safe threshold. Additionally, include a fail-safe mechanism to handle sensor failure or valve malfunction, ensuring the system defaults to a safe state. Discuss the importance of interlocks in industrial process safety and the role of overfill protection in preventing hazardous conditions.

**R-I-S-E:**

🟥 R (Role) – Your Role

Act as a PLC programmer or process control engineer responsible for implementing overfill protection in a vessel using IEC 61131-3 Structured Text to ensure safe, automatic operation in an industrial environment.

🟩 I (Input) – What You’re Given

You are tasked with creating a self-contained Structured Text program that:
	•	Uses a level sensor to monitor the liquid level in a vessel
	•	Controls an inlet valve to prevent overfilling
	•	Implements interlock logic based on safety thresholds
	•	Includes fail-safe handling in case of sensor or valve failure

Specific control conditions:
	•	Close the inlet valve if the level exceeds a high-level setpoint
	•	Keep the valve closed until the level falls below a reset threshold
	•	Default to a safe state (valve closed) if a sensor fault or valve fault is detected

⸻

🟧 S (Steps) – What You Need to Do
	1.	Define the variables and thresholds, including LevelSensor, HIGH_SETPOINT, RESET_THRESHOLD, SensorFault, ValveFault, and INLET_VALVE.
	2.	Implement interlock logic using Structured Text:
	•	Detect high-level condition and close the valve
	•	Latch the shutdown state until the level is safely below reset
	•	Monitor sensor/valve faults and trigger fail-safe action
	3.	Add logic for manual reset or alarm signaling, if needed, to meet process safety standards.
	4.	Comment and structure the code clearly for operational teams and future maintenance.

🟦 E (Expectation) – What Success Looks Like

You deliver a robust, self-resetting interlock that reliably prevents overfilling, even in the presence of equipment faults. The valve automatically closes on high level or fault detection and reopens only when the level returns to a safe zone. This system ensures process integrity, regulatory compliance, and equipment protection across a wide range of industrial applications.

The valve automatically closes on high level or fault detection and reopens only when the level returns to a safe zone. This system ensures process integrity, regulatory compliance, and equipment protection across a wide range of industrial applications.

**Additional Considerations:**

1.	**Safety Standards:** Ensure your program adheres to relevant safety standards, such as IEC 61508 (Functional Safety of Electrical/Electronic/Programmable Electronic Safety-related Systems) and IEC 61511 (Functional Safety - Safety Instrumented Systems for the Process Industry Sector).
2.	**Fault Detection and Diagnosis:** Implement a mechanism to detect and diagnose faults in the level sensor and inlet valve. This could involve monitoring sensor output, checking valve position, or using additional sensors for redundancy.
3.	**Fail-Safe Handling:** Design a fail-safe mechanism that defaults to a safe state (valve closed) in case of sensor or valve failure. This could involve using a backup sensor, a redundant valve, or a fail-safe timer to ensure the system does not remain in an unsafe state for an extended period.
4.	**Alarm Signaling:** Consider adding an alarm or notification system to alert operators of overfill conditions or equipment faults. This could involve triggering an audible alarm, sending a text message, or activating a visual indicator.
5.	**Manual Reset:** Provide a manual reset option to allow operators to override the interlock and reopen the valve in case of a false alarm or temporary fault. This should be a last resort and should be logged for audit purposes.
6.	**Documentation:** Comment your code thoroughly to explain the logic, thresholds, and safety features. Include a user manual or training materials to educate operators on how to use and maintain the system.
7.	**Testing and Validation:** Perform rigorous testing to validate the interlock's functionality, including testing for sensor and valve faults, manual reset, and alarm signaling. Document the test results and any modifications made during the testing process.
8.	**Integration:** Ensure your program can be easily integrated into an existing control system, with clear input/output points and communication protocols.
9.	**Future Scalability:** Design your program with scalability in mind, so it can be easily expanded or modified to accommodate different vessels, sensors, or control systems.
10.	**Environmental Considerations:** Take into account the environmental conditions in which the system will operate, such as temperature, humidity, and potential exposure to hazardous materials. Design the system to withstand these conditions and ensure it does not pose a risk to
