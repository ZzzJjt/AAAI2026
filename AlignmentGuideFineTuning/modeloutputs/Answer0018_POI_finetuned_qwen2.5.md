### Prompt:
**Model Predictive Control for Turbine Optimization in a Thermal Power Plant Using Python:**

Develop Python code to implement a model predictive control (MPC) algorithm for optimizing the operation of a turbine in a thermal power plant.

**B-A-B:**

ðŸŸ¥ Bï¼ˆBeforeï¼‰

Turbine operation in thermal power plants involves complex thermal dynamics, fluctuating load demands, and strict operational constraints. Traditional control methods often lack the ability to adapt in real time, resulting in suboptimal energy efficiency and unstable performance under disturbances.

Implement a model predictive control (MPC) system using Python that optimizes turbine performance by anticipating system behavior, improving energy efficiency, and maintaining stable operation under varying loads and external conditions.

ðŸŸ§ Bï¼ˆBridgeï¼‰

Use Python to model the thermal and dynamic behavior of the turbine, then develop an MPC algorithm that incorporates these dynamics along with real-time operational constraints. Simulate the turbineâ€™s response to changing load conditions and disturbances, demonstrating how MPC achieves more robust and efficient control compared to traditional approaches.
