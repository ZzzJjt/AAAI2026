ðŸŸ¥ T (Task) â€“ What You Need to Do

Design a self-contained IEC 61131-3 Structured Text function block that calculates the Poisson probability for a given number of discrete events based on a specified average rate (Î»).

â¸»

ðŸŸ© A (Action) â€“ How to Do It
	1.	Create a function block called PoissonProbability with the following structure:
	â€¢	Inputs:
	â€¢	Lambda : REAL â€” the expected mean number of events (Î»)
	â€¢	K : INT â€” the observed number of events
	â€¢	Output:
	â€¢	Probability : REAL â€” the result of the Poisson probability mass function
	2.	Implement the Poisson formula:
P(k; \lambda) = \frac{e^{-\lambda} \cdot \lambda^k}{k!}
	3.	Write Structured Text code that:
	â€¢	Uses EXP(-Lambda) and POW(Lambda, K)
	â€¢	Computes K! using a loop (since factorial is not built-in)
	â€¢	Handles edge cases (e.g., return 0.0 if K < 0 or Lambda <= 0)
	â€¢	Includes comments explaining:
	â€¢	Each part of the formula
	â€¢	Why and how factorial is computed
	â€¢	Numerical stability and PLC execution limits
	4.	Example snippet:

 IF (Lambda > 0.0) AND (K >= 0) THEN
    Factorial := 1.0;
    FOR i := 1 TO K DO
        Factorial := Factorial * i;
    END_FOR;
    Probability := EXP(-Lambda) * POW(Lambda, K) / Factorial;
ELSE
    Probability := 0.0;
END_IF;

ðŸŸ¦ G (Goal) â€“ What You Want to Achieve

Deliver a reliable, efficient, and reusable function block that:
	â€¢	Computes Poisson probabilities for use in real-time control systems
	â€¢	Enables PLCs to evaluate event likelihoods directly on the controller
	â€¢	Can be applied in scenarios like:
	â€¢	Predictive maintenance (e.g., faults per hour)
	â€¢	Sensor event modeling (e.g., number of triggers per cycle)
	â€¢	Queueing and flow rate prediction in production lines

This block helps integrate probabilistic reasoning into deterministic control logic while maintaining scan-time performance and accuracy.

### Function Block Overview

This function block is designed to compute the Poisson probability for a given mean (Î») and observed number of events (K). It is optimized for use in IEC 61131-3 Structured Text environments, where built-in mathematical functions are limited and factorial computation must be performed manually. The function block is self-contained, with a clear interface and internal logic that ensures accurate results while minimizing execution time.

### Key Features

1. **Input Validation**:
   - Ensures that Lambda (mean) and K (observed events) are non-negative to avoid invalid inputs.
   - Returns 0.0 if either input is invalid, ensuring safe operation in PLC environments.

2. **Factorial Computation**:
   - Uses a loop to compute the factorial of K.
   - Accommodates large values of K without overflowing or exhausting memory.

3. **Efficient Probability
