ðŸŸ© I (Input) â€“ Information Provided

The reactor operates by reacting ammonia and nitric acid in a controlled environment. Your control narrative must include:
	â€¢	Concrete setpoints and operational ranges for temperature, pressure, flow, and pH
	â€¢	A list of critical instrumentation and equipment (e.g., TICs, PICs, flow controllers, analyzers)
	â€¢	Normal startup, operation, and shutdown procedures

	â€¢	Temperature: 175â€¯Â°C (range: 173â€“177â€¯Â°C)
	â€¢	Pressure: 4.8â€¯bar (range: 4.6â€“5.0â€¯bar)
	â€¢	Flow ratio: Ammonia:Acid = 1.01:1
	â€¢	pH: 6.2 (acceptable range: 5.8â€“6.5)
	2.	List required instrumentation:
	â€¢	TIC-101 (reactor temperature controller)
	â€¢	PIC-102 (reactor pressure controller)
	â€¢	FIC-103/FIC-104 (ammonia/nitric acid flow controllers)
	â€¢	AIC-105 (pH analyzer)
	â€¢	LSH-106 (high-level switch for overfill protection)
	3.	Describe operating procedures:
	â€¢	Startup: Valve checks, initialize jacket heating, ramp up flows
	â€¢	Normal Operation: Maintain setpoints with PID loops; monitor pH and adjust feed as needed
	â€¢	Shutdown: Stop feeds, vent pressure, cool reactor, close all valves
	4.	Define interlocks and alarms:
	â€¢	ESD if Temp > 185â€¯Â°C, Pressure > 5.2â€¯bar, or pH < 5.5
	â€¢	Trigger alarms and lockout if ammonia or acid feed deviates Â±10% from target ratio

### Control Narrative for Ammonium Nitrate Reactor

#### Overview
The ammonium nitrate reactor is a continuous-flow reactor that produces ammonium nitrate by reacting ammonia and nitric acid in a controlled environment. The reactor operates at a fixed temperature and pressure, with precise flow ratios of ammonia to nitric acid. The process is monitored using a suite of instrumentation, and safety interlocks are in place to prevent overpressure, overheating, and off-spec product.

#### Setpoints and Operational Ranges

| Parameter       | Setpoint                 | Operational Range                 |
|-----------------|--------------------------|-----------------------------------|
| Temperature     | 175Â°C                    | 173Â°C to 177Â°C                   |
| Pressure        | 4.8 bar                  | 4.6 bar to 5.0 bar                |
| Flow Ratio       | 1.01:1                   | 0.95:1 to 1.05:1                 |
| pH              | 6.2                       | 5.8 to 6.5                       |
