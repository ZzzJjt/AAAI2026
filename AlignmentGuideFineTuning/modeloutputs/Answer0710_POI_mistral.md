### Intent:
"Implement a Python-based statistical process control system for steel manufacturing that monitors quality metrics, detects anomalies using control charts, triggers alarms, and suggests corrective actions, with simulated process data for demonstration."

### Prompt:
**Statistical Process Control for Steel Manufacturing Using Python:**

Develop Python code to implement a statistical process control (SPC) system for monitoring and optimizing the quality of steel manufacturing processes. The code should track key quality metrics such as tensile strength, thickness, and surface finish in real-time, using control charts and other SPC tools to detect and respond to process variations. Implement alarms for out-of-control conditions, and suggest corrective actions to minimize defects and ensure product consistency.

Simulate the steel manufacturing process, and demonstrate how SPC can be used to maintain high-quality production standards while minimizing waste and process variability.

**R-T-F:**

ðŸŸ© Tï¼ˆTaskï¼‰

Develop Python code to implement a statistical process control (SPC) system for monitoring and optimizing quality in steel manufacturing. The system should track key metrics such as tensile strength, thickness, and surface finish using control charts, detect out-of-control conditions, trigger alarms, and recommend corrective actions. Additionally, simulate the manufacturing process to demonstrate how SPC improves quality and reduces variability.

	â€¢	Alarm system with corresponding corrective action suggestions
	â€¢	Terminal or log output showing detection results and system responses (plots optional)

**Steps to Implement:**

1. Research and select appropriate SPC tools for monitoring key quality metrics in steel manufacturing (e.g., XÌ„, R, or S charts).
2. Simulate steel manufacturing process data for tensile strength, thickness, and surface finish.
3. Implement SPC tools in Python, including control limits, center lines, and calculation of moving averages and standard deviations.
4. Develop detection logic for out-of-control signals and rule violations, such as points outside the control limits or trends that exceed predefined thresholds.
5. Implement an alarm system that triggers when out-of-control signals or rule violations are detected.
6. Suggest corrective actions based on the type and severity of the detected issue.
7. Display detection results and system responses in the terminal or log output, with optional plots for visualization.
8. Test the SPC system with simulated data to ensure proper functioning and accuracy.
9. Document the code and provide clear instructions for use.

**Deliverables:**

1. Python script implementing the SPC system for steel manufacturing.
2. Simulated steel manufacturing process data for tensile strength, thickness, and surface finish.
3. Documentation outlining the SPC system's functionality, implementation details, and usage instructions.
4. Test results demonstrating the system's accuracy and effectiveness in detecting out-of-control conditions and suggesting corrective actions.
