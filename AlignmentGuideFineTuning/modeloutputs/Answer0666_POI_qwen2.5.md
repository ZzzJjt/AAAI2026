This function block implements a discrete-time Kalman filter for estimating the position and velocity of an autonomous vehicle. It takes measured position, process noise covariance (Q), measurement noise covariance (R), sample time (DeltaT), and a reset signal as inputs. The block internally stores the estimated position, velocity, previous position, error covariance, and Kalman gain.

The `Initialize` procedure sets the initial values for the estimated position, velocity, previous position, and error covariance. The `Predict` procedure predicts the new position based on the current velocity and updates the error covariance with the process noise covariance. The `Correct` procedure computes the Kalman gain, updates
