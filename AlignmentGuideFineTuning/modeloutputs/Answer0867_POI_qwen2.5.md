ðŸŸ¥ T (Task) â€“ What You Need to Do

Design a self-contained function block in IEC 61131-3 Structured Text that computes the natural logarithm of a given real input value. The block should be reusable, safe, and suitable for use in real-time industrial control systems.

ðŸŸ© A (Action) â€“ How to Do It
	1.	Create a function block named NaturalLog with:
	â€¢	Input:
	â€¢	X : REAL â€” the number to compute ln(X)
	â€¢	Outputs:
	â€¢	LnX : REAL â€” the result of ln(X)
	â€¢	Error : BOOL â€” set to TRUE if X â‰¤ 0, indicating an invalid input
	2.	Implement the logic:
	â€¢	Use the built-in LN() function for valid inputs:

 IF X > 0.0 THEN
    LnX := LN(X);
    Error := FALSE;
ELSE
    LnX := 0.0;
    Error := TRUE;
END_IF;

	â€¢	Add inline comments explaining:
	â€¢	ln(X) is undefined for X â‰¤ 0
	â€¢	Why Error is raised for domain violations
	â€¢	How the function is kept simple and deterministic for PLC use

	3.	Ensure compatibility and efficiency:
	â€¢	Avoid recursion or dynamic structures
	â€¢	Ensure all code executes predictably within a scan cycle
	â€¢	Optionally include versioning or diagnostic codes for system integration

ðŸŸ¦ G (Goal) â€“ What You Want to Achieve

Deliver a robust and reusable logarithm function block that:
	â€¢	Handles invalid input safely and predictably
	â€¢	Can be used in real-time PLC applications like:
	â€¢	Sensor signal scaling
	â€¢	Flow computation with exponential behavior
	â€¢	Energy modeling using logarithmic relationships
	â€¢	Provides clear feedback and documentation for system diagnostics and maintenance

**Sample Code:**

```structuredtext
FUNCTION_BLOCK NaturalLog
VAR_INPUT
    X : REAL;  -- Input number
END_VAR
VAR_OUTPUT
    LnX : REAL;  -- Natural logarithm of X
    Error : BOOL;  -- True if X â‰¤ 0
END_VAR

IF X > 0.0 THEN
    LnX := LN(X);
    Error := FALSE;
ELSE
    LnX := 0.0;
    Error := TRUE;
END_IF;
```

**Explanation:**

This function block computes the natural logarithm of a given real number `X`. It includes error handling for non-positive inputs, setting `Error` to `TRUE` and `LnX` to `0.0` in such cases. The function is designed to be efficient and deterministic, suitable for real-time industrial control systems. The comments within the code explain the mathematical foundation of the natural logarithm and the handling of edge cases, ensuring clarity and maintainability for system integrators and maintainers.
