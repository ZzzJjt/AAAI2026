### Intent:
**Intent Summary:**  
Develop an ISA-88-compliant batch control program in IEC 61131-3 Structured Text for aspirin production, automating reaction, crystallization, centrifugation, and drying phases with precise temperature/time parameters and modular phase transitions.  

*(Focus: Code generation for sequential batch control with ISA-88 structure, targeting reactor/crystallizer/dryer equipment.)*

### Prompt:
**Batch Aspirin:**

Develop an ISA-88 batch control recipe for the production of aspirin (acetylsalicylic acid), outlining the process stages and the physical structure, which includes a reactor, crystallizer, centrifuge, and dryer. The process involves the following educts: acetic anhydride, salicylic acid, and sulfuric acid as a catalyst, with products being acetylsalicylic acid and acetic acid. The drying stage should occur at 90°C.

Write a self-contained program in IEC 61131-3 Structured Text for the sequential control of the reaction stage, incorporating typical parameter values for temperature, pressure, and timing. Ensure that the program logic follows the batch control principles of ISA-88, with clear transitions between operations like heating, mixing, and reaction completion. Additionally, include control parameters for initiating and managing the crystallization and drying phases, ensuring that temperature and time controls are accurate.

**B-A-B:**

🟥 B (Before) – The Problem or Challenge

Aspirin (acetylsalicylic acid) production is a multi-step batch process involving chemical reactions, crystallization, separation, and drying. Without a structured batch control strategy, managing these phases—especially with temperature-sensitive reactions and equipment like reactors, centrifuges, and dryers—can lead to inefficiencies, inconsistencies in product quality, and difficulty scaling or maintaining the control system.

🟩 A (After) – The Desired Outcome

Design an ISA-88-compliant batch control recipe for aspirin production that clearly defines the process stages and equipment used (reactor, crystallizer, centrifuge, dryer). Develop a self-contained IEC 61131-3 Structured Text program for controlling the reaction stage, using typical parameter values for temperature, pressure, and timing. Extend the logic to include control parameters for crystallization and drying, such as accurate temperature regulation (e.g., 90°C in the drying phase) and phase transitions that reflect best practices in batch control.

🟧 B (Bridge) – How to Get There

Start by outlining the full batch process structure, including input educts (acetic anhydride, salicylic acid, sulfuric acid) and output products (acetylsalicylic acid and acetic acid). Implement the reaction stage control logic in Structured Text using ISA-88 principles—modular design, clear phase transitions, and parameter-based sequencing (e.g., heating to target temperature, maintaining reaction conditions, detecting completion). Then add Structured Text logic blocks for crystallization and drying, ensuring precise temperature and time control with appropriate method calls or function blocks. Maintain clear documentation to support modularity and system scalability.
