### Intent:
**Intent Summary:**  
Develop a C function block wrapped in IEC 61131-3 Structured Text to create and manage OPC UA subscriptions using Open62541, enabling dynamic configuration (e.g., publishing intervals) and robust error handling for real-time PLC-server communication.  

*(Focus: Integration of Open62541 with PLC logic for subscription management, emphasizing inputs/outputs, error handling, and dynamic adjustments.)*

### Prompt:
**OPC UA Subscription Creation Using Open62541 and IEC 61131-3 Structured Text:**

Develop a C function block for OPC UA subscription creation using the Open62541 library, which will be wrapped in IEC 61131-3 structured text code. The function block receives a Connection Handle as a DWORD and has the following inputs: an executed flag (BOOL), a priority (BYTE), and a timeout (TIME). As outputs, it provides three status flags (Done, Busy, Error) along with two DWORD outputs (ErrorID, SubscriptionHdl). The function block also includes an IN/OUT variable PublishingInterval (type TIME), which allows dynamic adjustment of the subscription interval.

In your explanation, describe how this C function block can be wrapped inside IEC 61131-3 structured text code, highlighting the integration steps and providing an example of how to call the function block within an ST program. Discuss error handling, subscription management, and real-time communication with OPC UA servers.

**B-A-B:**

ðŸŸ¥ B (Before) â€“ The Challenge

Creating OPC UA subscriptions from within an IEC 61131-3 PLC environment is not natively supported and typically requires external integration through C libraries. Without a clean interface, managing real-time updates, adjusting publishing intervals, and handling connection states or errors can become complex and error-proneâ€”especially when trying to maintain deterministic control behavior in industrial systems.

ðŸŸ© A (After) â€“ The Ideal Outcome

Develop a C function block for OPC UA subscription creation using the open62541 library, which can be wrapped inside IEC 61131-3 Structured Text. This function block takes the following inputs:
	â€¢	ConnectionHdl (DWORD) â€“ The OPC UA session handle
	â€¢	Execute (BOOL) â€“ Triggers subscription creation
	â€¢	Priority (BYTE) â€“ Sets the subscription priority
	â€¢	Timeout (TIME) â€“ Defines how long the block waits before returning an error
	â€¢	PublishingInterval (IN/OUT, TIME) â€“ Dynamically adjusts the interval of data updates

It returns:
	â€¢	Done (BOOL) â€“ Set when the subscription is successfully created
	â€¢	Busy (BOOL) â€“ Set while the creation is in progress
	â€¢	Error (BOOL) â€“ Set if the process fails
	â€¢	ErrorID (DWORD) â€“ Provides a failure reason
	â€¢	SubscriptionHdl (DWORD) â€“ Returns the handle for the created subscription

â¸»

ðŸŸ§ B (Bridge) â€“ The Implementation Strategy

Write the subscription creation logic in C using open62541â€™s client API, including functions for setting the publishing interval, monitoring priority, and managing connection state using the provided session handle. Export this C logic as a callable interface (e.g., dynamic or static linked function) and wrap it in an IEC 61131-3 Structured Text function block.

In the ST layer:
	â€¢	Use rising edge detection on Execute
	â€¢	Handle cyclic polling through the Busy flag
	â€¢	Update PublishingInterval if needed before triggering the C interface
	â€¢	Return Done or Error once the process completes or times out
	â€¢	Store the SubscriptionHdl for use in future read/write calls

For example, in an ST program:

SubscribeFB(
    Execute := TRUE,
    ConnectionHdl := SessionHandle,
    Priority := 1,
    Timeout := T#5s,
    PublishingInterval := MyInterval,
    Done => SubscribeDone,
    Busy => SubscribeBusy,
    Error => SubscribeError,
    ErrorID => SubscribeErrorID,
    SubscriptionHdl => MySubscription
);

This structure provides a clean, modular way to manage OPC UA subscriptions in real time with dynamic configuration and robust error reportingâ€”bridging high-performance C logic with industrial PLC logic seamlessly.
