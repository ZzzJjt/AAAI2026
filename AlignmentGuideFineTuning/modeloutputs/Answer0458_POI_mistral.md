### Intent:
**Intent Summary:**  
Develop a C function block for OPC UA subscription management using Open62541, wrapped in IEC 61131-3 Structured Text, to enable PLCs to dynamically create and monitor subscriptions with real-time error handling and adjustable publishing intervals.  

*(Focus: Integration of OPC UA client functionality into PLC logic for deterministic industrial communication.)*

### Prompt:
**OPC UA Subscription Creation Using Open62541 and IEC 61131-3 Structured Text:**

Develop a C function block for OPC UA subscription creation using the Open62541 library, which will be wrapped in IEC 61131-3 structured text code. The function block receives a Connection Handle as a DWORD and has the following inputs: an executed flag (BOOL), a priority (BYTE), and a timeout (TIME). As outputs, it provides three status flags (Done, Busy, Error) along with two DWORD outputs (ErrorID, SubscriptionHdl). The function block also includes an IN/OUT variable PublishingInterval (type TIME), which allows dynamic adjustment of the subscription interval.

In your explanation, describe how this C function block can be wrapped inside IEC 61131-3 structured text code, highlighting the integration steps and providing an example of how to call the function block within an ST program. Discuss error handling, subscription management, and real-time communication with OPC UA servers.

**R-I-S-E:**

🟥 R (Role) – Your Role

Act as an automation engineer integrating C-based OPC UA functionality into an IEC 61131-3 environment to enable real-time subscription handling in PLC programs.

⸻

🟩 I (Input) – What You’re Given

You are developing a C function block using the open62541 OPC UA client library. This function block must support OPC UA subscription creation, and be callable from an IEC 61131-3 Structured Text (ST) environment. The function block interface includes:

Inputs:
	•	Execute (BOOL): Initiates the subscription
	•	ConnectionHdl (DWORD): OPC UA session handle
	•	Priority (BYTE): Subscription priority
	•	Timeout (TIME): Max wait time for response
	•	PublishingInterval (IN/OUT, TIME): Interval for data updates (adjustable at runtime)

Outputs:
	•	Done (BOOL): Indicates successful subscription
	•	Busy (BOOL): Operation in progress
	•	Error (BOOL): Subscription failed
	•	ErrorID (DWORD): Diagnostic error code
	•	SubscriptionHdl (DWORD): Output handle for managing the subscription

⸻

🟧 S (Steps) – What to Do
	1.	Write the C function block using open62541 to create a subscription, configure its priority and publishing interval, and return a handle to the caller.
	2.	Wrap the C code into a callable module or external function that is accessible from the ST environment.
	3.	Implement an ST function block wrapper that triggers the C function on a rising edge of Execute, tracks the connection state using Busy, and sets Done or Error flags upon completion.
	4.	Ensure robust error handling, including timeouts, invalid handles, and communication errors, and propagate error codes back to the ST layer via ErrorID.
	5.	Document the integration, showing how to instantiate and use the function block within a PLC cycle.

⸻

🟦 E (Expectation) – What Success Looks Like

The final solution enables PLC programs to reliably create and manage OPC UA subscriptions in real time. The PublishingInterval can be adjusted dynamically, and the PLC receives clear status feedback on the subscription state. This bridges modern OPC UA capabilities with deterministic PLC control logic, enabling high-performance data communication and system scalability.

The final solution enables PLC programs to reliably create and manage OPC UA subscriptions in real time. The PublishingInterval can be adjusted dynamically, and the PLC receives clear status feedback on the subscription state. This bridges modern OPC UA capabilities with deterministic PLC control logic, enabling high-performance data communication and system scalability.

**Example ST Program:**

```st
PROGRAM Main
VAR
	SubscriptionHdl: DWORD;
	ErrorID: DWORD;
	Done, Busy, Error: BOOL;
	PublishingInterval: TIME;
	ConnectionHdl: DWORD;
	Priority: BYTE;
	Timeout: TIME;
	Subscription: OPC_UA_SUBSCRIPTION;
	SubscriptionMon: OPC_UA_SUBSCRIPTION_MONITOR;
	SubscriptionCb: OPC_UA_SUBSCRIPTION_CALLBACK;
BEGIN
	// Initialize OPC UA client and connection
	// ...

	// Set connection handle, priority, timeout, and initial interval
	ConnectionHdl := 12345;
	Priority := 1;
	Timeout := T#100ms;
	PublishingInterval := T#1s;

	// Call the OPC UA subscription function block
	OPC_UA_SUBSCRIBE(ConnectionHdl, Execute, Done, Busy, Error, ErrorID, SubscriptionHdl, PublishingInterval);

	// Monitor the subscription status
	REPEAT
		IF NOT Busy THEN
			IF NOT Done THEN
				// Check for errors and handle them accordingly
				IF Error THEN
					// Log error and take appropriate action
					// ...
				END_IF
			END_IF
		END_IF

		// Update the subscription interval if needed
		IF Changed(PublishingInterval) THEN
			// Update the subscription interval in the OPC UA client
			// ...
		END_IF

		// Wait for the next PLC cycle
		WAIT(1);
	END_REPEAT

	// Clean up OPC UA resources
	// ...
END_PROGRAM
```

**Note:**

This example assumes that the OPC UA subscription function block has been properly implemented and wrapped in an ST function block wrapper. The OPC UA client initialization, connection management, and other necessary steps are not shown here.
