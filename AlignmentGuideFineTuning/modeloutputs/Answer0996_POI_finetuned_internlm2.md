### Intent:
**Intent Summary:**  
Create an IEC 61131-3 Function Block Diagram (FBD) in ASCII art to represent a feedwater control loop with an analog input (AI), TON timer, PID controller, and analog output (AO), showing signal flow from AI to PID to AO for PLC documentation or training purposes.  

*(Focus: Text-based FBD generation for a PID control loop with timed activation, emphasizing clarity and adherence to IEC 61131-3 standards.)*
