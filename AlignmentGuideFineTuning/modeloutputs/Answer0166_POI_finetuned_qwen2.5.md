### Intent:
**Intent Summary:**  
Create a self-contained, iterative heapsort function block in IEC 61131-3 Structured Text for PLCs to efficiently sort integer arrays in-place without recursion or advanced language features.  

*(Focus: Non-recursive, scan-cycle-safe sorting for industrial automation.)*

### Prompt:
**Kalman Filter:**
Implement a self-contained function block in IEC 61131-3 structured text to create a Kalman filter for estimating the position and velocity of an autonomous transport vehicle. Include configurable parameters for noise covariance and initial conditions.

**B-A-B:**

üü• B (Before) ‚Äì The Problem or Challenge

In industrial automation and autonomous systems, estimating the position and velocity of a moving vehicle is crucial for navigation, control, and safety. However, raw sensor data (e.g., from encoders or GPS) often contains noise and uncertainty, which can lead to unstable or inaccurate control decisions. Without a proper filtering mechanism like a Kalman filter, it becomes difficult to derive smooth and reliable estimates in real time, especially on a PLC that lacks native matrix and recursive math libraries.
