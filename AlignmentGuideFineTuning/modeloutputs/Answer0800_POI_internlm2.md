### Intent:
**Intent Summary:**  
Create an IEC 61131-3 compliant Sequential Function Chart (SFC) in ASCII art for a cyclic traffic light system with timed transitions (Green: 5s â†’ Yellow: 2s â†’ Red: 5s â†’ loop).

### Prompt:
**SFC Traffic Light:**

Create a 61131-3 sequential function chart in ASCII art for a traffic light. Include proper delays for switching the lights.

**R-T-F:**

ðŸŸ¥ R (Role) â€“ Define Your Role

Act as a control systems engineer responsible for designing and documenting a Sequential Function Chart (SFC) for a traffic light system in compliance with IEC 61131-3.

â¸»

ðŸŸ© T (Task) â€“ Define the Objective

Create an ASCII-based SFC diagram for a traffic light that includes:
	â€¢	Three sequential steps: Green, Yellow, and Red
	â€¢	A TON (on-delay) timer at each step to define its duration:
	â€¢	Green for 5 seconds
	â€¢	Yellow for 2 seconds
	â€¢	Red for 5 seconds
	â€¢	Transitions between steps based on each timerâ€™s .Q output
	â€¢	A clear loop that cycles continuously from Red back to Green

â¸»

ðŸŸ§ F (Format) â€“ Specify the Output Format

Present the SFC in plain ASCII art, using:
	â€¢	Boxes or labels to represent steps
	â€¢	Arrows (-->) or downward flow to indicate transitions
	â€¢	Timer function blocks and conditions next to each step
	â€¢	Optional: clearly label the SFC loop to show full cycle logic

Example:

[Step: Green Light]
   TON tGreen (PT := T#5s)
        |
        V (tGreen.Q)
[Step: Yellow Light]
   TON tYellow (PT := T#2s)
        |
        V (tYellow.Q)
[Step: Red Light]
   TON tRed (PT := T#5s)
        |
        V (tRed.Q)
--> Loop to Green

ðŸŸ¥ R (Role) â€“ Define Your Role

As a control systems engineer, your role is to design and document a Sequential Function Chart (SFC) for a traffic light system in compliance with IEC 61131-3. This includes creating an ASCII-based SFC diagram that meets the specified requirements.

â¸»

ðŸŸ© T (Task) â€“ Define the Objective

The objective of this task is to create an ASCII-based SFC diagram for a traffic light system that includes three sequential steps: Green, Yellow, and Red. Each step should have a TON (on-delay) timer to define its duration, with the following specifications:

- Green: 5 seconds
- Yellow: 2 seconds
- Red: 5 seconds

The transitions between steps should be based on each timer's .Q output, and the SFC should have a clear loop that cycles continuously from Red back to Green.

ðŸŸ§ F (Format) â€“ Specify the Output Format

The SFC should be presented in plain ASCII art, using the following elements:

- Boxes or labels to represent steps
- Arrows (-->) or downward flow to indicate transitions
- Timer function blocks and conditions next to each step
- Optional: clearly label the SFC loop to show full cycle logic

Example:

[Step: Green Light]
   TON tGreen (PT := T#5s)
        |
        V (tGreen.Q)
[Step: Yellow Light]
   TON tYellow (PT := T#2s)
        |
        V (tYellow.Q)
[Step: Red Light]
   TON tRed (PT := T#5s)
        |
        V (tRed.Q)
--> Loop to Green Light
