### Intent:
**Intent Summary:**  
Develop an ISA-88-compliant batch control program in IEC 61131-3 Structured Text to manage the reaction phase (B.2) of adhesive production, including heating (85Â°C), mixing (600 RPM), and holding (20 min) with modular methods, state transitions, and fault handling.  

*(Focus: Precise phase control, timer/condition-based transitions, and ISA-88 modularity for adhesive batch processing.)*

### Prompt:
**Batch Adhesive:**

Develop an ISA-88 batch control recipe for the production of adhesive, detailing the stages involved in the process. Create a self-contained program in IEC 61131-3 Structured Text to manage the sequential control of step B.2, Reaction, with specific process parameters and timers. Include the necessary control logic to call methods corresponding to each phase of the reaction, ensuring that transitions between steps are managed through appropriate conditions and timer values.

Incorporate detailed content for calling the methods that govern specific operations, such as heating, mixing, and maintaining the reaction environment. Additionally, discuss the integration of ISA-88 standards in batch process control, focusing on how the structured text program facilitates modularity and flexibility in controlling the adhesive production process.

**C-A-R-E:**

ðŸŸ¥ C (Context) â€“ Background Situation

Adhesive production is typically carried out in batch mode and involves multiple well-defined stages, including a critical reaction phase where variables such as temperature, mixing intensity, and duration must be precisely controlled. Implementing ISA-88 standards ensures modularity and reusability in batch control systems, especially when programmed using IEC 61131-3 Structured Text.

ðŸŸ© A (Action) â€“ Task to Perform

Develop an ISA-88 batch control recipe for adhesive production, detailing each stage of the process. Focus on implementing step B.2: Reaction as a self-contained program in Structured Text, complete with process parameters, timers, and logic for transitioning between sub-steps. Create structured method calls to handle key operations such as heating, mixing, and maintaining the reaction environment, and design the control logic to manage phase transitions based on real-time conditions and timer values.

ðŸŸ¨ R (Result) â€“ Expected Outcome

The program should reflect ISA-88 principles by being modular, maintainable, and reusable. Each phase of the reaction should be clearly defined, and the structured code should ensure reliable execution of the batch step with accurate parameter tracking and safe sequencing of operations.

ðŸŸ¦ E (Example) â€“ Concrete Illustration

For instance, during the B.2 Reaction step, the program might call StartHeating(Temp := 85) and begin a timer; once the timer expires and temperature is stable, it could invoke StartMixing(Speed := 600) for a set duration, followed by HoldReaction(Time := 20 min). Transitions between phases are managed using IF conditions and timers, ensuring strict adherence to the recipe logic.

**Implementation:**

1. Define the necessary variables and constants for the reaction phase, including temperature, speed, time, and timers.

```
VAR
  ReactionTemperature : INT;
  ReactionSpeed : INT;
  ReactionTime : TON;
  HeatingTimer : TON;
  MixingTimer : TON;
END_VAR

CONST
  ReactionTemperatureSetPoint : INT := 85;
  ReactionSpeedSetPoint : INT := 600;
  ReactionTimeSetPoint : TIME := T#20m;
END_VAR
```

2. Create a method for each phase of the reaction, including heating, mixing, and holding.

```
FUNCTION_BLOCK Heating
  // Implement logic to heat the adhesive to the desired temperature
END_FUNCTION_BLOCK

FUNCTION_BLOCK Mixing
  // Implement logic to mix the adhesive at the desired speed
END_FUNCTION_BLOCK

FUNCTION_BLOCK Holding
  // Implement logic to maintain the reaction environment during the holding phase
END_FUNCTION_BLOCK
```

3. Develop the main control logic for the reaction phase, incorporating state transitions and fault handling.

```
PROGRAM ReactionControl
  // Initialize variables and timers
  ReactionTemperature := 0;
  ReactionSpeed := 0;
  ReactionTime := FALSE;
  HeatingTimer := FALSE;
  MixingTimer := FALSE;

  // Main control loop
  WHILE TRUE DO
    // Check if the reaction phase has started
    IF NOT ReactionTime THEN
      // Start heating the adhesive
      HeatingTimer := TRUE;
      Heating();
    ELSIF HeatingTimer AND ReactionTemperature = ReactionTemperatureSetPoint THEN
      // Start mixing the adhesive
      MixingTimer := TRUE;
      Mixing();
    ELSIF MixingTimer AND NOT MixingTimer.Q THEN
      // End mixing and start holding the reaction
      MixingTimer := FALSE;
      ReactionTime := TRUE;
      Holding();
    ELSIF ReactionTime AND ReactionTime.Q THEN
      // End the reaction phase
      ReactionTime :=
