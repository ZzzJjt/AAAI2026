### Intent:
**Intent Summary:**  
Generate a structured I/O list for feedwater control in a steam-water cycle, detailing 30 critical analog/digital signals (e.g., flow, pressure, temperature) with tags, ranges, setpoints, and P&ID references to support PLC/HMI configuration and process documentation.  

*(Focus: Automation of signal mapping for control system integration.)*

### Prompt:
**FBD PID:**

Create a 61131-3 function block diagram in ASCII art. It shall contain an analog input, a timer block, and a PID block as well as an analog output. The analog input feeds both the timer and the PID block. Only the PID block is connected to the analog output. Provide typical input and output signals for each function block and show them inside each block.

**B-A-B:**

ðŸŸ¥ B (Before) â€“ The Problem or Challenge

Designing and visualizing function block diagrams (FBD) in IEC 61131-3 can be difficult in plain-text environments without access to graphical editors. This becomes especially limiting when trying to convey the interaction between key blocks such as analog inputs, PID controllers, and timersâ€”particularly when communicating signal flow, I/O parameters, and control logic during early-stage design or documentation reviews.

â¸»

ðŸŸ© A (After) â€“ The Desired Outcome

Create a 61131-3-compliant FBD layout using ASCII art that includes the following components:
	â€¢	An analog input block
	â€¢	A timer block
	â€¢	A PID block
	â€¢	An analog output block

Ensure the analog input feeds both the timer and the PID block, and that only the PID output connects to the analog output. Clearly show typical input and output signal names within each block (e.g., IN, OUT, PV, SP, CV, ET, etc.), using a readable, text-based diagram format.

ðŸŸ§ B (Bridge) â€“ How to Get There
	1.	Use ASCII characters to draw blocks (e.g., +----+) and wires (---->).
	2.	Label each block clearly:
	â€¢	Analog Input with output AI_Value
	â€¢	TON Timer with IN, ET, and Q
	â€¢	PID Block with PV, SP, and CV
	â€¢	Analog Output driven by CV
	3.	Show connections such as:
	â€¢	AI_Value â†’ TON.IN
	â€¢	AI_Value â†’ PID.PV
	â€¢	PID.CV â†’ Analog Output.IN
	4.	Place signal names inside or beside each block for clarity.
	5.	Make sure the diagram is compact and easy to understand in a code editor or documentation file.

**R-I-S-E:**

ðŸŸ¥ R (Role) â€“ Your Role

You are a PLC programmer or automation engineer responsible for designing and documenting control logic using IEC 61131-3 function block diagrams in environments where graphical tools are unavailable.

â¸»

ðŸŸ© I (Input) â€“ What Youâ€™re Given

You need to create a basic control loop involving an analog input, a timer, a PID controller, and an analog output. The intent is to show how these elements are connected and how signals flow through the system. You are working in a text-based environment, such as a code editor or early-stage documentation.

ðŸŸ§ S (Steps) â€“ How to Do It

	1.	Define the function blocks:
	â€¢	Analog Input (AI)
	â€¢	Timer (TON)
	â€¢	PID Controller (PID)
	â€¢	Analog Output (AO)
	2.	Represent each block using ASCII characters:
	â€¢	Analog Input: +----+
	â€¢	Timer: +----[T]----+
	â€¢	PID: +----[PID]----+
	â€¢	Analog Output: +----+
	3.	Connect the blocks with arrows to indicate signal flow:
	â€¢	AI â†’ TON
	â€¢	AI â†’ PID
	â€¢	PID â†’ AO
	4.	Include signal names inside or near each block:
	â€¢	Analog Input: AI_Value
	â€¢	Timer: ET, Q
	â€¢	PID: PV, SP, CV
	â€¢	Analog Output: IN
	5.	Ensure the layout is clear and the signal flow is unambiguous.
