### Intent:
**Intent Summary:**  
Develop an ISA-88-compliant Structured Text program to automate the sequenced startup of a paper machine press section, including speed ramping, temperature regulation, pressure control, and synchronization, with fault handling and safety checks.  

*(Focus: Batch process control for industrial machinery, emphasizing modularity, safety, and phased transitions.)*

### Prompt:
**Batch Adhesive:**

Develop an ISA-88 batch control recipe for the production of adhesive, detailing the stages involved in the process. Create a self-contained program in IEC 61131-3 Structured Text to manage the sequential control of step B.2, Reaction, with specific process parameters and timers. Include the necessary control logic to call methods corresponding to each phase of the reaction, ensuring that transitions between steps are managed through appropriate conditions and timer values.

Incorporate detailed content for calling the methods that govern specific operations, such as heating, mixing, and maintaining the reaction environment. Additionally, discuss the integration of ISA-88 standards in batch process control, focusing on how the structured text program facilitates modularity and flexibility in controlling the adhesive production process.

**T-A-G:**

游린 T (Task)

Develop an ISA-88-compliant batch control recipe for the production of adhesive, focusing on step B.2: Reaction.

游릴 A (Action)

Implement a self-contained Structured Text program in IEC 61131-3 that manages the sequential execution of the Reaction step. Define process parameters and timers for each phase of the reaction, and include logic to call modular methods such as StartHeating, StartMixing, and HoldReaction. Use conditional checks and timer values to control transitions between these phases. Ensure the code structure is modular and maintainable, in alignment with ISA-88 principles.

游릱 G (Goal)

Create a reliable, modular, and flexible control program that supports precise execution of the Reaction phase in adhesive production. The result should improve maintainability, enable reuse across similar batch processes, and ensure compliance with ISA-88 standards for batch control architecture.
