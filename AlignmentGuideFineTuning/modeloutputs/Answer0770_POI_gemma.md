### Intent:
**Intent Summary:**  
Translate a Structured Text (ST) program for a pick-and-place system with manual/auto mode control, sensor inputs, actuator outputs, and timing logic into equivalent Instruction List (IL) code while preserving all functionality.

### Prompt:
**Translate ST To Instruction List:**

Translate the following 61131-3 Structured Text program to 61131-3 Instruction List: PROGRAM PickAndPlace VAR ManualButton : BOOL; // Input signal for manual mode AutoButton : BOOL; // Input signal for auto mode ClipButton : BOOL; // Input signal for clip action TransferButton : BOOL; // Input signal for transfer action ReleaseButton : BOOL; // Input signal for release action ConveyorA : BOOL; // Input signal for presence of product on conveyor A ConveyorB : BOOL; // Output signal to control conveyor B RoboticArm : BOOL; // Output signal to control the robotic arm Mode : INT := 0; // Internal variable to store the current mode (0 = manual, 1 = auto) AutoProcess : BOOL := FALSE; // Internal variable to store whether the auto control process is currently running END_VAR

// Manual mode control process IF ManualButton THEN Mode := 0; // Set mode to manual END_IF

IF Mode = 0 THEN // Manual mode IF ClipButton AND ConveyorA THEN RoboticArm := TRUE; // Clip the product ELSIF TransferButton THEN ConveyorB := TRUE; // Transfer the product to conveyor B ELSIF ReleaseButton THEN ConveyorB := FALSE; // Release the product from conveyor B END_IF END_IF

// Auto mode control process IF AutoButton THEN Mode := 1; // Set mode to auto END_IF

IF Mode = 1 THEN // Auto mode IF NOT AutoProcess AND ConveyorA THEN // Only start the process if not currently running and there is a product on conveyor A AutoProcess := TRUE; // Set flag to indicate that the auto process is running RoboticArm := TRUE; // Clip the product WAIT 2; // Wait for 2 seconds to transfer the product ConveyorB := TRUE; // Transfer the product to conveyor B END_IF IF ConveyorB AND NOT ConveyorA THEN // Release the product from conveyor B once it has been transferred and there is no product on conveyor A ConveyorB := FALSE; AutoProcess := FALSE; // Clear the flag to indicate that the auto process is not running END_IF END_IF

ðŸŸ¥ R (Role) â€“ Define Your Role

Act as a control systems programmer skilled in IEC 61131-3 programming languages, with a focus on translating between Structured Text (ST) and Instruction List (IL).

ðŸŸ© T (Task) â€“ Define the Objective

Translate a complete Structured Text (ST) program named PickAndPlace into its equivalent Instruction List (IL) representation. The program includes input/output variables, manual and automatic control logic, mode switching, conditional checks (IF, ELSIF), a process flag, and a time delay (WAIT). Your translation should preserve all control logic and be compliant with IL syntax.

ðŸŸ§ F (Format) â€“ Specify the Output Format

Provide a clean, line-by-line Instruction List (IL) version of the original ST program, using appropriate IL instructions such as LD, ST, AND, JMPC, JMP, and labels. Include comments for readability where necessary and simulate the WAIT instruction using counters or available timer logic compatible with IL.
