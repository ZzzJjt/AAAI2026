### Intent:
**Intent Summary:**  
Develop a feedforward control program in IEC 61131-3 Structured Text to adjust conveyor speed preemptively based on predicted load input, ensuring efficient operation within defined speed limits.

### Prompt:
**PID pH Control:**

Develop a self-contained IEC 61131-3 Structured Text program (not a function block) to implement PID feedback control for pH regulation in a process. The program should continuously adjust the addition of acid or base to maintain the pH setpoint, ensuring accurate control in dynamic conditions.

Include the PID parameters (proportional, integral, and derivative gains) and the control logic to handle deviations from the target pH. The program should incorporate safeguards to prevent extreme pH levels by setting operational limits for the dosing mechanism. Discuss the challenges of pH control in industrial processes, particularly focusing on system response time, non-linear behavior of pH control, and maintaining process stability under varying input conditions.

**C-A-R-E:**

ðŸŸ¥ C (Context) â€“ The Background

In industrial chemical processes, pH regulation is a delicate and nonlinear control challenge. Especially near neutral pH (7.0), small amounts of acid or base can cause large pH swings. Failing to maintain stable pH can result in corrosion, product inconsistencies, or process failures. A reliable PID control system is necessary to provide stable and precise dosing of acid or base in response to fluctuations.

ðŸŸ© A (Action) â€“ What to Implement

Develop a self-contained IEC 61131-3 Structured Text program (not a function block) that:
	â€¢	Continuously monitors pH_PV (measured pH value)

**Feedforward Control Conveyor:**

Develop a self-contained IEC 61131-3 Structured Text program (not a function block) to implement feedforward control for adjusting the speed of a conveyor belt based on predicted load input. The program should predict the load based on input signals and adjust the conveyor speed accordingly to maintain optimal throughput while ensuring that the speed remains within specified operational limits.
