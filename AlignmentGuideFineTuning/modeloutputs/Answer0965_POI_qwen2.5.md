### Intent:
The task is to create an IEC 61131-3 structured text function block that implements an iterative heapsort algorithm for integer arrays without recursion or DOWNTO loops, ensuring efficient in-place sorting with clear status outputs for PLC integration.

### Prompt:
**Heapsort:**
Implement a self-contained function block in IEC 61131-3 structured text to perform the heapsort algorithm on an array of integers without using recursion or the â€˜DOWNTOâ€™ keyword in loops. Ensure efficient heap construction and sorting.

**T-A-G:**

ðŸŸ¥ T (Task)

Implement a self-contained function block in IEC 61131-3 Structured Text that performs the heapsort algorithm on an array of integers.

â¸»

ðŸŸ© A (Action)
	â€¢	Design the function block to sort an integer array in place, without requiring additional memory.
	â€¢	Use iterative loops only â€” avoid recursion to ensure scan-cycle compatibility.
	â€¢	Replace any use of the DOWNTO keyword with ascending loops and calculated index logic.
	â€¢	Implement two main phases:
	1.	Heap construction: convert the array into a valid max-heap.
	2.	Sorting: repeatedly extract the largest element, swap, and restore the heap property.
	â€¢	Include status outputs like Done : BOOL and clearly comment the heapify logic, loop flow, and index tracking.

â¸»

ðŸŸ¦ G (Goal)

Deliver a reliable, efficient, and standards-compliant sorting block that integrates seamlessly into PLC projects. The function block should execute safely under typical PLC scan cycles, respect IEC 61131-3 syntax limitations, and be easily reusable in any sorting-related automation task.

**Function Block: Heapsort**

```structuredtext
// Heapsort Function Block
// Sorts an array of integers in place using the heapsort algorithm
// without recursion or the 'DOWNTO' keyword.

// Inputs:
//   arr : ARRAY[0..n-1] OF INT - The array to be sorted
//   n   : INT - The number of elements in the array

// Outputs:
//   Done : BOOL - Indicates when the sorting is complete

// Status Outputs:
//   HeapifyStatus : BOOL - Indicates the status of heapify operations
//   SwapStatus    : BOOL - Indicates the status of swap operations

// Constants:
CONST
  MAX_ITERATIONS : INT := 1000; // Maximum iterations for safety
