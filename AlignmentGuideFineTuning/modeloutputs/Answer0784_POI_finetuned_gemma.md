### Intent:
**Intent Summary:**  
Create a reusable IEC 61131-3 Structured Text function block to convert Fahrenheit to Celsius with input validation (rejecting values below absolute zero) and a validity flag, ensuring industrial robustness and scan-cycle efficiency.  

*(Focus: Precision conversion, safety checks, and industrial compatibility.)*

### Prompt:
**Fahrenheit to Celsius:**
Implement a self-contained function block in IEC 61131-3 structured text to convert Fahrenheit to Celsius. Ensure it handles input validation and provides accurate results.

**R-T-F:**

ðŸŸ¥ R (Role) â€“ Define Your Role

Act as a PLC engineer responsible for building utility function blocks in IEC 61131-3 Structured Text for use in industrial temperature control systems.

â¸»

ðŸŸ© T (Task) â€“ Define the Objective

Develop a self-contained function block that converts a Fahrenheit temperature value to Celsius, ensuring:
	â€¢	Accurate conversion using the formula:
Celsius = (Fahrenheit - 32) \times \frac{5}{9}
	â€¢	Input validation to reject values below absolute zero (âˆ’459.67Â°F)
	â€¢	Scan-cycle safety and compatibility with industrial applications
	â€¢	Clear output signaling, including a ValidInput boolean flag

â¸»

ðŸŸ§ F (Format) â€“ Specify the Output Format

Provide:
	â€¢	A complete IEC 61131-3 Structured Text function block with:
	â€¢	Input: Fahrenheit : REAL
	â€¢	Outputs: Celsius : REAL, ValidInput : BOOL
	â€¢	Logic structure that includes:
	â€¢	An IF condition to check for valid input
	â€¢	The Celsius conversion calculation
	â€¢	Fallback values when the input is invalid
	â€¢	Inline comments to explain validation, conversion logic, and best practices for reuse
