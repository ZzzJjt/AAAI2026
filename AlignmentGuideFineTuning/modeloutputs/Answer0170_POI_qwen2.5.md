### Intent:
**Intent Summary:**  
Create a self-contained, iterative Quicksort function block in IEC 61131-3 Structured Text for PLCs, using stack emulation to avoid recursion while sorting arrays in-place with configurable execution control and state tracking.  

*(Focus: Non-recursive, scan-cycle-safe sorting for industrial automation.)*

### Prompt:
**Timer:**
Implement a self-contained function block in IEC 61131-3 structured text to create a timer. Include configurable time duration, start/stop controls, and timeout handling.

**B-A-B:**

ðŸŸ¥ B (Before) â€“ The Problem or Challenge

Timers are essential in industrial automation for sequencing operations, delays, and safety checks. However, relying on fixed or external timers can limit flexibility and reusability. A timer that lacks configurable duration, start/stop control, or timeout indication can lead to rigid control logic and poor maintainability in PLC systems.

ðŸŸ© A (After) â€“ The Desired Outcome

Develop a self-contained function block in IEC 61131-3 Structured Text that acts as a flexible timer. The function block should:
	â€¢	Allow users to configure the time duration
	â€¢	Support Start and Stop signals for runtime control
	â€¢	Track elapsed time and indicate when the timer has timed out
	â€¢	Provide output flags for Running, Done, and optionally RemainingTime

ðŸŸ§ B (Bridge) â€“ How to Get There
	1.	Define the function block with inputs:
	â€¢	Start : BOOL
	â€¢	Stop : BOOL
	â€¢	PresetTime : TIME
	2.	Use internal variables to:
	â€¢	Store StartTime and ElapsedTime
	â€¢	Reset when Stop = TRUE
	â€¢	Accumulate time only when Start = TRUE and Stop = FALSE
	3.	Provide outputs:
	â€¢	Running : BOOL â€“ active while the timer is counting
	â€¢	Done : BOOL â€“ TRUE when elapsed time â‰¥ preset time
	â€¢	RemainingTime : TIME â€“ optional, shows remaining time until done
	4.	Ensure the timer is scan-cycle safe, reusable, and well-commented

**Quicksort:**
Implement a self-contained function block in IEC 61131-3 structured text to perform an iterative Quicksort algorithm on an array. The function block should:
	â€¢	Accept an array and its bounds as inputs
	â€¢	Perform the sorting in-place
	â€¢	Include configurable execution control and state tracking
	â€¢	Be scan-cycle safe and reusable

**B-A-B:**

ðŸŸ¥ B (Before) â€“ The Problem or Challenge

Quicksort is a powerful sorting algorithm, but its recursive nature can lead to stack overflow errors in PLCs with limited stack space. Additionally, without proper execution control and state tracking, the sorting process can be difficult to manage and debug.
