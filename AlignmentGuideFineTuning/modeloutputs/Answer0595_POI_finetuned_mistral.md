**Intent summary for code generation:**  
*"Generate IEC 61131-3 PID control logic with setpoint tracking, tunable parameters, manual/auto mode switching, and output saturation handling."*

### Prompt:
**Learning IEC 61499:**

Provide a concise introduction to the IEC 61499 programming language, emphasizing key concepts for someone already familiar with IEC 61131-3. Include a comparison of their fundamental differences in terms of architecture, execution models, and flexibility for distributed control systems. Additionally, compile a list of five key references for further reading on IEC 61499, highlighting its relevance in modern industrial applications.

**R-I-S-E:**
