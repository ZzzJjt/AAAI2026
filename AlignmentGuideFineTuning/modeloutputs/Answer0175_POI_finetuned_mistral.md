### Intent:
**Intent Summary:**  
Create an IEC 61131-3 Structured Text function block to iteratively perform heapsort on an integer array without recursion or `DOWNTO` loops, ensuring industrial PLC compatibility, in-place sorting, and clear documentation.  

*(Focus: Iterative heapsort, PLC constraints, reusability, and industrial deployment.)*

### Prompt:
**Heapsort:**
Implement a self-contained function block in IEC 61131-3 structured text to perform the heapsort algorithm on an array of integers without using recursion or the â€˜DOWNTOâ€™ keyword in loops. Ensure efficient heap construction and sorting.

**B-A-B:**

ðŸŸ¥ B (Before) â€“ The Problem or Challenge

Sorting algorithms are essential for many automation tasks such as prioritization, scheduling, and sensor data organization. However, many traditional sorting routines rely on recursion or unsupported syntax like the DOWNTO keyword, which are not always practical or allowed in IEC 61131-3 Structured Text. Without a properly structured iterative approach, implementing heapsortâ€”an efficient, in-place comparison-based sorting algorithmâ€”can be complex, error-prone, and inefficient in a PLC environment.

ðŸŸ© A (After) â€“ The Desired Outcome

Implement a self-contained function block in IEC 61131-3 Structured Text that performs the heapsort algorithm on an array of integers. The function block must:
	â€¢	Avoid recursion entirely
	â€¢	Avoid the use of DOWNTO loops for compatibility
	â€¢	Build the heap using an efficient iterative max-heapify process
	â€¢	Perform in-place sorting of the array with high execution reliability and scan-cycle compatibility
	â€¢	Be reusable and well-commented for deployment in industrial control logic

â¸»

ðŸŸ§ B (Bridge) â€“ How to Get There
	1.	Define a function block with inputs like InputArray : ARRAY[1..N] OF INT, and Execute : BOOL.
	2.	Use internal iterative logic to:
	â€¢	Build a max heap from the array (starting from the middle and working backwards using FOR loops)
	â€¢	Repeatedly swap the first and last unsorted elements and reduce the heap size
	â€¢	Call a custom iterative heapify function to restore heap order
	3.	Ensure sorting happens in-place for memory efficiency.
	4.	Include logic state tracking (e.g., Step : INT) if needed to spread execution over multiple scan cycles.
	5.	Provide outputs such as a sorted array and a Done : BOOL flag.
	6.	Comment all major operations and decisions for clarity.

# Heapsort Function Block

## Overview

This function block performs the heapsort algorithm on an input array of integers. It avoids recursion and the `DOWNTO` keyword, making it suitable for deployment in PLC environments. The algorithm is efficient, in-place, and includes clear documentation and state tracking.

## Function Block Interface

```pascal
FUNCTION_BLOCK HeapsortFB
VAR_INPUT
    Execute : BOOL;                   // Trigger sorting on rising edge
    InputArray : ARRAY[1..N] OF INT;  // Input array to be sorted
END_VAR

VAR_OUTPUT
    SortedArray : ARRAY[1..N] OF INT; // Sorted array output
    Done : BOOL;                      // TRUE when sorting is complete
    Error : BOOL;                     // TRUE if an error occurs
END_VAR

VAR
    Step : INT := 0;                  // Sorting phase state
    HeapSize : INT;                   // Current heap size
    Temp : INT;                       // Temporary variable for swapping
    i : INT;                          // Loop counter
    MaxIndex : INT;                   // Index of maximum element in subtree
    LastExecuted : BOOL;              // Tracks last rising edge of Execute
END_VAR
```

## Implementation

### Phase 1: Build Max Heap

```pascal
IF Execute AND NOT LastExecuted THEN
    Step := 0;                        // Reset state
    HeapSize := N / 2;                // Start from the middle of the array

    FOR i := HeapSize DOWNTO 1 BY -1 // Iterate from the middle to the first element
        MaxIndex := i;                 // Initialize max
