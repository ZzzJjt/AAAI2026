**Python Code**

```python
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from mpl_toolkits.mplot3d import Axes3D
from sklearn.neural_network import MLPRegressor
from sklearn.metrics import mean_squared_error

# Load historical data
data = np.load('historical_data.npy')

# Define the ANN model
model = MLPRegressor(hidden_layer_sizes=(100, 50, 25), max_iter=1000, alpha=1e-4, solver='sgd', random_state=1)

# Train the ANN
model.fit(data[:, :-1], data[:, -1])

# Predict temperature using the trained ANN
predicted_temperatures = model.predict(data[:, :-1])

# Compute the mean squared error between the predicted and actual temperatures
mse = mean_squared_error(data[:, -1], predicted_temperatures)

# Plot the temperature data and the predicted temperature using the ANN
fig = plt.figure()
ax = fig.add_subplot(111, projection='3d')
ax.scatter(data[:, 0], data[:, 1], data[:, 2], c=data[:, 3])
ax.scatter(data[:, 0], data[:, 1], data[:, 2], c=predicted_temperatures)
ax.set_xlabel('Time')
