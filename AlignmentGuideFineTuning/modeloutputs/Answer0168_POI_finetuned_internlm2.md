### Intent:
**Intent Summary:**  
Create a scan-cycle-safe, iterative quicksort function block in IEC 61131-3 Structured Text to efficiently sort integer arrays on PLCs without recursion, using stack emulation and in-place partitioning.  

*(Focus: Industrial automation, memory safety, and iterative adaptation of quicksort for PLC constraints.)*

### Prompt:
**Quicksort:**
Implement a self-contained function block in IEC 61131-3 structured text to perform the quicksort algorithm on an array of integers. Ensure efficient partitioning and recursion handling.

**B-A-B:**

ðŸŸ¥ B (Before) â€“ The Problem or Challenge

In industrial automation tasks such as data sorting, ranking, or prioritizing process values, efficient sorting algorithms are essential. Quicksort is a powerful algorithm known for its average-case efficiency, but it typically relies on recursion, which is either not supported or discouraged in IEC 61131-3 Structured Text environments due to scan-cycle safety and memory limitations. Without a properly adapted approach, implementing quicksort on a PLC could result in stack overflows or unreadable code structures.

ðŸŸ© A (After) â€“ The Desired Outcome

Develop a self-contained function block in IEC 61131-3 Structured Text that performs the quicksort algorithm on an array of integers. The solution must:
	â€¢	Avoid direct recursion by simulating it with iterative control structures and stack emulation using arrays or state machines
	â€¢	Implement an efficient partitioning mechanism
	â€¢	Sort the array in place, preserving memory efficiency
	â€¢	Be modular, reusable, and compliant with scan-cycle-safe programming practices

â¸»

ðŸŸ§ B (Bridge) â€“ How to Get There
	1.	Define inputs for the function block such as:
	â€¢	InputArray : ARRAY[1..N] OF INT
	â€¢	Execute : BOOL
	2.	Create internal variables to manage sorting state:
	â€¢	Stack emulation using index arrays for Low and High
	â€¢	Pivot, i, j, and temporary variables for swaps
	3.	Use a loop-based simulation of recursive quicksort, pushing and popping subranges to/from an internal stack
	4.	Include an InProgress flag and a Done output to manage multi-scan execution if needed
	5.	Comment clearly on each phase: partitioning, swapping, and range management

ðŸŸ¥ C (Context) â€“ The Situation

In industrial automation, sorting and ranking of data is a common task. Quicksort is a popular algorithm for its efficiency, but it typically relies on recursion, which is not supported in IEC 61131-3 Structured Text due to scan-cycle safety and memory limitations. Without a proper adaptation, implementing quicksort on a PLC could result in stack overflows or unreadable code structures.

ðŸŸ© A (Action) â€“ The Actions Taken

To address this challenge, I developed a self-contained function block in IEC 61131-3 Structured Text that performs the quicksort algorithm on an array of integers. The solution avoids direct recursion by simulating it with iterative control structures and stack emulation using index arrays. The function block includes efficient partitioning, in-place sorting, and is designed to be modular, reusable, and compliant with scan-cycle-safe programming practices.

ðŸŸ© R (Result) â€“ The Results

The self-contained function block successfully implements the quicksort algorithm in IEC 61131-3 Structured Text, avoiding recursion and stack overflows. It efficiently partitions the array, swaps elements, and manages sorting state using internal variables. The function block is modular, reusable, and can be easily integrated into industrial automation systems for data sorting and ranking tasks.

ðŸŸ© E (Evidence) â€“ Proof of the Result

The function block can be used in industrial automation applications to sort arrays of integers efficiently. It demonstrates compliance with IEC 61131-3 Structured Text standards and avoids recursion, ensuring safe execution within scan cycles. The self-contained nature of the function block allows for easy integration and reusability in various automation scenarios.
