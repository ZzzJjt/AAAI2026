### Intent:
**Intent Summary:**  
Create a reusable IEC 61131-3 function block in Structured Text to compare two REAL numbers with configurable decimal precision, handling rounding errors and invalid inputs, for reliable industrial control logic.  

*(Focus: Precision-aware floating-point comparison, error handling, modularity for automation systems.)*

### Prompt:
**Real Comparator:**
Implement a self-contained function block in IEC 61131-3 structured text to compare two real inputs up to n decimal places. Include configurable precision and error handling.

**C-A-R-E:**

ğŸŸ¥ C (Context) â€“ Background Situation

In industrial automation, comparing floating-point numbers (REAL values) directly can lead to unpredictable results due to rounding errors and precision limits inherent to binary floating-point representation. This is especially problematic in control logic, threshold detection, or alarm handling where precise decimal-level comparisons are required. A configurable comparator that accounts for decimal precision helps ensure stable and reliable logic decisions.

ğŸŸ© A (Action) â€“ Task to Perform

Develop a self-contained function block in IEC 61131-3 Structured Text to compare two REAL inputs with a configurable number of decimal places. The function block should:
	â€¢	Take Input1, Input2 : REAL and Precision : INT as inputs
	â€¢	Round both inputs to the specified precision using a scaling method
	â€¢	Compare the results and set output flags:
	â€¢	Equal : BOOL
	â€¢	Greater : BOOL
	â€¢	Less : BOOL
	â€¢	Include input validation and an Error : BOOL output in case of invalid precision values
	â€¢	Be written for scan-cycle safety and modular reuse

ğŸŸ¨ R (Result) â€“ Expected Outcome

The result is a modular, reusable comparator block that accurately determines equality or relational order between two REAL values up to n decimal places, ensuring:
	â€¢	Robust performance under rounding constraints
	â€¢	Clarity in control flow logic
	â€¢	Safe handling of erroneous or extreme inputs
	â€¢	Easy integration into PID tuning, setpoint checks, or quality monitoring systems

ğŸŸ¦ E (Example) â€“ Concrete Illustration

Example logic (simplified):

Scale := POWER(10, Precision);
Rounded1 := REAL_TO_INT(Input1 * Scale);
Rounded2 := REAL_TO_INT(Input2 * Scale);

Equal := (Rounded1 = Rounded2);
Greater := (Rounded1 > Rounded2);
Less := (Rounded1 < Rounded2);
Error := (Precision < 0);

Inputs:
	â€¢	Input1, Input2 : REAL
	â€¢	Precision : INT
	â€¢	Enable : BOOL

Outputs:
	â€¢	Equal, Greater, Less, Error : BOOL

ğŸŸ© R (Recommendation) â€“ Suggested Next Steps

1.	Develop the function block in IEC 61131-3 Structured Text, following the provided guidelines.
2.	Test the function block with various input combinations to ensure correct behavior and performance.
3.	Document the function block, including its purpose, inputs, outputs, and any limitations or assumptions.
4.	Provide a sample use case or application where the function block can be integrated to demonstrate its benefits.
5.	Consider sharing the function block with the community for potential reuse and improvement.

**Additional Notes:**

-	To ensure safety and reliability, the function block should be designed to handle invalid or extreme inputs gracefully, such as negative precision values or inputs outside the representable range.
-	To improve performance, consider using a more efficient scaling method, like integer multiplication and division, instead of the POWER function.
-	To enhance modularity, consider adding additional inputs or outputs to support more complex comparisons or control logic, such as tolerance bands or hysteresis.
-	To facilitate integration, consider providing a well-documented example or template for connecting the function block to other control elements or systems.
