### Prompt:
**Model Predictive Control for Optimizing Robot Movement Using Python:**

Develop Python code to implement a model predictive control (MPC) algorithm for optimizing the movement of a robot. The control system should consider dynamic constraints, path planning, and obstacle avoidance while ensuring smooth, efficient, and adaptive movement in a dynamic environment.

**C-A-R-E:**

ðŸŸ¥ Cï¼ˆContextï¼‰

Robots operating in dynamic environments often face challenges such as moving obstacles, tight path constraints, and the need for smooth and efficient motion. Traditional control methods may not adapt quickly enough to ensure safe and optimal navigation, especially when real-time decisions are required.

ðŸŸ© Aï¼ˆActionï¼‰

Develop Python code to implement a model predictive control (MPC) algorithm for robot motion optimization. The controller should handle path planning, obstacle avoidance, and dynamic constraints, while continuously predicting and adjusting the robotâ€™s movement to maintain smooth and efficient operation.

ðŸŸ¨ Rï¼ˆResultï¼‰

The resulting MPC-controlled robot should demonstrate adaptive, real-time trajectory optimization, maintaining smooth motion and effectively avoiding collisions. Compared to static or reactive control methods, the MPC approach should provide more intelligent and reliable navigation in complex environments.

ðŸŸ¦ Eï¼ˆExampleï¼‰

For example, simulate a robot navigating through a corridor with moving obstacles. Show how the MPC predicts future positions, reroutes accordingly, and maintains a smooth trajectoryâ€”avoiding jerky movements and ensuring timely arrival at the goal.

**Baseline Potential Field Controller:**

Compare the performance of the MPC-based robot navigation with a baseline potential field controller. Evaluate the position accuracy and energy efficiency of both systems, demonstrating the advantages of the MPC approach in dynamic environments.

**Metrics:**

1. **Position Accuracy (MSE):** Measure the Mean Squared Error (MSE) between the predicted and actual robot positions. Lower MSE values indicate better prediction accuracy and smoother movement.

2. **Energy Efficiency:** Evaluate the energy consumption of both systems during operation. Lower energy consumption indicates more efficient navigation.

**Python Code:**

```python
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Define the state space and control inputs
state_dim = 2  # 2-dimensional state space (x, y)
control_dim = 1  # 1-dimensional control input (linear velocity)

# Define the cost function
def cost_function(state, control, obstacle_map):
    # Calculate the distance between the robot and obstacles
    obstacle_distance = np.sqrt((state[0] - obstacle_map[:, :, 0]) ** 2 + (state[1] - obstacle_map[:, :, 1]) ** 2)
    # Calculate the cost based on the distance to obstacles
    cost = np.sum(obstacle_distance)
    return cost

# Define the MPC algorithm
def mpc_algorithm(state_dim, control_dim, horizon, obstacle_map):
    # Initialize the state and control variables
    state = np.zeros((horizon, state_dim))
    control = np.zeros((horizon, control_dim))

    # Run the MPC algorithm
    for t in range(horizon):
        # Predict the next state based on the current state and control input
        state_next = np.zeros((state_dim))
        control_next = np.zeros((control_dim))
        # Implement the dynamic constraints and path planning
        # ...
        # Update the state and control variables
        state[t] = state_next
        control[t] = control_next

    # Return the final state and control variables
    return state[-1], control[-1]

# Run the MPC algorithm and evaluate the performance
horizon = 10  # Number of time
