import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from sklearn.neural_network import MLPRegressor

# Step 1: Generate Synthetic Data
np.random.seed(42)
N = 1000
X = np.random.rand(N, 2)  # Input features (temperature, pressure)
y = np.sin(X[:, 0] + X[:, 1]) + 0.5 * np.random.rand(N)  # Output (flow rate)

# Step 2: Split Data
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.3, random_state=42)

# Step 3: Train ANN Model
ann = MLPRegressor(hidden_layer_sizes=(10, 5), max_iter=1000, activation='relu', solver='lbfgs', alpha=0.001)
ann.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Step 4: Evaluate ANN Model
y_pred = ann.predict(X_test)
print("R^2:", ann.score(X_test, y_test))
print("RMSE:", np.sqrt(np.mean((y_test - y_pred) ** 2)))

# Step 5: Plot Results
plt.scatter(y_test, y_pred)
plt.xlabel("True Flow Rate")
plt.ylabel("Predicted Flow Rate")
plt.title("ANN Flow Prediction")

# Step 6: Compare to PID Model
# Implement PID controller and compare performance

# Summary

This example demonstrates how to use Python and the scikit-learn MLPRegressor to build an artificial neural network (ANN) model for predicting flow rate based on temperature and pressure inputs. The ANN is trained on synthetic data and evaluated using R^2 and RMSE metrics. The code also includes a plot of the predicted versus true values for visual comparison. While not optimized
