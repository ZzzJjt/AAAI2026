### Intent:
**Intent Summary:**  
Develop an IEC 61131-3 Structured Text program to safely and sequentially shut down a steel production facility, including controlled furnace temperature reduction, fuel gas flow ramp-down over 12 hours, and dynamic oxygen supply adjustment to maintain a 1:2.5 fuel-to-air ratio, with embedded safety checks and modular functions.

### Prompt:
**Shutdown Steel Production:**

Develop a comprehensive list of steps for the controlled shutdown of a steel production facility. Include key stages such as reducing furnace temperature, controlling gas flow rates, and maintaining safe oxygen levels throughout the shutdown process.

Provide a detailed control narrative for steps 4 to 6 of the shutdown sequence, specifying concrete ranges and setpoints for variables such as temperature, gas flow, and oxygen levels.

Write a self-contained IEC 61131-3 Structured Text program based on this control narrative, ensuring proper sequencing and safety protocols.

Additionally, create a function in IEC 61131-3 to gradually reduce the fuel gas flow rate to the furnace burners over a period of 12 hours. This function should incorporate timing and safety checks to ensure smooth transitions.

Lastly, write an IEC 61131-3 function for adjusting the oxygen supply to the burners to maintain a precise fuel-to-air ratio of 1:2.5 during the shutdown. Ensure the function is adaptable to fluctuations in gas flow and temperature, and include safeguards for maintaining combustion efficiency.

ðŸŸ© A (Action)
	1.	Create a comprehensive shutdown procedure covering stages such as:
	â€¢	Furnace temperature reduction
	â€¢	Controlled fuel gas flow ramp-down
	â€¢	Oxygen level regulation to maintain combustion stability
	2.	Write a detailed control narrative for steps 4 to 6 of the shutdown sequence, specifying real values for:
	â€¢	Temperature setpoints (e.g., cool to < 400Â°C)
	â€¢	Gas flow reduction timeline (e.g., 12 hours)
	â€¢	Fuel-to-air ratio (1:2.5 for oxygen management)
	3.	Implement a Structured Text control program with proper sequencing, interlocks, and safety logic.
	4.	Develop two key IEC 61131-3 functions:
	â€¢	One to gradually reduce fuel gas flow using a linear ramp over 12 hours, with timing and fault checks.
	â€¢	One to adjust oxygen supply dynamically based on gas flow and temperature to ensure the 1:2.5 fuel-to-air ratio, with safeguards for combustion efficiency.
