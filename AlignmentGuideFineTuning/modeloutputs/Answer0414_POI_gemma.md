"Develop a fuzzy logic control system in MATLAB to regulate a chemical reactor's temperature, pressure, and reaction rate, with comparison against PID control under simulated disturbances."

### Prompt:
**Model Predictive Control for Aircraft Trajectory Using MATLAB:**

Develop MATLAB code to implement a model predictive control (MPC) algorithm for optimizing the trajectory of an aircraft. Ensure that the control scheme accounts for dynamic constraints, fuel efficiency, and external disturbances, while maintaining flight safety and performance objectives.

**R-I-S-E:**

ðŸŸ¥ Rï¼ˆRoleï¼‰

Act as an aerospace control systems engineer specializing in trajectory optimization and predictive control using MATLAB.

ðŸŸ© Iï¼ˆInputï¼‰

You are tasked with developing a control system for aircraft trajectory optimization. The system must account for dynamic constraints, fuel efficiency, external disturbances (e.g., wind), and ensure compliance with safety and performance requirements. MATLAB will be used for both modeling and implementation.

ðŸŸ§ Sï¼ˆStepsï¼‰
	1.	Model the aircraftâ€™s dynamics in MATLAB, incorporating variables such as position, velocity, control inputs, and external forces.
	2.	Formulate a model predictive control (MPC) scheme that includes constraints on system behavior and objectives related to fuel efficiency and flight safety.
	3.	Implement the MPC algorithm and simulate various flight scenarios with disturbances.
	4.	Evaluate the systemâ€™s ability to maintain optimal trajectory under different operational conditions.

ðŸŸ¦ Eï¼ˆExpectationï¼‰

The resulting MATLAB system should demonstrate that the MPC algorithm can optimize aircraft trajectory while respecting constraints and reacting adaptively to disturbancesâ€”enhancing fuel efficiency and maintaining flight safety.

% Model Predictive Control for Aircraft Trajectory Optimization
%
% This code implements a model predictive control (MPC) algorithm for
% optimizing the trajectory of an aircraft. The system accounts for dynamic
% constraints, fuel efficiency, and external disturbances, while maintaining
% flight safety and performance objectives.
%
% The code is written in MATLAB and includes the following functions:
%
% - model_aircraft: models the aircraft's dynamics, including position,
%   velocity, control inputs, and external forces.
% - formulate_mpc: formulates the MPC scheme, including constraints on
%   system behavior and objectives related to fuel efficiency and flight
%   safety.
% - simulate_mpc: simulates the MPC algorithm and evaluates the system's
%   ability to maintain optimal trajectory under different operational
%   conditions.
%
% The code can be used as a starting point for further development and
% optimization of aircraft trajectory control systems.
