### Intent:
**Intent Summary:**  
Create a scan-safe, iterative quicksort function block in IEC 61131-3 Structured Text that sorts integer arrays in place using stack-managed partitioning, with robust status flags (Execute/Busy/Done) for PLC integration.  

*(Key aspects: non-recursive, industrial reliability, Lomuto/Hoare partitioning, and scan-cycle safety.)*

### Prompt:
**Quicksort:**
Implement a self-contained function block in IEC 61131-3 structured text to perform the quicksort algorithm on an array of integers. Ensure efficient partitioning and recursion handling.

**R-T-F:**

ðŸŸ¥ R (Role) â€“ Define Your Role

Act as a PLC programmer creating a robust, scan-safe quicksort function block in IEC 61131-3 Structured Text for industrial control systems.

â¸»

ðŸŸ© T (Task) â€“ Define the Objective

Design and implement a self-contained function block that performs the quicksort algorithm on an array of integers. Your implementation must:
	â€¢	Sort the array in place
	â€¢	Replace recursive calls with iterative logic using a manually managed stack
	â€¢	Use an efficient partitioning method (such as Lomuto or Hoare)
	â€¢	Be modular, reusable, and compatible with PLC scan cycles
	â€¢	Include clear status handling with Execute, Busy, and Done flags
	â€¢	Prevent runtime issues such as stack overflows or memory errors

â¸»

ðŸŸ§ F (Format) â€“ Specify the Output Format

Provide a complete IEC 61131-3 Structured Text function block with:
	â€¢	Inputs:
	â€¢	InputArray : ARRAY[1..N] OF INT
	â€¢	Execute : BOOL
	â€¢	Outputs:
	â€¢	SortedArray : ARRAY[1..N] OF INT (optional)
	â€¢	Done : BOOL
	â€¢	Busy : BOOL
	â€¢	Internal components:
	â€¢	Stack simulation using LowStack, HighStack arrays
	â€¢	Variables for Pivot, i, j, and temporary swap buffer
	â€¢	Iterative loop to simulate quicksort recursion
	â€¢	Inline comments explaining:
	â€¢	Stack operations
	â€¢	Subarray bounds management
	â€¢	Partitioning logic
