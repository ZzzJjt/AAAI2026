### Prompt:
**Model Predictive Control for HVAC System Optimization Using C++:**

Develop C++ code to implement a model predictive control (MPC) algorithm for optimizing the performance of a Heating, Ventilation, and Air Conditioning (HVAC) system. The control system should manage temperature, humidity, and energy consumption while maintaining occupant comfort. It must consider dynamic constraints such as varying external temperatures, occupancy levels, and energy efficiency requirements, ensuring optimal control under changing environmental conditions.
