### Intent:
The task is to create a structured NORSOK-compliant System Control Diagram (SCD) in textual notation for an LNG vaporizer system, detailing piping flows, instrumentation tags, control loops, and safety interlocks with standardized formatting.  

**Intent Summary:**  
*Generate a text-based SCD for LNG vaporization with tagged instrumentation, control loops, and interlocks in NORSOK format.*

### Prompt:
**SCD LNG Vaporizer:**

Create a NORSOK system control diagram (SCD) in textual notation for a LNG Vaporizer System. Include instrumentation, control loops, and interlocks. Provide concrete tag numbers and piping.

**R-T-F:**

ðŸŸ¥ R (Role) â€“ Define Your Role

Act as a process control engineer responsible for documenting a NORSOK-compliant System Control Diagram (SCD) for an LNG vaporizer system using structured textual notation.

â¸»

ðŸŸ© T (Task) â€“ Define the Objective

Create a text-based SCD for the LNG vaporizer that includes:
	â€¢	The full piping and process flow from LNG inlet to gas outlet
	â€¢	All relevant instrumentation with standard tag numbers (e.g., FT201, TT101, FIC202, FCV203)
	â€¢	Key control loops for temperature, flow, and pressure regulation
	â€¢	Associated interlocks for safety shutdowns (e.g., high-pressure trips, ESD logic)
	â€¢	Clearly structured layout using directional arrows (-->) and indentation for clarity

â¸»

ðŸŸ§ F (Format) â€“ Specify the Output Format

Present the output in plain-text format, organized as follows:
	â€¢	One line per major flow segment (e.g., LNG Inlet --> FT201 --> FIC201 --> FCV201 --> Vaporizer)
	â€¢	Grouped sections for each control loop (e.g., [Temperature Control Loop])
	â€¢	Each control loop should show the measurement device, controller, and final control element
	â€¢	Clearly label interlocks under a [Safety Interlocks] section with signal conditions and shutdown targets
	â€¢	Use consistent tag naming and logical flow formatting throughout
