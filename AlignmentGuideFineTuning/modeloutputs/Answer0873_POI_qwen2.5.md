ðŸŸ¥ T (Task) â€“ What You Need to Do

Create a self-contained function block in IEC 61131-3 Structured Text that performs linear interpolation between two known data points.

â¸»

ðŸŸ© A (Action) â€“ How to Do It
	1.	Define a function block named LinearInterpolation with the following REAL inputs:
	â€¢	X1, Y1: First known point
	â€¢	X2, Y2: Second known point
	â€¢	X: The value at which interpolation should occur
	2.	Compute the interpolated output Y using the formula:
Y := Y1 + \frac{(X - X1) \times (Y2 - Y1)}{(X2 - X1)}
Add a conditional check to avoid division by zero:
IF X2 <> X1 THEN
    Y := Y1 + ((X - X1) * (Y2 - Y1)) / (X2 - X1);
ELSE
    Y := Y1; // Or use fallback logic
END_IF;
3.	Include inline comments that explain each part of the calculation.
	4.	Address floating-point rounding and real-time scan cycle constraints, ensuring the block runs efficiently in control applications.

ðŸŸ¦ G (Goal) â€“ What You Want to Achieve

Provide a reusable, lightweight, and accurate function block for linear interpolation that supports applications like:
	â€¢	Sensor signal scaling
	â€¢	Analog-to-digital conversion mapping
	â€¢	Dynamic setpoint adjustments

The function block must ensure safe, predictable results and be suitable for deployment in real-time PLC environments.

```structuredtext
FUNCTION_BLOCK LinearInterpolation
    VAR_INPUT
        X1 : REAL; // First known point X-coordinate
        Y1 : REAL; // First known point Y-coordinate
        X2 : REAL; // Second known point X-coordinate
        Y2 : REAL; // Second known point Y-coordinate
        X : REAL;  // Value at which interpolation should occur
    END_VAR

    VAR_OUTPUT
        Y : REAL;  // Interpolated output Y-coordinate
    END_VAR

    VAR
        slope : REAL; // Slope of the line
        Y_interpolated : REAL; // Interpolated Y value
    END_VAR

    // Check for division by zero
    IF X2 <> X1 THEN
        slope := (Y2 - Y1) / (X2 - X1);
        Y_interpolated := Y1 + slope * (X - X1);
    ELSE
        // Handle vertical line case or use fallback logic
        Y_interpolated := Y1;
    END_IF;

    Y := Y_interpolated;
END_FUNCTION_BLOCK
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Inputs:**
   - `X1`, `Y1`: Coordinates of the first known point.
   - `X2`, `Y2`: Coordinates of the second known point.
   - `X`: The value at which interpolation should occur.

2. **Output:**
   - `Y`: The interpolated output Y-coordinate.

3. **Variables:**
   - `slope`: The slope of the line connecting the two points.
   - `Y_interpolated`: The interpolated Y value.

4. **Calculation:**
   - The function calculates the slope of the line using the formula:
     \[
     \text{slope} = \frac{Y2 - Y1}{X2 - X1}
     \]
   - It then computes the interpolated Y value using the formula:
     \[
     Y_{\text{interpolated}} = Y1 + \text{slope} \times (X - X1)
     \]
   - A conditional check ensures that division by zero is handled gracefully.

5. **Comments:**
   - Inline comments explain each step of the calculation, making the code self-documenting.

6. **Precision and Real-Time Considerations:**
   - The function is designed
