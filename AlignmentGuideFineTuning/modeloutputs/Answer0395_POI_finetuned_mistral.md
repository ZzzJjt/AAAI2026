### Intent:
**Intent Summary:**  
Create a 30-row I/O list table for a steel rolling mill, specifying signal names, I/O types, tagnumbers, analog/digital status, units, ranges, setpoints, and P&ID references to standardize control system integration.

### Prompt:
**IO List Rolling Mill:**

Create an I/O list as a table with 30 lines for a rolling mill in a steel production plant. Have as columns signal name, input/output, signal tagnumber, analog/digital, engineering unit, ranges, setpoint, and P&ID reference.

**C-A-R-E:**

üü• C (Context) ‚Äì Background Situation

In the design and automation of a rolling mill within a steel production plant, a clearly defined I/O list is essential for engineering coordination across instrumentation, control logic, wiring diagrams, and HMIs. This list ensures that all signals are accurately identified and mapped with associated parameters such as range, unit, and control setpoints‚Äîcritical for system integration and commissioning.

‚∏ª

üü© A (Action) ‚Äì Task to Perform

Create a structured I/O list table with 30 signals for a rolling mill. Each row should represent one signal and include the following columns:
	‚Ä¢	Signal Name
	‚Ä¢	Input/Output
	‚Ä¢	Signal Tagnumber
	‚Ä¢	Analog/Digital
	‚Ä¢	Engineering Unit
	‚Ä¢	Range
	‚Ä¢	Setpoint
	‚Ä¢	P&ID Reference

Ensure that signals represent realistic rolling mill components, such as roll gap sensors, motor drives, cooling valves, and tension feedback. Use consistent units (e.g., ¬∞C, bar, kN, m/min) and appropriate setpoints and ranges.

‚∏ª

üü® R (Result) ‚Äì Expected Outcome

The result should be a complete, clearly formatted I/O list that serves as a master reference for system design, PLC programming, field wiring, and control documentation. It should improve communication between mechanical, electrical, and automation teams, and reduce integration errors during commissioning.
