### Intent:
**Intent Summary:**  
Develop a C++-based Model Predictive Control (MPC) system for wind farm optimization that dynamically adjusts turbine operations and energy storage to maximize power output efficiency and grid stability under variable wind conditions.

### Prompt:
**Model Predictive Control for Wind Farm Optimization Using C++:**

Develop C++ code to implement a model predictive control (MPC) algorithm to optimize the operation of a wind farm. The control system should consider factors such as wind speed variability, turbine dynamics, and power output efficiency. It should also ensure grid stability while accounting for constraints on turbine operation, energy storage, and power dispatch under fluctuating environmental conditions.

The MPC system should demonstrate improved power generation efficiency, more stable grid output, and enhanced adaptability to environmental disturbances compared to traditional control systemsâ€”ensuring robust and intelligent operation of the wind farm. The C++ code should be modular, well-documented, and scalable to accommodate future enhancements and expansions.

**C++ Code Example:**

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>

// Define wind turbine model
class WindTurbine {
public:
    void update(double windSpeed) {
        // Update turbine state based on wind speed
    }
};

// Define energy storage model
class EnergyStorage {
public:
    void charge(double power) {
        // Charge energy storage with given power
    }
    void discharge(double power) {
        // Discharge energy storage with given power
    }
};

// Define MPC controller
class MPCController {
public:
    void control(std::vector<WindTurbine>& turbines, EnergyStorage& storage) {
        // Implement MPC algorithm to optimize turbine output and power dispatch
    }
};

int main() {
    // Initialize wind turbines and energy storage
    std::vector<WindTurbine> turbines;
    EnergyStorage storage;

    // Create MPC controller
    MPCController controller;

    // Run simulation
    while (true) {
        // Update wind turbine states
        for (auto& turbine : turbines) {
            turbine.update(getWindSpeed());
        }

        // Control turbines and manage energy storage
        controller.control(turbines, storage);

        // Check constraints and adjust control if necessary
        if (!isWithinConstraints()) {
            // Adjust control to meet constraints
        }
    }

    return 0;
}
```

**Key Considerations:**

1. **Wind Turbine Modeling**: Develop a model that accurately captures the dynamics of wind turbines, including rotor speed, blade pitch, and generator output. Consider factors such as wind speed, turbulence, and yaw misalignment.
2. **Energy Storage Modeling**: Implement a model for energy storage systems, such as batteries or flywheels, that accounts for charging and discharging rates, capacity, and efficiency.
3. **MPC Algorithm**: Design a model predictive control algorithm that takes into account the wind turbine and energy storage models. The algorithm should optimize power output, minimize energy losses, and ensure grid stability.
4. **Constraint Management**: Implement logic to handle constraints on turbine operation, energy storage, and power dispatch. This may include limits on turbine speed, energy storage capacity, and grid frequency.
5. **Real-Time Simulation
