### Intent:
**Intent Summary:**  
Develop a Python-based non-linear model predictive controller (NMPC) to optimize steam generator startup in power plants by minimizing time and energy while adhering to safety constraints, using modular code with clear documentation of the model, optimization, and control strategy.  

*(Focus: NMPC implementation for non-linear thermal process control with efficiency and safety goals.)*

### Prompt:
**Startup Steam Generator:**

Develop a non-linear model-predictive controller (NMPC) in Python to optimize the startup process of a steam generator in a power plant. The NMPC should be designed to handle the non-linear dynamics of the steam generation process, considering key variables such as pressure, temperature, and flow rates. The controller must minimize startup time while maintaining safety and operational constraints.

Ensure that the Python implementation is modular, with clear explanations of the optimization algorithm, control horizon, and prediction model. Discuss the benefits of using NMPC for steam generator startup, particularly in terms of energy efficiency and system stability, and highlight the challenges associated with controlling such a complex non-linear process.

⸻

🟩 I (Input) – Information Provided

You are tasked with implementing an NMPC system that must:
	•	Handle the non-linear dynamics of steam generation (e.g., pressure rise, heat transfer, flow rate feedback)
	•	Respect operational and safety constraints (e.g., max temperature, min pressure)
	•	Use a modular Python structure for readability and reusability
	•	Include clear descriptions of:
	•	The prediction model
	•	The control and prediction horizons
	•	The optimization algorithm used
	•	Highlight the benefits of NMPC (like energy efficiency and startup speed) and discuss challenges in modeling non-linear thermal processes

⸻

🟧 S (Steps) – Implementation Steps
	1.	Model the steam generator using a system of non-linear differential equations (ODEs) or use surrogate models from data.
	2.	Define the control objective, such as minimizing time to reach nominal operating conditions (temperature, pressure).
	3.	Formulate constraints (e.g., P \geq 30\,bar, T \leq 520\,°C) and encode them into your NMPC optimization problem.
	4.	Choose an optimization library (e.g., CasADi, GEKKO, Pyomo) and build the NMPC loop with real-time constraints and state updates.
	5.	Structure your code into modular components:
	•	model.py (non-linear process model)
	•	controller.py (NMPC loop and solver)
	•	main.py (simulation runner)
	6.	Add inline documentation and discuss limitations such as model accuracy, computational load, and real-time feasibility.

🟦 E (Expectation) – Expected Outcome

Produce a Python-based NMPC controller that can:
	•	Optimize the startup process by minimizing time and energy usage
	•	Respect critical safety and operational limits
	•	Adapt in real-time to changes in process dynamics
	•	Provide a clean, modular, and documented codebase that is extensible to other thermal systems

This NMPC implementation should demonstrate how advanced control strategies outperform traditional methods in both efficiency and robustness.
