### Intent:
**Intent Summary:**  
Create an IEC 61131-3 Structured Text function block to reliably read five process values from an IO-Link master, with error handling and status reporting for each read operation.  

*(Focus: IO-Link communication, data integrity, and diagnostic transparency in industrial automation.)*

### Prompt:
**IO-Link Data Acquisition Using 61131-3 Structured Text:**

Develop a function block in structured text (ST) based on IEC 61131 standards to read five values from a remote IO-Link master. The function block should handle communication with the IO-Link master, retrieve the required process data, and provide the status of each read operation. Discuss the methodology used for error checking, status reporting, and handling of potential communication issues between the IO-Link master and the connected devices.

**R-I-S-E:**

ðŸŸ¥ R (Role) â€“ Your Role

Act as an industrial automation engineer developing IEC 61131-3 Structured Text (ST) function blocks for device-level communication using IO-Link.

ðŸŸ© I (Input) â€“ What Youâ€™re Given

You need to create a function block that communicates with a remote IO-Link master to read five process values. The block must manage communication with the master, handle potential read errors, and report the status of each read operation. Reliability, fault tolerance, and status transparency are essential.

ðŸŸ§ S (Steps) â€“ What to Do
	1.	Define input parameters to initiate reading and identify IO-Link channels or data objects.
	2.	Implement logic to communicate with the IO-Link master and sequentially or concurrently retrieve five process values.
	3.	For each read, verify the result and generate a corresponding status output (e.g., success, timeout, CRC error).
	4.	Add error-handling routines to retry failed reads or flag issues to the controller, ensuring traceability and real-time feedback.

ðŸŸ¦ E (Expectation) â€“ What Success Looks Like

The resulting function block should reliably read five values from an IO-Link master, return those values along with individual read statuses, and provide built-in error detection. This enables real-time diagnostics, enhances data integrity, and ensures robust IO-Link communication under varying network conditions.
