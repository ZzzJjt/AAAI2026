### Intent:
**Intent Summary:**  
Develop an ISA-88-compliant batch control program in IEC 61131-3 Structured Text to automate the adhesive production process, focusing on the Reaction step (B.2) with sequential operations (heating, mixing, holding) managed via modular logic, timers, and state transitions.

### Prompt:
**Batch Adhesive:**

Develop an ISA-88 batch control recipe for the production of adhesive, detailing the stages involved in the process. Create a self-contained program in IEC 61131-3 Structured Text to manage the sequential control of step B.2, Reaction, with specific process parameters and timers. Include the necessary control logic to call methods corresponding to each phase of the reaction, ensuring that transitions between steps are managed through appropriate conditions and timer values.

Incorporate detailed content for calling the methods that govern specific operations, such as heating, mixing, and maintaining the reaction environment. Additionally, discuss the integration of ISA-88 standards in batch process control, focusing on how the structured text program facilitates modularity and flexibility in controlling the adhesive production process.

ðŸŸ¥ R (Role) â€“ Define Your Role

Act as a control systems engineer implementing ISA-88-compliant batch processes using IEC 61131-3 Structured Text.

ðŸŸ© I (Input) â€“ Information Provided

You are developing a batch control system for adhesive production, specifically focusing on step B.2: Reaction. The process includes multiple operations such as heating, mixing, and holding, each with specific parameters and timing requirements. The system must follow ISA-88 standards for modularity and procedural abstraction. Your goal is to create a self-contained Structured Text program that controls this step and integrates smoothly into the full batch recipe.

ðŸŸ§ S (Steps) â€“ Implementation Steps
	1.	Design an ISA-88-compliant recipe structure that outlines the main stages of adhesive production, with clear focus on the Reaction step.
	2.	Develop Structured Text methods or function blocks to control operations like StartHeating, StartMixing, and HoldReaction, including input parameters (e.g., temperature, speed, time).
	3.	Implement sequential control logic that manages transitions between phases using timers and real-time conditions.
	4.	Ensure the code structure is modular, with reusable components and clear state handling, consistent with ISA-88 procedural models.

ðŸŸ¦ E (Expectation) â€“ Expected Outcome

Deliver a Structured Text program that performs step B.2 of the batch adhesive recipe reliably and in compliance with ISA-88. The program should facilitate easy integration with other batch stages, support reuse of control logic, and enhance clarity, safety, and flexibility in the adhesive manufacturing process.

**B-A-B-E:**

Before

You are a control systems engineer tasked with implementing a batch control recipe for adhesive production using IEC 61131-3 Structured Text. The process involves multiple steps, including heating, mixing, and holding, and must follow ISA-88 standards for modularity and procedural abstraction.

After

You have developed a self-contained Structured Text program that controls the Reaction step (B.2) of the adhesive production process. The program includes methods for heating, mixing, and holding, with appropriate parameter values and timers. It manages transitions between steps using structured logic and modular control functions.

Bridge

The key to implementing ISA-88-compliant batch control in Structured Text is to break down the process into clearly defined methods and use structured logic to manage transitions between steps. This approach ensures that the control program is modular, reusable, and compliant with ISA-88 standards.

Example

Implement a self-contained program in IEC 61131-3 Structured Text to control the Reaction step of an adhesive production batch. Include methods for heating, mixing, and holding, with appropriate parameter values and timers. Use structured logic to manage transitions between steps, ensuring compliance with ISA-88 standards.
