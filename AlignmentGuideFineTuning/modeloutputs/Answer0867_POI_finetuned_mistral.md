### Intent:
**Intent Summary:**  
Create a reusable IEC 61131-3 Structured Text function block to compute the mean and sample standard deviation of a 100-integer array, ensuring robustness against overflow and clear output for industrial control applications.  

*(Focus: Array statistics, real-time safety, deterministic execution)*

### Prompt:
**Natural Logarithm:**

Develop a self-contained function block in IEC 61131-3 Structured Text to compute the natural logarithm of a given input. Ensure that the implementation is efficient and well-documented, with comments explaining the mathematical foundation of the natural logarithm. Additionally, address potential edge cases, such as handling non-positive inputs, and discuss the precision and performance of this function block in typical industrial applications.

**T-A-G:**

🟥 T (Task) – What You Need to Do

Design a self-contained function block in IEC 61131-3 Structured Text that computes the natural logarithm of a given real input value. The block should be reusable, safe, and suitable for use in real-time industrial control systems.

⸻

🟩 A (Action) – How to Do It
	1.	Create a function block named NaturalLog with:
	•	Input:
	•	X : REAL — the number to compute ln(X)
	•	Outputs:
	•	LnX : REAL — the result of ln(X)
	•	Error : BOOL — set to TRUE if X ≤ 0, indicating an invalid input
	2.	Implement the logic:
	•	Use the built-in LN() function for valid inputs:

 IF X > 0.0 THEN
    LnX := LN(X);
    Error := FALSE;
ELSE
    LnX := 0.0;
    Error := TRUE;
END_IF;

	•	Add inline comments explaining:
	•	ln(X) is undefined for X ≤ 0
	•	Why Error is raised for domain violations
	•	How the function is kept simple and deterministic for PLC use

	3.	Ensure compatibility and efficiency:
	•	Avoid recursion or dynamic structures
	•	Ensure all code executes predictably within a scan cycle
	•	Optionally include versioning or diagnostic codes for system integration

⸻

🟦 G (Goal) – What You Want to Achieve

Deliver a robust and reusable logarithm function block that:
	•	Handles invalid input safely and predictably
	•	Can be used in real-time PLC applications like:
	•	Sensor signal scaling
	•	Flow computation with exponential behavior
	•	Energy modeling using logarithmic relationships
	•	Provides clear feedback and documentation for system diagnostics and maintenance
