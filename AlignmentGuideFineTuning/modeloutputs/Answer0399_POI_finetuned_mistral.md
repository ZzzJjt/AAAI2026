### Intent:
**Intent Summary:**  
Create a NORSOK-compliant textual System Control Diagram (SCD) for an LNG vaporizer system, detailing instrumentation (e.g., FT101, TIC201), control loops (PID logic for flow/pressure/temperature), safety interlocks (ESD triggers), and piping flow, formatted for clarity and traceability.  

**Code-Generation Intent:**  
Generate a structured textual representation of control logic, instrumentation tags, and interlock sequences for an LNG vaporizer system, adhering to NORSOK I-005 standards.  

*(Output format: Hierarchical text with arrows (-->), grouped sections, and explicit tag references for control loops, alarms, and shutdown logic.)*

### Prompt:
**SCD LNG Vaporizer:**

Create a NORSOK system control diagram (SCD) in textual notation for a LNG Vaporizer System. Include instrumentation, control loops, and interlocks. Provide concrete tag numbers and piping.


**C-A-R-E:**

ðŸŸ¥ C (Context) â€“ Background Situation

In LNG (Liquefied Natural Gas) processing, the vaporizer system plays a critical role in converting LNG into gas for downstream use. For projects governed by NORSOK standards, a System Control Diagram (SCD) is required to document control loops, instrumentation, and interlocks in a structured, traceable format. When graphical SCD tools are unavailableâ€”such as in early design phases or text-based engineering environmentsâ€”engineers must rely on textual notation to convey the same level of detail and logic clarity.

ðŸŸ© A (Action) â€“ Task to Perform

Create a NORSOK-compliant System Control Diagram (SCD) using textual notation for an LNG vaporizer system. The diagram should include:
	â€¢	Major equipment and piping flow (e.g., LNG inlet â†’ vaporizer â†’ gas outlet)
	â€¢	Key instrumentation and control loops, with standard tag names (e.g., TT101, FIC201, FCV202)
	â€¢	Defined interlocks and trip signals, such as high-pressure shutdowns or emergency stop triggers
	â€¢	Logical formatting using directional arrows (-->), indents, and grouped sections for clarity

â¸»

ðŸŸ¨ R (Result) â€“ Expected Outcome

The result will be a structured, readable, and logically complete textual SCD that can:
	â€¢	Support system design, safety analysis, and DCS/PLC implementation
	â€¢	Facilitate interdepartmental review of instrumentation and control logic
	â€¢	Comply with NORSOK I-005 standards for system documentation
	â€¢	Act as a draft for graphical SCD development later in the design phase
