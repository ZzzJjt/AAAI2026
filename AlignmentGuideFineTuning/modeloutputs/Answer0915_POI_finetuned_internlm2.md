### Intent:
The task is to develop a real-time PID control program in Structured Text for maintaining a chemical reactor's pressure at 5.0 bar by adjusting a control valve, with safety checks for emergency stops and sensor validity.

### Prompt:
**PID Flow Control Water Treatment:**

Develop a self-contained IEC 61131-3 Structured Text program to implement PID feedback control for chemical dosing in a water treatment process. The program should regulate the dosing rate of chlorine at 3 ppm, adjusting based on real-time flow measurements with a sampling rate of 100 ms.

The control logic should include PID parameters (proportional, integral, and derivative gains) that are tuned for maintaining the desired dosing concentration. Ensure the program accounts for any deviations from the setpoint and adjusts the chemical dosing accordingly, while including safety limits to prevent overdosing or underdosing. Discuss the importance of precise flow control in water treatment, with a focus on maintaining safe and effective chemical levels.

**T-A-G:**

ðŸŸ¥ T (Task) â€“ What You Need to Do

ðŸŸ© A (Action) â€“ How to Do It
	1.	Read process inputs:
	â€¢	Dosing_PV: Measured chlorine concentration (ppm)
	â€¢	FlowRate: Water flow rate (optional/future use)
	2.	Calculate error between the setpoint (Dosing_SP := 3.0 ppm) and the measured value.
	3.	Apply PID logic using predefined gains:
	â€¢	Proportional (Kp := 2.0)
	â€¢	Integral (Ki := 0.5)
	â€¢	Derivative (Kd := 0.1)
	4.	Update internal states: accumulate the integral and compute the derivative based on the error change.
	5.	Clamp the output (Dosing_Output) between Min_Dose := 0.0 and Max_Dose := 10.0 to ensure safe operation.
	6.	Output the result to control the dosing pump.
