### Intent:
**Intent Summary:**  
Develop an OPC UA client in C wrapped as an IEC 61131-3 ST function block with non-blocking server communication, timeout handling, and error reporting for PLC integration.  

*(Key focus: C-to-ST interface, OPC UA connectivity, and deterministic error management in industrial control.)*

### Prompt:
**OPC UA Client Implementation Using C and IEC 61131-3 Structured Text:**

Develop C-code for an OPC UA client, then wrap it into an IEC 61131-based function block written in structured text (ST). The function block should have the following input pins: Execute (type: BOOL), ServerUrl (type: STRING[255]), and Timeout (type: TIME). The output pins should include Done (type: BOOL), Busy (type: BOOL), Error (type: BOOL), and ErrorID (type: DWORD). In your explanation, describe how the C-code interfaces with the OPC UA server, how the function block manages communication with the server, and how error handling is implemented. Provide details on how to integrate this function block within an IEC 61131-3 environment for reliable client-server communication.

**R-I-S-E:**

ðŸŸ¥ R (Role) â€“ Your Role

Act as a systems integration engineer working with C and IEC 61131-3 Structured Text (ST) to embed OPC UA client functionality into a PLC environment.

ðŸŸ© I (Input) â€“ What Youâ€™re Given

You need to implement an OPC UA client in C and make it available in a PLC program through a function block written in Structured Text. The function block should expose the following interface:

Inputs:

	â€¢	Execute (BOOL): Starts the OPC UA connection process
	â€¢	ServerUrl (STRING[255]): The OPC UA server address
	â€¢	Timeout (TIME): Maximum duration to wait for a response

Outputs:

	â€¢	Done (BOOL): Set to TRUE when the operation completes successfully
	â€¢	Busy (BOOL): TRUE while the operation is ongoing
	â€¢	Error (BOOL): Set if the connection fails
	â€¢	ErrorID (DWORD): Contains an error code for diagnosis

Additionally, the implementation must include robust error handling, proper session management, and seamless integration between C and the ST environment.

ðŸŸ§ S (Steps) â€“ What You Need to Do

	1.	Write C-code for the OPC UA client using a suitable library (e.g., open62541) to manage server connection, session creation, and error handling.
	2.	Create a C interface (DLL or static library) that exposes functions callable from IEC 61131-3 ST environments.
	3.	Implement an ST function block that calls these C functions, controls the connection lifecycle using Execute and Timeout, and sets the appropriate output flags (Done, Busy, Error, ErrorID).
	4.	Ensure rising-edge detection on Execute, prevent blocking behavior, and handle timeouts and connection errors with meaningful codes.

ðŸŸ¦ E (Expectation) â€“ What Success Looks Like

The resulting solution enables the PLC to initiate OPC UA client sessions in a non-blocking, deterministic manner. It provides reliable communication with OPC UA servers, with clear status reporting and error trackingâ€”making it suitable for use in real-time industrial control environments.
