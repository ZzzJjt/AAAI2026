### Intent:
The task is to develop an ISA-88-compliant batch control program in IEC 61131-3 Structured Text for producing 100 kg of cocoa milk, including ingredient dosing, mixing at 200 RPM, heating to 70Â°C, and phase-based process control with fault handling.

### Prompt:
**Batch Cocoa Milk:**

Create an ISA-88 batch control recipe for producing 100 kg of cocoa milk, detailing the required ingredients, including milk, water, liquid sugar, and cocoa. The equipment should consist of a mixing and blending vessel capable of stirring and heating. Specify appropriate amounts for each ingredient, as well as optimal mixing temperatures and heating times.

Write a self-contained program in IEC 61131-3 Structured Text for the sequential control of the mixing process, incorporating typical parameter values such as stirring speed, temperature control, and time duration. Ensure the program follows ISA-88 principles, with clear logic for controlling the heating and blending phases. Discuss the challenges in scaling and optimizing the control process for industrial production.

**R-T-F:**

ðŸŸ¥ R (Role) â€“ Define Your Role

Act as a control systems engineer developing ISA-88-compliant batch processing programs using IEC 61131-3 Structured Text for food manufacturing systems.

ðŸŸ© T (Task) â€“ Define the Objective

Create an ISA-88-compliant batch control recipe to produce 100 kg of cocoa milk. The ingredients include milk, water, liquid sugar, and cocoa, processed in a mixing and blending vessel with heating and stirring capabilities. Then, implement a self-contained Structured Text program to control the sequential mixing and heating process, including:
	â€¢	Specific ingredient quantities
	â€¢	Stirring speed (e.g., 200 RPM)
	â€¢	Heating temperature (e.g., 70Â°C)
	â€¢	Time durations (e.g., 10 minutes blending)

The program must include logic for transitioning between ingredient addition, heating, and blending phases, and it should follow ISA-88 principles for modularity and phase separation.

ðŸŸ§ F (Format) â€“ Specify the Output Format

Provide a complete IEC 61131-3 Structured Text code block that includes:
	â€¢	Parameterized function or method calls for each operation (AddIngredient, StartHeating, StartMixing)
	â€¢	Use of timers, setpoints, and interlocks
	â€¢	Clear phase-based logic with comments and modular structure
	â€¢	Optional discussion on how the logic supports process scalability and reuse

**ISA-88 Batch Control Recipe:**

1. **Ingredients:**
	* 50 kg milk
	* 20 kg water
	* 10 kg liquid sugar
	* 10 kg cocoa
2. **Equipment:**
	* Mixing and blending vessel
	* Heating element
	* Stirring mechanism
3. **Process:**
	1. Add milk, water, liquid sugar, and cocoa to the mixing vessel.
	2. Start heating the mixture to 70Â°C.
	3. Once the mixture reaches 70Â°C, start stirring at 200 RPM.
	4. Mix the ingredients for 10 minutes.
	5. Turn off the heating element and stop stirring.
