### Intent:
**Intent Summary:**  
Create a structured text function block to convert a 10-digit decimal value to hexadecimal in IEC 61131-3, handling large values and edge cases for industrial automation applications.

### Prompt:
**DecToHex:**
Implement a self-contained function block in IEC 61131-3 structured text to convert a 10-digit decimal value to hexadecimal. Ensure proper handling of large values and edge cases.

**B-A-B:**

🟥 B (Before) – The Problem or Challenge

In industrial automation systems, there’s often a need to display or log numerical data in hexadecimal format, especially for diagnostics, memory addresses, or communication protocols. However, standard data type limitations and lack of built-in conversion tools in some PLCs make it challenging to safely convert large decimal values (up to 10 digits) into hex. Failing to handle edge cases—such as overflows or unsupported value ranges—can lead to runtime errors or incorrect results.

⸻

🟩 A (After) – The Desired Outcome

Develop a self-contained function block in IEC 61131-3 Structured Text that converts a 10-digit decimal value to its hexadecimal representation. The function block should:
	•	Accept a large decimal input (e.g., up to 9999999999)
	•	Perform accurate conversion to a hex string
	•	Handle edge cases, such as values at or beyond the upper limit of the platform’s numeric range
	•	Return the result as a STRING or ARRAY of characters for easy integration with HMI, logging, or communication logic

⸻

🟧 B (Bridge) – How to Get There
	1.	Define the function block interface with inputs like:
	•	DecValue : DINT or LINT (depending on platform)
	2.	Use internal logic to:
	•	Loop through the value using modulo and division by 16
	•	Convert numeric remainders (0–15) into corresponding ASCII hex characters ('0'..'F')
	•	Build the hex string in reverse, then output it correctly
	3.	Output:
	•	HexString : STRING or equivalent
	4.	Add input validation and comments to explain logic and platform-specific constraints.

🟨 B-A-B (Bridge-to-After-Bridge) – The Actual Implementation

```
FUNCTION BLOCK DecToHex
VAR_INPUT
    DecValue : DINT; // 10-digit decimal value
END_VAR
VAR_OUTPUT
    HexString : STRING; // Hexadecimal representation of the decimal value
END_VAR

// Input validation
IF (DecValue < 0) THEN
    RETURN;
END_IF

// Convert the decimal value to hexadecimal
FOR i = 1 TO 10
    HexDigit = MOD(DecValue, 16);
    DecValue = DIV(DecValue, 16);
    IF (HexDigit > 10) THEN
        HexDigit = 10 + (HexDigit - 10); // Convert to A-F
    END_IF
    HexString = CONCAT(HexString, CHAR(HexDigit));
END_FOR

// Return the hexadecimal string
RETURN HexString;
```

🟩 – A (After) – The Result

The function block `DecToHex` now safely converts a 10-digit decimal value to its hexadecimal representation. It handles large values, edge cases, and can be easily integrated with other logic in industrial automation applications.
