### Intent:
**Intent Summary:**  
Develop an ISA-88-compliant batch control program in IEC 61131-3 Structured Text to automate the adhesive production process, focusing on the Reaction step (B.2) with sequential operations (heating, mixing, holding) managed via modular logic, timers, and state transitions.

### Prompt:
**Batch Adhesive:**

Develop an ISA-88 batch control recipe for the production of adhesive, detailing the stages involved in the process. Create a self-contained program in IEC 61131-3 Structured Text to manage the sequential control of step B.2, Reaction, with specific process parameters and timers. Include the necessary control logic to call methods corresponding to each phase of the reaction, ensuring that transitions between steps are managed through appropriate conditions and timer values.

Incorporate detailed content for calling the methods that govern specific operations, such as heating, mixing, and maintaining the reaction environment. Additionally, discuss the integration of ISA-88 standards in batch process control, focusing on how the structured text program facilitates modularity and flexibility in controlling the adhesive production process.

ðŸŸ¥ R (Role) â€“ Define Your Role

Act as a control systems engineer implementing ISA-88-compliant batch processes using IEC 61131-3 Structured Text.

ðŸŸ© I (Input) â€“ Information Provided

You are developing a batch control system for adhesive production, specifically focusing on step B.2: Reaction. The process includes multiple operations such as heating, mixing, and holding, each with specific parameters and timing requirements. The system must follow ISA-88 standards for modularity and procedural abstraction. Your goal is to create a self-contained Structured Text program that controls this step and integrates smoothly into the full batch recipe.

ðŸŸ§ S (Steps) â€“ Implementation Steps
	1.	Design an ISA-88-compliant recipe structure that outlines the main stages of adhesive production, with clear focus on the Reaction step.
	2.	Develop Structured Text methods or function blocks to control operations like StartHeating, StartMixing, and HoldReaction, including input parameters (e.g., temperature, speed, time).
	3.	Implement sequential control logic that manages transitions between phases using timers and real-time conditions.
	4.	Ensure the code structure is modular, with reusable components and clear state handling, consistent with ISA-88 procedural models.

ðŸŸ¦ E (Expectation) â€“ Expected Outcome

Deliver a Structured Text program that performs step B.2 of the batch adhesive recipe reliably and in compliance with ISA-88. The program should facilitate easy integration with other batch stages, support reuse of control logic, and enhance clarity, safety, and flexibility in the adhesive manufacturing process.

**Batch Adhesive Recipe:**

The adhesive production process consists of the following stages:

1. Preparation (A)
	* Raw material preparation
	* Equipment setup
2. Feed (B.1)
	* Raw material feeding
	* Mixing
3. Reaction (B.2)
	* Heating
	* Mixing
	* Holding
4. Workup (C)
	* Solids removal
	* Filtration
5. Finishing (D)
	* Drying
	* Packaging

**Reaction Step (B.2) Control:**

To control the Reaction step (B.2), we will create a Structured Text program with the following components:

1. Variables
	* Temperature (T)
	* Speed (S)
	* Time (t)
	* Reaction state (ReactionState)
2. Methods
	* StartHeating(T_setpoint, T_min, T_max, t_hold)
		+ Set temperature setpoint
		+ Start heating
		+ Wait until temperature reaches setpoint
		+ Hold temperature for t_hold
	* StartMixing(S_setpoint, t_mix)
		+ Set speed setpoint
		+ Start mixing
		+ Wait until speed reaches setpoint
		+ Mix for t_mix
	* HoldReaction(t_hold)
		+ Hold temperature and speed constant
		+ Wait for t_hold
3. Sequential control logic
	* If ReactionState = "Heating"
		+ Call StartHeating method
	* Else if ReactionState = "Mixing"
		+ Call StartMixing method
	* Else if ReactionState = "Holding"
		+ Call HoldReaction method
	* Else
		+ Set ReactionState to "Heating" and call StartHeating method
4. Timer management
	* Create timers for each phase (HeatingTimer, MixingTimer, HoldingTimer)
	* Update timers at each program cycle
	* Check timer values to transition between phases
