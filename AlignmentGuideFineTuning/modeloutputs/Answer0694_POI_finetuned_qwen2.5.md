### Intent:
The task involves creating an ASCII-based Function Block Diagram (FBD) for a basic control loop with an analog input feeding a timer and PID block, where only the PID output drives an analog output, including labeled signals for clarity in text-based documentation.  

*(For the penicillin fermentation PFD, the intent is:)*  
**"Document a 10,000L penicillin fermentation batch process using text-based PFD notation, detailing equipment, instrumentation, control loops (PID for flow/level/temp/pH/DO), safety interlocks, and alarms for PLC implementation."**

### Prompt:
**FBD PID:**

Create a 61131-3 function block diagram in ASCII art. It shall contain an analog input, a timer block, and a PID block as well as an analog output. The analog input feeds both the timer and the PID block. Only the PID block is connected to the analog output. Provide typical input and output signals for each function block and show them inside each block.

ðŸŸ© I (Input) â€“ Information Provided

You need to create an ASCII art diagram representing a simple control structure that includes:
	â€¢	An Analog Input block
	â€¢	A TON (Timer On Delay) block
	â€¢	A PID control block
	â€¢	An Analog Output block

The logic flow should follow these rules:
	â€¢	The Analog Input feeds both the Timer and the PID block
	â€¢	Only the PID output (CV) is connected to the Analog Output input (IN)
	â€¢	Each block must show typical signal names, like IN, OUT, ET, PV, SP, CV

â¸»

ðŸŸ§ S (Steps) â€“ Steps to Perform
	1.	Create ASCII block shapes (e.g., using +-----+) to represent each function block.
	2.	Place signal names inside each block:
	â€¢	For AnalogInput: OUT = AI
	â€¢	For TON: IN = AI, ET = ET, Q = Q
	â€¢	For PID: PV = AI, SP = 50.0, CV = CV
	â€¢	For AnalogOutput: IN = CV
	3.	Connect the blocks using arrows (-->) to show signal flow:
	â€¢	AI â†’ TON and PID
	â€¢	CV â†’ Analog Output
	4.	Keep the layout clean, aligned, and readable for quick understanding in plain-text tools.

ðŸŸ¦ E (Expectation) â€“ Expected Outcome

The result should be a functional, clearly labeled ASCII-based FBD diagram that can be used in technical documentation, version-controlled code repositories, or design review notes. It allows stakeholders to understand the signal flow, block behavior, and interface structure even without graphical tools.
