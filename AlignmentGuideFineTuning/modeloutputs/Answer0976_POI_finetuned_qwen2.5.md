ðŸŸ¦ G (Goal)

Deliver a modular, scan-cycle-safe function block that produces reliable estimates of position and velocity despite measurement noise. The block should be easy to configure, integrate into motion control logic, and adaptable for various autonomous or mobile platform applications. Ensure that the implementation is self-contained, with all required variables and logic encapsulated within the function block, and that it is designed to handle real-time constraints and scan-cycle safety.
