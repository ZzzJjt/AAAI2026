### Intent:
**Intent Summary:**  
Create an iterative, IEC 61131-3-compliant heapsort function block in Structured Text to efficiently sort integer arrays in industrial PLCs without recursion or `DOWNTO` loops, ensuring deterministic performance for automation tasks like prioritization or sensor data ordering.

### Prompt:
**Heapsort:**
Implement a self-contained function block in IEC 61131-3 structured text to perform the heapsort algorithm on an array of integers without using recursion or the â€˜DOWNTOâ€™ keyword in loops. Ensure efficient heap construction and sorting.


**C-A-R-E:**

ðŸŸ¥ C (Context) â€“ Background Situation

Sorting is a critical operation in automation systems where arrays of sensor values, priorities, or process states must be ordered efficiently. Heapsort is a reliable, in-place algorithm with a consistent time complexity of O(n log n), making it ideal for PLC environments. However, in IEC 61131-3 Structured Text, recursion and the DOWNTO keyword are often unsupported or discouraged, requiring a fully iterative approach suitable for scan-cycle-based systems.

ðŸŸ© A (Action) â€“ Task to Perform

Develop a self-contained function block in Structured Text to perform heapsort on an array of integers. The block must:
	â€¢	Use only iterative loops (i.e., no recursion)
	â€¢	Avoid the DOWNTO keyword (use ascending index logic where needed)
	â€¢	Construct a max heap iteratively
	â€¢	Sort the array in-place for memory efficiency
	â€¢	Be modular and include clear input/output definitions and internal heapify routines

â¸»

ðŸŸ¨ R (Result) â€“ Expected Outcome

The result should be a robust and scan-cycle-compatible function block capable of sorting an integer array within IEC 61131-3-compliant systems. It should:
	â€¢	Efficiently order values using heapsort
	â€¢	Maintain code readability and modularity
	â€¢	Be deployable across a variety of automation tasks (e.g., event ranking, control prioritization)
	â€¢	Avoid unsupported language features while delivering deterministic execution time

â¸»

ðŸŸ¦ E (Example) â€“ Concrete Illustration

Sample heapify logic (non-recursive):

FOR I := HeapSize / 2 TO 1 BY -1 DO
   CALL Heapify(InputArray, I, HeapSize);
END_FOR;

Instead of DOWNTO, this loop could be transformed using ascending logic and index math (e.g., FOR I := 1 TO HeapSize / 2 DO with adjusted indexing logic inside the Heapify).

The final function block might include:
	â€¢	InputArray : ARRAY[1..N] OF INT
	â€¢	SortedArray : ARRAY[1..N] OF INT
	â€¢	Execute : BOOL
	â€¢	Done : BOOL

	â€¢	HeapSort : FUNCTION (InputArray : ARRAY[1..N] OF INT) : VOID

The Heapify function would be called iteratively to construct the heap, and the HeapSort function would use the heapify routine to sort the array in-place.

ðŸŸ§ R (Rationale) â€“ Why is this important?

Heapsort is a valuable sorting algorithm for automation systems due to its efficiency and in-place nature. By developing a fully iterative, IEC 61131-3-compliant implementation, we can ensure that the algorithm can be reliably used in PLC environments without the need for recursion or the DOWNTO keyword. This will allow for consistent, deterministic performance in tasks like event ranking or control prioritization, enhancing the overall efficiency and reliability of automation systems.
