### Intent:
The task is to develop an ISA-88-compliant batch control program in IEC 61131-3 Structured Text for aspirin production, automating the reaction, crystallization, and drying phases with precise temperature, pressure, and timing controls.

### Prompt:
**Batch Aspirin:**

Develop an ISA-88 batch control recipe for the production of aspirin (acetylsalicylic acid), outlining the process stages and the physical structure, which includes a reactor, crystallizer, centrifuge, and dryer. The process involves the following educts: acetic anhydride, salicylic acid, and sulfuric acid as a catalyst, with products being acetylsalicylic acid and acetic acid. The drying stage should occur at 90Â°C.

Write a self-contained program in IEC 61131-3 Structured Text for the sequential control of the reaction stage, incorporating typical parameter values for temperature, pressure, and timing. Ensure that the program logic follows the batch control principles of ISA-88, with clear transitions between operations like heating, mixing, and reaction completion. Additionally, include control parameters for initiating and managing the crystallization and drying phases, ensuring that temperature and time controls are accurate.

**Batch Control Recipe:**

1. **Reactor Stage:**
	- **Heating:** Start heating the reactor to 100Â°C with a ramp rate of 5Â°C/min.
	- **Mixing:** Once the temperature reaches 100Â°C, initiate mixing at 50 rpm.
	- **Reaction:** After 2 hours of mixing, start the reaction by adding the catalyst (sulfuric acid) and maintain the temperature at 100Â°C for 4 hours.
	- **Hold:** After the reaction, hold the temperature at 100Â°C for 1 hour to ensure complete conversion.
	- **Cooling:** Gradually cool the reaction mixture to 50Â°C at a rate of 2Â°C/min.

2. **Crystallization Stage:**
	- **Crystallization:** Once the temperature reaches 50Â°C, initiate the crystallization process by adding acetic anhydride and salicylic acid. Maintain the temperature at 50Â°C for 2 hours.
	- **Centrifugation:** After 2 hours, centrifuge the mixture to separate the aspirin crystals from the mother liquor.

3. **Drying Stage:**
	- **Drying:** Transfer the aspirin crystals to the dryer and maintain a temperature of 90Â°C for 2 hours.
	- **Cooling:** Gradually cool the aspirin to room temperature at a rate of 2Â°C/min.

**Program Structure:**

The program should be structured according to the ISA-88 batch control principles, with phases and operations clearly defined. The program should include the following phases:

1. **Reactor Phase:**
