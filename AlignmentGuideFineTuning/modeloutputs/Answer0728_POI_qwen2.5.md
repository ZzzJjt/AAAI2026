### Intent:
**Intent Summary:**  
Design a motor interlock system in IEC 61131-3 Structured Text to prevent motor startup if associated equipment is running, ensuring safe coordinated operation with audit logging for industrial control applications.

### Prompt:
**Interlock Prilling Station:**

Develop a complete list of interlocks required for a prilling station handling ammonium nitrates. The interlocks should cover critical safety and operational aspects to ensure the safe and efficient operation of the prilling process. Discuss the importance of implementing these interlocks in ammonium nitrate production for both safety and compliance with regulatory standards.

**R-T-F:**

ðŸŸ¥ R (Role) â€“ Your Role

Act as a process control or safety systems engineer tasked with designing interlocks for a prilling station that handles ammonium nitrate, a highly reactive and regulated chemical compound.

ðŸŸ© T (Task) â€“ What You Need to Do

Create a comprehensive list of interlocks necessary for the safe and efficient operation of an ammonium nitrate prilling station. For each interlock, clearly define:
	â€¢	The hazardous condition being monitored (e.g., overtemperature, overpressure, loss of air flow)
	â€¢	The trigger value or fault (e.g., cooling air flow < minimum, temperature > threshold)
	â€¢	The automated safety response (e.g., stop melt feed, shut down prilling tower, open vent valve)

The interlocks should address at least the following conditions:
	1.	Overtemperature in the prill tower
	2.	High pressure in melt system
	3.	Cooling air failure
	4.	Melt pump or feeder failure
	5.	High product accumulation
	6.	Scrubber failure or bypass
	7.	Emergency stop trigger
	8.	Loss of inerting gas (if applicable)
	9.	Power failure
	10.	Explosion vent activation

Explain the importance of these interlocks in preventing catastrophic outcomes, complying with safety regulations (e.g., OSHA, ATEX), and protecting operators and the environment.

ðŸŸ§ F (Format) â€“ Expected Output

Deliver a clear and structured output that includes:
	â€¢	A numbered list of interlocks with each oneâ€™s monitored condition, trigger threshold, and safety action
	â€¢	A brief description of the system logic for activation and reset (manual or automatic)
	â€¢	A summary paragraph explaining how these interlocks contribute to process safety, regulatory compliance, and equipment protection

Optional: Provide a draft of how these interlocks could be implemented in IEC 61131-3 Structured Text or as a cause-and-effect matrix.

Optional: Provide a draft of how these interlocks could be implemented in IEC 61131-3 Structured Text or as a cause-and-effect matrix. **Interlock Prilling Station:**

**1. Overtemperature in the prill tower**
	â€¢	Monitored condition: Temperature of the prill tower
	â€¢	Trigger threshold: 120Â°C
	â€¢	Safety action: Stop melt feed, shut down prilling tower, open vent valve
	â€¢	System logic: If temperature exceeds 120Â°C, stop melt feed and shut down prilling tower. Open vent valve to release pressure.

**2. High pressure in melt system**
	â€¢	Monitored condition: Pressure in the melt system
	â€¢	Trigger threshold: 10 bar
	â€¢	Safety action: Stop melt feed, shut down prilling tower, open vent valve
	â€¢	System logic: If pressure exceeds 10 bar, stop melt feed and shut down prilling tower. Open vent valve to release pressure.

**3. Cooling air failure**
	â€¢	Monitored condition: Cooling air flow
	â€¢	Trigger threshold: < 50% of minimum flow
	â€¢	Safety action: Stop melt feed, shut down prilling tower, open vent valve
	â€¢	System logic: If cooling air flow falls below 50% of the minimum flow, stop melt feed and shut down prilling tower. Open vent valve to release pressure.
