The function block should be compatible with IEC 61131-3 Structured Text and be executable in a real-time environment.

**Kalman Filter:**

A Kalman filter is a mathematical algorithm used to estimate variables that can't be measured directly. In the context of autonomous vehicles, it can be used to estimate the vehicle's position and velocity based on noisy sensor data. The Kalman filter works by combining a mathematical model of the vehicle's motion with the noisy sensor data to produce estimates of the vehicle's state.

The Kalman filter consists of two main stages: prediction and update. In the prediction stage, the filter uses the mathematical model of the vehicle's motion to predict the vehicle's position and velocity at the next time step. In the update stage, the filter uses the noisy sensor data to correct the predicted position and velocity.

The Kalman filter has several configurable parameters, including the process noise covariance (Q), measurement noise covariance (R), and sample time (DeltaT). These parameters can be adjusted to optimize the filter's performance for a specific application.

The Kalman filter is a powerful tool for estimating the state of an autonomous vehicle, but it requires careful tuning and configuration to produce accurate results. The function block should be designed to be easy to configure and integrate into motion control logic, and should be adaptable for various autonomous or mobile platform applications.
