🟦 G (Goal) – What You Want to Achieve

Deliver a reliable, efficient, and well-documented function block that enables PLCs to perform on-device optimization using linear programming. This allows for:
	•	Autonomous decision-making in production systems
	•	Optimization of resource allocation, batch blending, or energy usage
	•	Integration of optimization logic directly into real-time control loops without relying on external systems

**Example Application:**

A chemical plant needs to optimize the blending of raw materials to meet product specifications while minimizing costs. The SimplexSolver function block can be used to determine the optimal quantities of each raw material to blend, ensuring compliance with constraints such as purity levels and cost limits, all while running on the PLC in real-time.

**Limitations:**

While the SimplexSolver function block is designed to be efficient and robust, it has limitations:
	•	Memory constraints: The function block may not be suitable for very large problems due to memory limitations in PLCs.
	•	Processing power: The algorithm's performance may degrade with increasing problem size, especially on slower PLCs.
	•	Floating-point accuracy: The use of floating-point arithmetic can introduce rounding errors, which may affect the accuracy of the solution.

**Conclusion:**

The SimplexSolver function block provides a powerful tool for on-device optimization in industrial PLC environments. By implementing the Simplex method in Structured Text, it enables real-time decision-making and optimization of various processes, such as resource allocation and batch blending. However, it is important to consider the limitations of the implementation, particularly with respect to memory and processing power, when applying this function block in industrial settings.
