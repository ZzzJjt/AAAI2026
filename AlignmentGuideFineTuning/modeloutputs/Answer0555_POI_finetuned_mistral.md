### Intent:
**Intent Summary:**  
Develop a PID control program in IEC 61131-3 Structured Text to regulate chlorine dosing at 3 ppm in a water treatment plant, using real-time flow feedback and safety limits to ensure precise chemical concentration under dynamic conditions.  

*(Key focus: PID control, chemical dosing, safety limits, real-time regulation)*

### Prompt:
**PID Flow Control Water Treatment:**

Develop a self-contained IEC 61131-3 Structured Text program to implement PID feedback control for chemical dosing in a water treatment process. The program should regulate the dosing rate of chlorine at 3 ppm, adjusting based on real-time flow measurements with a sampling rate of 100 ms.

The control logic should include PID parameters (proportional, integral, and derivative gains) that are tuned for maintaining the desired dosing concentration. Ensure the program accounts for any deviations from the setpoint and adjusts the chemical dosing accordingly, while including safety limits to prevent overdosing or underdosing. Discuss the importance of precise flow control in water treatment, with a focus on maintaining safe and effective chemical levels.
