# PID Control Loop

## Description

The PID control loop is a feedback control system that adjusts the output of a process to maintain a desired setpoint. The PID controller consists of three components: proportional, integral, and derivative. The proportional term adjusts the output based on the difference between the setpoint and the current output, the integral term accumulates the error over time, and the derivative term calculates the rate of change of the error. The controller adjusts the output to minimize the error and maintain the setpoint.

## Inputs

- **Setpoint**: The desired output of the process.
- **Current Output**: The actual output of the process.
- **Kp**: The proportional gain.
- **Ki**: The integral gain.
- **Kd**: The derivative gain.

## Output

- **Output**: The adjusted output of the process.
