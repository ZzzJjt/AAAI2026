🟥 R (Role) – Define Your Role

Act as a PLC developer designing a recursive-free quicksort function block in IEC 61131-3 Structured Text for efficient integer array sorting in real-time control applications.

⸻

🟩 I (Input) – Information Provided

You are tasked with implementing a quicksort algorithm that:
	•	Sorts an array of integers
	•	Avoids recursion and the use of unsupported syntax
	•	Is scan-cycle-safe and executable on standard PLCs
	•	Uses an iterative approach with internal stack simulation for managing subarray ranges
	•	Accepts a trigger (Execute) and returns a Done status after sorting

⸻

🟧 S (Steps) – Steps to Perform
	1.	Define the function block with inputs:
	•	InputArray : ARRAY[1..N] OF INT
	•	Execute : BOOL
	2.	Add internal state variables:
	•	StackPointer : INT
	•	Two arrays: LowStack, HighStack for subarray bounds
	•	Pivot, i, j for partitioning
	3.	On Execute = TRUE:
	•	Initialize the stack with the full array bounds
	•	Use a WHILE or REPEAT loop to simulate recursive calls:
	•	Pop a range from the stack
	•	Partition the subarray
	•	Push the resulting left and right subranges (if valid) back onto the stack
	4.	Implement the partition logic (e.g., Lomuto or Hoare scheme) as a subroutine or inline code
	5.	Mark sorting as Done when the stack is empty and all ranges are processed

🟦 E (Expectation) – Expected Outcome

Deliver a robust, recursive-free quicksort function block that:
	•	Sorts integer arrays in place using an efficient and well-commented algorithm
	•	Runs safely in a scan-cycle environment without risking stack overflows
	•	Is modular, easy to tune or extend, and reusable across various PLC applications that require real-time data sorting

🟪 A (Action) – What You Did

Developed a self-contained quicksort function block in IEC 61131-3 Structured Text, ensuring it is recursive-free, stack-safe, and optimized for real-time sorting of integer arrays in PLCs. The function block handles array partitioning and recursion using an internal stack simulation, allowing for efficient sorting without relying on recursion or unsupported syntax.

**C-A-S-E:**

🟥 C (Context) – Background and Situation

In industrial control systems, sorting large arrays of integers is a common task that requires efficient algorithms to ensure real-time performance. Traditional quicksort implementations often rely on recursion, which can lead to stack overflow issues in PLCs with limited memory. To address this, a non-recursive quicksort function block was needed that could handle sorting in a scan-cycle-safe manner.

🟩 A (Action) – The Action You Took

To develop the quicksort function block, I focused on creating a self-contained algorithm that could efficiently sort integer arrays without relying on recursion. I used a stack-based approach to simulate the partitioning and recursion steps, ensuring that the algorithm could handle large arrays without risking stack overflow. I also made sure to include comments and modular code to make the function block easy to understand and maintain.

🟨 I (Impact) – The Result of Your Action

The resulting quicksort function block is a robust, non-recursive algorithm that can efficiently sort integer arrays in real-time PLC applications. By using an internal stack to manage subarray ranges, the function block avoids the risk of stack overflow and ensures that sorting can be performed safely within a scan cycle. The self-contained nature of the function block also makes it easy to integrate into larger control systems, ensuring that sorting tasks can be handled efficiently and reliably.

🟩 R (Reflection) – What You Learned

Developing a non-recursive quicksort function block in IEC 61131-3 Structured Text taught me the importance of efficient memory management in PLC applications. By using a stack-based approach to simulate recursion, I was able to create a robust algorithm that could handle large arrays without risking stack overflow. This experience also reinforced the importance of modular, well-documented code in industrial control systems, as it allows developers to easily understand and maintain complex algorithms. Overall, this exercise demonstrated the value of adapting standard algorithms to meet the
