### Intent:
**Intent Summary:**  
Create a reusable Structured Text function block to read and process diagnostic data from a Profibus DP slave device, including status, error codes, and communication health, with robust error handling and state management.  

*(Focus: Profibus DP diagnostics, ST implementation, fault-tolerant communication)*

### Prompt:
**Profibus DP Diagnostics Using 61131-3 Structured Text:**

Develop a self-contained 61131-3 structured text function block to read diagnostic data from a Profibus DP slave device. The function block should handle communication with the Profibus DP slave and retrieve diagnostic information such as device status, error codes, and communication health. Provide an explanation of the key steps in processing the diagnostic data, including request initiation, data retrieval, and error handling mechanisms.

**R-T-F:**

ðŸŸ¥ R (Role) â€“ Your Role

Act as a PLC developer tasked with building diagnostic tools using IEC 61131-3 Structured Text for Profibus DP networks.

â¸»

ðŸŸ© T (Task) â€“ What You Need to Do

Develop a self-contained Structured Text (ST) function block that reads diagnostic data from a Profibus DP slave device. The block should:
	â€¢	Initiate diagnostic requests to the specified slave
	â€¢	Retrieve and interpret data such as device status, communication health, and error codes
	â€¢	Handle timeouts and communication failures
	â€¢	Output status indicators and parsed diagnostic information to the PLC program

â¸»

ðŸŸ§ F (Format) â€“ Expected Output

Deliver a reusable IEC 61131-3 ST function block with:
	â€¢	Inputs:
	â€¢	Execute (BOOL): Triggers the diagnostic read
	â€¢	SlaveAddress (BYTE): Identifies the target slave
	â€¢	Timeout (TIME): Defines maximum wait time
	â€¢	Outputs:
	â€¢	Done (BOOL): TRUE when diagnostics are successfully retrieved
	â€¢	Busy (BOOL): TRUE while waiting for response
	â€¢	Error (BOOL): TRUE if the operation fails
	â€¢	ErrorID (DWORD): Error code for diagnostics
	â€¢	Optional: DeviceStatus, CommHealth, or structured diagnostic data

Include internal logic to detect a rising edge on Execute, track operation state, parse the diagnostic data, and handle communication faults gracefully.

Include internal logic to detect a rising edge on Execute, track operation state, parse the diagnostic data, and handle communication faults gracefully. Ensure the function block is modular and can be easily integrated into larger PLC programs.

**Example Code:**

```structuredtext
FUNCTION_BLOCK ProfibusDP_Diagnostics
VAR_INPUT
    Execute : BOOL; // Trigger diagnostic read
    SlaveAddress : BYTE; // Target slave address
    Timeout : TIME; // Maximum wait time
END_VAR

VAR_OUTPUT
    Done : BOOL; // Operation complete
    Busy : BOOL; // Operation in progress
    Error : BOOL; // Operation failed
    ErrorID : DWORD; // Error code
    // Optional: DeviceStatus, CommHealth, or structured diagnostic data
END_VAR

VAR
    // Internal variables for state management and data storage
END_VAR

METHOD InitiateDiagnostic : BOOL
    // Initialize diagnostic request
    // Return TRUE if successful, FALSE otherwise
END_METHOD

METHOD RetrieveDiagnosticData : BOOL
    // Send diagnostic request to the slave
    // Return TRUE if successful, FALSE otherwise
END_METHOD

METHOD ParseDiagnosticData : BOOL
    // Parse received data for status, error codes, and communication health
    // Return TRUE if successful, FALSE otherwise
END_METHOD

METHOD HandleTimeout : BOOL
    // Handle timeout during diagnostic request
    // Return TRUE if timeout is handled, FALSE otherwise
END_METHOD

METHOD HandleCommunicationFailure : BOOL
    // Handle communication failure during diagnostic request
    // Return TRUE if failure is handled, FALSE otherwise
END_METHOD

METHOD UpdateStatus : BOOL
    // Update internal status variables based on operation progress
    // Return TRUE if status is updated, FALSE otherwise
END_METHOD

METHOD ExecuteDiagnostic : BOOL
    // Main method to execute the diagnostic process
    // Return TRUE if diagnostic is executed, FALSE otherwise
END_METHOD
END_FUNCTION_BLOCK
```

**Explanation:**

This function block is designed to be a reusable component for reading diagnostic data from a Profibus DP slave device. It includes methods for initiating the diagnostic request, retrieving the data, parsing the data, handling timeouts, and managing communication failures. The internal state is tracked using boolean variables to indicate the operation's progress and status. The function block is triggered by an input signal (Execute) and outputs the results to the PLC program. The optional outputs can be customized based on the specific diagnostic data required by the application.
