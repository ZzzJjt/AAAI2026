### Intent:
**Intent Summary:**  
Develop a Python-based non-linear model predictive controller (NMPC) to optimize steam generator startup in power plants by minimizing time and energy while adhering to safety constraints, using modular code with clear documentation of the model, optimization, and control strategy.

### Prompt:
**Startup Steam Generator:**

Develop a non-linear model-predictive controller (NMPC) in Python to optimize the startup process of a steam generator in a power plant. The NMPC should be designed to handle the non-linear dynamics of the steam generation process, considering key variables such as pressure, temperature, and flow rates.
