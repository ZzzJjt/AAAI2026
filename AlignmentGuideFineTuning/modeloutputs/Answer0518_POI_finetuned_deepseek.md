ðŸŸ¥ R (Role) â€“ Your Role

You are a PLC programmer or control systems engineer developing statistical function blocks in IEC 61131-3 Structured Text to support real-time probabilistic event analysis in industrial systems.

â¸»

ðŸŸ© I (Input) â€“ What Youâ€™re Given

You need to implement a function block that calculates the Poisson distribution probability, given:
	â€¢	Lambda : REAL â€” the expected number of events (mean rate, Î»)
	â€¢	K : INT â€” the number of actual events observed

The output should be:
	â€¢	Probability : REAL â€” the probability that K events occur given a rate Lambda
	â€¢	Based on the Poisson probability mass function:
P(k; \lambda) = \frac{e^{-\lambda} \cdot \lambda^k}{k!}

You must also consider:
	â€¢	Overflow and precision loss with large values of Î» or k
	â€¢	Executing efficiently within a real-time PLC scan cycle
	â€¢	Proper domain checks (e.g., Lambda > 0, K â‰¥ 0)

â¸»

ðŸŸ§ S (Steps) â€“ What You Need to Do
	1.	Define a function block named PoissonProbability with the following structure:
 FUNCTION_BLOCK PoissonProbability
VAR_INPUT
    Lambda : REAL;
    K : INT;
END_VAR
VAR_OUTPUT
    Probability : REAL;
END_VAR
	2.	Add logic to calculate factorial for K:
 VAR
    i : INT;
    Factorial : REAL := 1.0;
END_VAR

FOR i := 1 TO K DO
    Factorial := Factorial * i;
END_FOR;
	3.	Compute the Poisson probability:
 IF (Lambda > 0) AND (K >= 0) THEN
    Probability := EXP(-Lambda) * POW(Lambda, K) / Factorial;
ELSE
    Probability := 0.0;
END_IF;
	4.	Add inline comments explaining:
	â€¢	Each step of the Poisson formula
	â€¢	Why factorial is manually computed (no built-in factorial in ST)
	â€¢	How floating-point math affects precision
	â€¢	Consideration of upper limits for K to prevent overflow

â¸»

ðŸŸ¦ E (Expectation) â€“ What Success Looks Like

You deliver a compact and accurate function block that:
	â€¢	Computes Poisson probabilities reliably for typical values of Lambda and K
	â€¢	Avoids crashing or incorrect output for edge cases (e.g. negative inputs)
	â€¢	Executes quickly enough for inclusion in real-time event monitoring applications
	â€¢	Can be reused in use cases such as:
	â€¢	Predicting machine failure rates
	â€¢	Sensor event tracking over time intervals
	â€¢	Process bottleneck analysis
