### Intent:
**Intent Summary:**  
Develop a C++ implementation of a wind farm control system using model predictive control (MPC) to optimize turbine pitch angles and energy storage dispatch, balancing power output with grid demand while maintaining operational constraints.

### Prompt:
**MATLAB Distillation Column Modeling and Control:**

ðŸŸ¥ Bï¼ˆBeforeï¼‰

Traditional methods for modeling and controlling distillation columns often fail to capture the complex dynamic interactions between feed rates and temperature, making it difficult to optimize performance under operational constraints.

ðŸŸ© Aï¼ˆAfterï¼‰

Develop a detailed MATLAB model that accurately represents the dynamic behavior of a distillation column, particularly the relationship between feed rates and temperature. Then, apply a model predictive control (MPC) strategy to optimize the distillation process in real time, ensuring efficient operation within specified constraintsâ€”all without producing any plots.

ðŸŸ§ Bï¼ˆBridgeï¼‰

Use MATLAB to construct a state-space or differential equation-based model of the distillation column. Implement the MPC algorithm using the built model to manage multivariable control and enforce constraints, focusing purely on the numerical output and optimization logic rather than graphical visualization.
