### Intent:
**Intent Summary:**  
Create a structured text function block to convert a 10-digit decimal value to hexadecimal in IEC 61131-3, handling large values and edge cases for industrial automation applications.

### Prompt:
**DecToHex:**
Implement a self-contained function block in IEC 61131-3 structured text to convert a 10-digit decimal value to hexadecimal. Ensure proper handling of large values and edge cases.

ðŸŸ¥ B (Before) â€“ The Problem or Challenge

In industrial automation systems, thereâ€™s often a need to display or log numerical data in hexadecimal format, especially for diagnostics, memory addresses, or communication protocols. However, standard data type limitations and lack of built-in conversion tools in some PLCs make it challenging to safely convert large decimal values (up to 10 digits) into hex. Failing to handle edge casesâ€”such as overflows or unsupported value rangesâ€”can lead to runtime errors or incorrect results.

ðŸŸ© A (After) â€“ The Desired Outcome

Develop a self-contained function block in IEC 61131-3 Structured Text that converts a 10-digit decimal value to its hexadecimal representation. The function block should:
	â€¢	Accept a large decimal input (e.g., up to 9999999999)
	â€¢	Perform accurate conversion to a hex string
	â€¢	Handle edge cases, such as values at or beyond the upper limit of the platformâ€™s numeric range
	â€¢	Return the result as a STRING or ARRAY of characters for easy integration with HMI, logging, or communication logic

â¸»

ðŸŸ§ B (Bridge) â€“ How to Get There
	1.	Define the function block interface with inputs like:
	â€¢	DecValue : DINT or LINT (depending on platform)
	2.	Use internal logic to:
	â€¢	Loop through the value using modulo and division by 16
	â€¢	Convert numeric remainders (0â€“15) into corresponding ASCII hex characters ('0'..'F')
	â€¢	Build the hex string in reverse, then output it correctly
	3.	Output:
	â€¢	HexString : STRING or equivalent
	4.	Add input validation and comments to explain logic and platform-specific constraints.

```

**Testing:**

Test the function block with a range of input values, including:
	â€¢	Small values (e.g., 123)
	â€¢	Large values (e.g., 9999999999)
	â€¢	Values at or beyond the upper limit of the platformâ€™s numeric range (e.g., 2147483647)
	â€¢	Values with leading zeros (e.g., 0000000001)
	â€¢	Values with trailing zeros (e.g., 1234567890)
	â€¢	Values with leading or trailing spaces (e.g., ' 1234567890')
	â€¢	Values with non-numeric characters (e.g., '1234567890A')
	â€¢	Values with negative signs (e.g., '-1234567890')
	â€¢	Values with leading or trailing spaces (e.g., ' 1234567890')
