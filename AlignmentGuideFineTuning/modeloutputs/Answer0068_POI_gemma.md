ðŸŸ¥ B (Before) â€“ The Challenge

In industrial systems, processes often involve event-driven behaviors, such as machine failures, sensor triggers, or counting occurrences over time. The Poisson distribution is widely used to model the probability of a given number of events occurring in a fixed time interval. However, most IEC 61131-3 Structured Text environments do not natively support statistical functions, making it difficult to apply this distribution directly in real-time PLC logic. Developers also face challenges handling large factorials and maintaining numerical stability when computing small probabilities.

**Poisson Distribution:**

The Poisson distribution is a probability distribution that describes the number of events occurring in a fixed interval of time or space, given the average rate of occurrence. It is often used to model the number of occurrences of rare events, such as machine failures, sensor triggers, or counting occurrences over time.

The Poisson distribution is characterized by a single parameter, Î», which represents the average rate of occurrence. The probability of observing k events in a given interval is given by the formula:

P(k; Î») = \frac{e^{-\lambda} \cdot \lambda^k}{k!}

where e is the base of the natural logarithm, k is the number of events, and k! is the factorial of k.

The Poisson distribution is widely used in industrial systems to model the probability of a given number of events occurring in a fixed time interval. For example, in a manufacturing process, the Poisson distribution can be used to model the probability of a machine failure occurring in a given time period. By understanding the average rate of occurrence of machine failures, a manufacturer can estimate the probability of a failure occurring and take appropriate action to minimize downtime and maintain production efficiency.

In the context of event-driven processes, the Poisson distribution can be used to model the probability of a sensor trigger occurring in a given time interval. By understanding the average rate of occurrence of sensor triggers, a system can be designed to respond appropriately to the event, such as triggering an alarm or initiating a corrective action.

The Poisson distribution is also useful in monitoring the number of occurrences of a given event over time. For example, in a communication system, the Poisson distribution can be used to model the probability of a communication packet being corrupted or lost. By understanding the average rate of occurrence of corrupted or lost packets, a system can be designed to minimize the impact of these events on the overall communication process.

In summary, the Poisson distribution is a powerful tool for modeling the probability of a given number of events occurring in a fixed time interval. It is widely used in industrial systems to model the probability of machine failures, sensor triggers, and other rare events, and can
