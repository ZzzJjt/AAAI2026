### Intent:
The task is to **create a structured text program for a traffic light control system that manages standard light sequences, pedestrian crossings, and emergency vehicle prioritization while ensuring safe and efficient traffic flow**.

### Prompt:
**Traffic Light Control System Using 61131-3 Structured Text:**

Write a self-contained 61131-3 structured text program (not a function block) to control a traffic light system. The system should respond to pedestrian push buttons, allowing safe crossing by adjusting traffic light timings accordingly. Additionally, the system must detect the presence of emergency vehicles and prioritize their passage by adjusting the light sequence to provide a clear path. Implement logic to ensure smooth traffic flow while giving priority to safety and emergency response.

**C-A-R-E:**

ðŸŸ¥ C (Context) â€“ The Background

Traffic light systems must ensure safe pedestrian crossings, maintain efficient vehicle flow, and provide emergency vehicle prioritization. In smart cities and industrial environments, programmable logic controllers (PLCs) using IEC 61131-3 Structured Text can manage these complex requirements reliably. A well-structured program must integrate timing logic, sensor inputs, and conditional branching to coordinate all system elements.

ðŸŸ© A (Action) â€“ The Implementation Task

Write a self-contained Structured Text (ST) program that:
	â€¢	Operates a traffic light with standard sequences: Red â†’ Green â†’ Yellow
	â€¢	Handles pedestrian push buttons by inserting a safe red light hold for crossing
	â€¢	Detects emergency vehicles and immediately grants green signal to clear the path
	â€¢	Resumes normal traffic cycles after special events
	â€¢	Ensures non-conflicting transitions with timer-based state control

â¸»

ðŸŸ¨ R (Result) â€“ The Expected Outcome

The resulting control system will:
	â€¢	Prioritize safety by reliably managing pedestrian crossings
	â€¢	Improve response time for emergency vehicles using sensor-based overrides
	â€¢	Maintain smooth and efficient traffic flow through coordinated timing
	â€¢	Be modular, readable, and scalable, suitable for integration into broader urban traffic networks
