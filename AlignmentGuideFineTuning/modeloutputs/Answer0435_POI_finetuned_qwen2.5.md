### Intent:
**Intent Summary:**  
Develop an IEC 61131-3 Structured Text function block to reliably read five process values from an IO-Link master, with error handling and status reporting for robust communication diagnostics.  

*(Focus: IO-Link data acquisition, fault tolerance, and real-time status feedback in industrial automation.)*

### Prompt:
**IO-Link Data Acquisition Using 61131-3 Structured Text:**

Develop a function block in structured text (ST) based on IEC 61131 standards to read five values from a remote IO-Link master. The function block should handle communication with the IO-Link master, retrieve the required process data, and provide the status of each read operation. Discuss the methodology used for error checking, status reporting, and handling of potential communication issues between the IO-Link master and the connected devices.

**R-I-S-E:**

ðŸŸ¥ R (Role) â€“ Your Role

Act as an industrial automation engineer developing IEC 61131-3 Structured Text (ST) function blocks for device-level communication using IO-Link.

ðŸŸ© I (Input) â€“ What Youâ€™re Given

You need to create a function block that communicates with a remote IO-Link master to read five process values. The block must manage communication with the master, handle potential read errors, and report the status of each read operation. Reliability, fault tolerance, and status transparency are essential.

ðŸŸ§ S (Steps) â€“ What to Do
	1.	Define input parameters to initiate reading and identify IO-Link channels or data objects.
	2.	Implement logic to communicate with the IO-Link master and sequentially or concurrently retrieve five process values.
	3.	For each read, verify the result and generate a corresponding status output (e.g., success, timeout, CRC error).
	4.	Add error-handling routines to retry failed reads or flag issues to the controller, ensuring traceability and real-time feedback.

ðŸŸ¦ E (Expectation) â€“ What Success Looks Like

The resulting function block should reliably read five values from an IO-Link master, return those values along with individual read statuses, and provide built-in error detection. This enables real-time diagnostics, enhances data integrity, and ensures robust IO-Link communication under varying network conditions.

**T-A-G:**

ðŸŸ¥ T (Task) â€“ What You Need to Do

Create a self-contained function block in IEC 61131-3 Structured Text to read five process values from an IO-Link master, including error handling and status reporting.

ðŸŸ© A (Action) â€“ How to Do It

	1.	Define the function block inputs and outputs:
	â€¢	Inputs:
	â€¢	â€¢	Enable: BOOL â€” triggers the read process
	â€¢	â€¢	IO-Link Handle: DWORD â€” identifier for the IO-Link master connection
	â€¢	â€¢	Process Data: ARRAY[1..5] OF REAL â€” buffer to store the read values
	â€¢	â€¢	Process Data Done: ARRAY[1..5] OF BOOL â€” status flags for each read operation
	â€¢	â€¢	Process Data Error: ARRAY[1..5] OF BOOL â€” error flags for each read operation
	â€¢	â€¢	Process Data Error Text: ARRAY[1..5] OF STRING â€” error descriptions for each read operation
	2.	Implement the logic to read five values from the IO-Link master:
	â€¢	Use a CASE statement to sequentially read each value, handling communication with the IO-Link master.
	â€¢	For each read, check the result and set the corresponding status flags and error messages.
	â€¢	Include error handling to manage communication failures, timeouts, or protocol errors.
	3.	Provide detailed comments explaining the function blockâ€™s operation, including error detection and status reporting mechanisms.

ðŸŸ§ G (Goal) â€“ What Youâ€™re Aiming For

Develop a function block that:
	â€¢	Reliably reads five process values from an IO-Link master
	â€¢	Handles communication errors and provides status feedback for each read
	â€¢	Ensures real-time diagnostics and fault tolerance in industrial automation systems
	â€¢	Works within the constraints of IEC 61131-3 Structured Text for clarity and maintainability
	â€¢	Is reusable and modular for integration into larger automation programs
	â€¢	Includes detailed comments for documentation and understanding
	â€¢	Is designed for use in environments where IO-Link communication reliability is critical
	â€¢	Works with typical IO-Link devices and controllers, such as Profibus DP, Profinet, or EtherCAT,
