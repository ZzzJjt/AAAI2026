### Intent:
**Intent Summary:**  
Design a motor interlock function block in IEC 61131-3 Structured Text that prevents motor startup if any monitored equipment is running, ensuring safe operation by evaluating Boolean inputs (equipment statuses) and outputting an enable signal only when all are stopped.  

*(Focus: Safety interlock logic to block motor start during unsafe conditions.)*

### Prompt:
**Motor Interlock Function Block Diagram:**

Design a motor interlock as a function block diagram that prevents the motor from starting while other associated equipment is still running. The interlock should monitor the operational status of surrounding equipment and block the motor start command if any equipment is still active. Include inputs from sensors or status indicators and outputs that control the motor start circuit.

Provide the implementation of the MotorInterlock function block in IEC 61131-3 Structured Text. This function block should check the statuses of relevant equipment (e.g., EquipmentRunning), and if all equipment is stopped, it should allow the motor to start by setting the output to TRUE. If any equipment is still running, the output should remain FALSE, preventing the motor from starting.

Discuss the role of motor interlocks in industrial safety and how this logic prevents premature or unsafe motor operation.

ðŸŸ© I (Input) â€“ What Youâ€™re Given

You must design a function block diagram and implement it in code. The function block will:
	â€¢	Accept multiple Boolean inputs (Equipment1Running, Equipment2Running, etc.) representing the status of nearby equipment
	â€¢	Evaluate whether the motor can start safely
	â€¢	Output a Boolean value (AllowStart) that permits the motor to start only if all inputs are FALSE
	â€¢	Prevent startup if any equipment is still running

ðŸŸ§ S (Steps) â€“ What You Need to Do
	1.	Define the function block interface:
	â€¢	Inputs: statuses of all relevant equipment
	â€¢	Output: AllowStart, which becomes TRUE only if all inputs are FALSE
	2.	Implement the logic in Structured Text:

 FUNCTION_BLOCK MotorInterlock
VAR_INPUT
    Equipment1Running : BOOL;
    Equipment2Running : BOOL;
    Equipment3Running : BOOL;
END_VAR
VAR_OUTPUT
    AllowStart : BOOL;
END_VAR

AllowStart := NOT Equipment1Running AND NOT Equipment2Running AND NOT Equipment3Running;

	3.	Integrate the function block into the main program, linking it to the motor start circuit or HMI control logic.
	4.	Document the logic and explain its safety purpose in both functional and operator terms.

ðŸŸ¦ E (Expectation) â€“ What Success Looks Like

You deliver a modular, reusable, and fault-resilient interlock function block that:
	â€¢	Ensures motors cannot start while other critical equipment is active
	â€¢	Enhances system safety and prevents sequence conflicts
	â€¢	Contributes to compliance with industry safety standards (e.g., IEC 61508, ISO 13849)
	â€¢	Is easy to integrate, test, and maintain within a larger control system

**Explanation:**

The MotorInterlock function block is designed to prevent the motor from starting while other associated equipment is still running. This is crucial for ensuring safe operation in industrial settings. The function block takes Boolean inputs representing the statuses of nearby equipment (e.g., Equipment1Running, Equipment2Running, Equipment3Running). It then evaluates whether the motor can start safely by checking if all equipment is stopped. If all inputs are FALSE, the AllowStart output becomes TRUE, permitting the motor to start. If any equipment is still running, the output remains FALSE, preventing the motor from starting.

The MotorInterlock function block is a crucial component in industrial safety systems, as it prevents premature or unsafe motor operation. By ensuring that all associated equipment is safely shut down before the motor starts, the interlock function block contributes to compliance with industry safety standards (e.g., IEC 61508, ISO 13849).

The implementation of the MotorInterlock function block in Structured Text involves defining the function block interface, implementing the logic, and integrating it into the main program. The function block's modular design, reusability, and fault-resilience make it easy to integrate, test, and maintain within a larger control system.

In summary, the MotorInterlock function block is a critical component in ensuring safe operation in industrial settings. By preventing the motor from starting while other equipment is still running, it contributes to compliance with industry safety standards and enhances overall system safety.
