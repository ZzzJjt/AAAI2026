ðŸŸ¥ T (Task) â€“ What You Need to Do

Create a self-contained function block in IEC 61131-3 Structured Text that performs linear interpolation between two known data points.

â¸»

ðŸŸ© A (Action) â€“ How to Do It
	1.	Define a function block named LinearInterpolation with the following REAL inputs:
	â€¢	X1, Y1: First known point
	â€¢	X2, Y2: Second known point
	â€¢	X: The value at which interpolation should occur
	2.	Compute the interpolated output Y using the formula:
Y := Y1 + \frac{(X - X1) \times (Y2 - Y1)}{(X2 - X1)}
Add a conditional check to avoid division by zero:
IF X2 <> X1 THEN
    Y := Y1 + ((X - X1) * (Y2 - Y1)) / (X2 - X1);
ELSE
    Y := Y1; // Or use fallback logic
END_IF;
3.	Include inline comments that explain each part of the calculation.
	4.	Address floating-point rounding and real-time scan cycle constraints, ensuring the block runs efficiently in control applications.

ðŸŸ¦ G (Goal) â€“ What You Want to Achieve

Provide a reusable, lightweight, and accurate function block for linear interpolation that supports applications like:
	â€¢	Sensor signal scaling
	â€¢	Analog-to-digital conversion mapping
	â€¢	Dynamic setpoint adjustments

The function block must ensure safe, predictable results and be suitable for deployment in real-time PLC environments.

ðŸŸ§ S (Success) â€“ How to Measure It

The function block should meet the following criteria:
	1.	Accuracy: The interpolated output Y should be within 0.1% of the expected value for all valid input combinations.
	2.	Efficiency: The function block should complete its calculation within 1 millisecond for all valid input combinations.
	3.	Stability: The function block should handle input values that are outside the range of the known points without causing errors or undefined behavior.
	4.	Usability: The function block should be easy to understand and use, with clear documentation and inline comments that explain the mathematical formula and any potential issues.

**Function Block Design:**

The function block should have the following inputs and outputs:

Inputs:
â€¢	X1, Y1: First known point (REAL)
â€¢	X2, Y2: Second known point (REAL)
â€¢	X: The value at which interpolation should occur (REAL)

Outputs:
â€¢	Y: The interpolated output value (REAL)

The function block should also include the following features:

â€¢	Conditional check to avoid division by zero
â€¢	Inline comments explaining the mathematical formula and any potential issues
â€¢	Considerations for precision and potential rounding errors
â€¢	Function block efficiency and real-time responsiveness

**Function Block Example:**

```ST

        X1, Y1: REAL;
        X2, Y2: REAL;
        X: REAL;

        Y: REAL;
    END_VAR

    IF X2 <> X1 THEN
        Y := Y1 + ((X - X1) * (Y2 - Y1)) / (X2 - X1);
    ELSE
        Y := Y1; // Or use fallback logic
    END_IF;

END_FUNCTION_BLOCK

**Function Block Documentation:**

The LinearInterpolation function block performs linear interpolation between two known data points (X1, Y1) and (X2, Y2) at a given value X. The interpolated output Y is calculated using the formula:

Y = Y1 + ((X - X1) * (Y2 - Y1)) / (X2 - X1)

This formula ensures that the interpolated output is a continuous and smooth function between the two known points. The
