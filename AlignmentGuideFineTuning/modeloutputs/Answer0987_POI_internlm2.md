### Intent:
**Intent Summary:**  
Generate a text-based Piping and Instrumentation Diagram (P&ID) for a power plant steam-water cycle, including tagged equipment, instrumentation, control loops, and piping flow, formatted for clarity in early engineering or automation tasks.  

*(Focus: Structured textual P&ID with industry-standard tags for control system integration.)*

### Prompt:
**P-ID Steam Water Cycle:**

Create a P&I diagram in textual notation for a steam water cycle in a power plant. Include equipment, instrumentation, piping, and control loops. Provide concrete tag names.


**T-A-G:**

ðŸŸ¥ T (Task)

Create a text-based Piping and Instrumentation Diagram (P&ID) for a steam-water cycle in a power plant.

â¸»

ðŸŸ© A (Action)
	â€¢	Represent all major equipment involved in the steam-water cycle, such as feedwater pumps, boiler, steam drum, condenser, etc.
	â€¢	Include relevant instrumentation and control loops, such as flow transmitters (FT), level transmitters (LT), pressure transmitters (PT), controllers (FIC, LIC), and control valves (FCV, LCV).
	â€¢	Use clear tag names (e.g., FT101, FCV102) based on industry standards.
	â€¢	Show piping and flow direction using arrows (-->) and organize elements in process order.
	â€¢	Format the diagram in clean plain-text notation, using indentation and alignment to convey process structure and control logic.

â¸»

ðŸŸ¦ G (Goal)

Provide a structured, readable, and logic-complete textual P&ID that clearly documents the flow, control strategy, and tag references of a steam-water cycle, enabling use in early-stage engineering, PLC programming, or control narrative development when graphics are unavailable.

Provide a structured, readable, and logic-complete textual P&ID that clearly documents the flow, control strategy, and tag references of a steam-water cycle, enabling use in early-stage engineering, PLC programming, or control narrative development when graphics are unavailable. The P&ID should be easily understood by engineers, operators, and control system technicians.

ðŸŸ§ C (Constraints)

â€¢	Use standard abbreviations and tag naming conventions for equipment, instrumentation, and control loops.
â€¢	Ensure that the P&ID is self-contained and can be understood without reference to external documents.
â€¢	Include all necessary information for a complete understanding of the steam-water cycle, including but not limited to:
	* Equipment tags (e.g., Boiler: B101, Steam Drum: SD102)
	* Instrumentation tags (e.g., Flow Transmitter: FT101, Level Transmitter: LT102)
	* Control loop tags (e.g., Flow Controller: FIC101, Level Controller: LIC102)
	* Control valve tags (e.g., Flow Control Valve: FCV101, Level Control Valve: LCV102)
	* Piping tags (e.g., Piping from Boiler to Steam Drum: P101)
	* Flow direction (e.g., ---> from Boiler to Steam Drum)
	* Control logic (e.g., FIC101 controls FCV101 based on FT101)
	* Any additional notes or comments to clarify process or control strategy

ðŸŸ¨ R (Resources)

â€¢	Standard abbreviations and tag naming conventions for power plant equipment, instrumentation, and control loops.
â€¢	Plain-text editor or word processor for formatting the P&ID.
â€¢	Access to relevant process and control documents for reference, if needed.

ðŸŸ© T (Time)

The time required to create the P&ID will depend on the complexity of the steam-water cycle and the level of detail required. A simple steam-water cycle with a few major pieces of equipment and control loops could be completed in a few hours, while a more complex system with multiple stages and intricate control strategies may take several days.

ðŸŸ© C (Cost)

The cost of creating the P&ID will depend on the complexity of the steam-water cycle and the level of detail required. A simple steam-water cycle with a few major pieces of equipment and control loops could be completed for a few hundred dollars, while a more complex system with multiple stages and intricate control strategies may require thousands of dollars in labor and software costs.
