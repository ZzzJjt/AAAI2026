### Intent:
**Intent Summary:**  
Develop a PLC program in IEC 61131-3 Structured Text to control an automatic car wash station, ensuring safe operation by starting the wash cycle only when a car is detected and no humans are present, while immediately stopping and alarming if a human enters the wash zone.

### Prompt:
**Automatic Car Wash Station Control Using 61131-3 Structured Text:**

Write a PLC program in structured text (ST) according to IEC 61131-3 standards to control an automatic car wash station with a single wash bay. The system should use a sensor to detect the presence of a car. Once the car is detected and no human is present in the wash area, the system should initiate the car wash process. If a human is detected within the car wash area at any point, the station should immediately stop the wash process, trigger an alarm, and remain in a safe state until the area is clear.

**T-A-G:**

🟥 T (Task) – What You Need to Do

Develop a PLC control program in IEC 61131-3 Structured Text (ST) for managing a single-bay automatic car wash station. The system must ensure safe and autonomous operation, responding to both car and human presence in the wash area.

⸻

🟩 A (Action) – How to Do It
	1.	Use the following input signals:
	•	CarPresentSensor : BOOL — detects a car in the wash bay
	•	HumanDetectedSensor : BOOL — detects a person in the wash zone
	2.	Control the following outputs:
	•	WashActive : BOOL — starts/stops the wash process
	•	AlarmActive : BOOL — activates when a person is detected during wash
	•	SafeToRun : BOOL — internal flag that governs when a wash can safely begin
	3.	Implement the logic:
	•	If a human is detected, stop the wash, set AlarmActive := TRUE, and set SafeToRun := FALSE
	•	If a car is detected, no human is present, and the system is safe, start the wash (WashActive := TRUE)
	•	Once the area is clear and wash is stopped, reset the system (SafeToRun := TRUE) to allow new cycles
	4.	Example Structured Text snippet:
 CarPresent := CarPresentSensor;
HumanDetected := HumanDetectedSensor;

IF HumanDetected THEN
    WashActive := FALSE;
    AlarmActive := TRUE;
    SafeToRun := FALSE;
ELSIF CarPresent AND NOT HumanDetected AND SafeToRun THEN
    WashActive := TRUE;
    AlarmActive := FALSE;
END_IF;

IF NOT HumanDetected AND NOT WashActive THEN
    SafeToRun := TRUE;
END_IF;
5.	Document the logic:
	•	Explain interlock behavior and human override handling
	•	Include comments for safe state restoration and alarm reset behavior
	•	Ensure all transitions are clear and scan-time safe

⸻

🟦 G (Goal) – What You Want to Achieve

Deliver a safe, reliable, and standards-compliant control logic solution that:
	•	Automatically starts the wash cycle when conditions are safe
	•	Immediately stops and locks out the process if a human enters the zone
	•	Prevents automatic restart after a human interruption
	•	Is clear, modular, and ready for integration with alarms, HMIs, or extended logic like multi-stage wash cycles

**Focus on Safety:**

Ensure that the PLC logic prioritizes safety by stopping the wash process immediately when a human is detected in the wash area. This is critical to prevent accidents and ensure the integrity of the car wash system. The logic should also include a clear state machine to manage the transition between safe and unsafe conditions, ensuring that the system remains in a safe state until it is clear to proceed.

**Focus on Automation:**

The PLC logic should be designed to automate the car wash process, starting the wash cycle only when a car is present and no humans are detected. This should be achieved through the use of sensors and interlocks, ensuring that the wash process is only initiated when it is safe to do so. The logic should also include a clear state machine to manage the transition between safe and unsafe conditions, ensuring that the system remains in a safe state until it is clear to proceed.

**Focus on Interoperability:**

The PLC logic should be written in IEC 61131-3 Structured Text, ensuring that it is compatible with PLC programming standards and can be easily integrated with other control systems, such as HMI interfaces or safety interlocks. The logic should be modular and self-contained, with clear comments and documentation to facilitate integration and maintenance.

**Focus on Clarity:**

The PLC logic should be presented in a clear and concise manner, with a focus on modularity and self-documentation. The logic should be presented in a structured text format, with each step clearly defined and explained. The logic should also include comments and documentation to explain the interlock behavior, human override handling, and safe state restoration.

**Focus on Compliance:**

Ensure that the PLC logic is compliant with IEC 61131-3 standards, including the use of structured text for programming and the proper handling of safety interlocks. The logic should be designed to ensure that the car wash process is only initiated when it is safe to do so, and that the system remains in a safe state until it is clear to proceed. The logic should also include clear documentation and comments to facilitate compliance with safety standards and interoperability with other control systems.
