### Intent:
**Intent Summary:**  
Develop an IEC 61131-3 Structured Text PLC program to safely control an automatic car wash station, ensuring the wash process only runs when a car is present and no humans are detected, with immediate shutdown and alarm activation if a human enters the wash area.  

*(Focus: Safety prioritization, sensor monitoring, and process interruption logic.)*

### Prompt:
**Automatic Car Wash Station Control Using 61131-3 Structured Text:**

Write a PLC program in structured text (ST) according to IEC 61131-3 standards to control an automatic car wash station with a single wash bay. The system should use a sensor to detect the presence of a car. Once the car is detected and no human is present in the wash area, the system should initiate the car wash process. If a human is detected within the car wash area at any point, the station should immediately stop the wash process, trigger an alarm, and remain in a safe state until the area is clear.

**R-I-S-E:**

ðŸŸ¥ R (Role) â€“ Your Role

You are a PLC programmer tasked with developing a safe and efficient control system for an automatic car wash station using IEC 61131-3 Structured Text (ST). Your objective is to ensure the wash cycle operates only under safe conditions and immediately halts in case of human presence.

â¸»

ðŸŸ© I (Input) â€“ What Youâ€™re Given

You are provided with the following system components:
	â€¢	Sensors:
	â€¢	CarPresentSensor : BOOL â€” TRUE when a car is inside the wash bay
	â€¢	HumanDetectedSensor : BOOL â€” TRUE when a person is detected inside the bay
	â€¢	Outputs to control:
	â€¢	WashActive : BOOL â€” TRUE when the wash process is running
	â€¢	AlarmActive : BOOL â€” TRUE when a human is detected during wash operation
	â€¢	SafeToRun : BOOL â€” internal flag to lock/unlock wash permission based on safety state

â¸»

ðŸŸ§ S (Steps) â€“ What You Need to Do
	1.	Monitor the sensors each scan cycle:
	â€¢	Continuously check the presence of a car (CarPresentSensor)
	â€¢	Continuously check for human detection (HumanDetectedSensor)
	2.	Develop the control logic using structured text:
	â€¢	If a human is detected at any time, stop the wash (WashActive := FALSE), set the alarm (AlarmActive := TRUE), and disable further operation (SafeToRun := FALSE)
	â€¢	If a car is present, no human is detected, and SafeToRun = TRUE, allow the wash to start
	â€¢	Once the area is clear and the wash is inactive, reset SafeToRun to TRUE to enable a new cycle
	3.	Document each condition clearly with comments explaining:
	â€¢	The priority of human safety
	â€¢	Why the wash process must lock after a safety breach
	â€¢	How SafeToRun prevents immediate unsafe restarts

â¸»

ðŸŸ¦ E (Expectation) â€“ What Success Looks Like

You will have implemented a reliable and safe car wash controller that:
	â€¢	Starts washing only when a car is detected and no person is present
	â€¢	Instantly halts and alarms when a person enters during the cycle
	â€¢	Locks out the system until the area is verified clear and wash is idle
	â€¢	Can be easily integrated with HMI displays, safety relays, and alarm beacons
	â€¢	Follows structured and maintainable logic written according to IEC 61131-3 ST standards

// Logic
// Priority 1: Human safety
// If a human is detected at any time, stop the wash, set the alarm, and disable further operation
if HumanDetectedSensor then
	WashActive := FALSE;
	AlarmActive := TRUE;
	SafeToRun := FALSE;

// Priority 2: Wash process
// If a car is present, no human is detected, and SafeToRun = TRUE, allow the wash to start
if CarPresentSensor and not HumanDetectedSensor and SafeToRun then
	WashActive := TRUE;

// Human safety is the highest priority, so the wash process must lock after a safety breach

**Reflection:**

**What did you learn from this challenge?**

I learned the importance of prioritizing safety in PLC programming and the need to implement fail-safe measures to prevent accidents. I also learned how to use structured text to write maintainable and readable code that follows IEC 61131-3 standards.

**What was the most challenging part of this challenge?**

The most challenging part of this challenge was ensuring that the code was safe and reliable. I had to carefully consider the priority of each condition and make sure that the code was written in a way that would prevent any potential safety issues.

**What would you do differently if you were to do this challenge again?**

If I were to do this challenge again, I would spend more time testing and debugging the code to ensure that it was working as intended. I would also try to write more concise and clear comments to make the code easier to understand for other programmers.

**What are some real-world applications of this challenge?**

This challenge can be applied to a wide range of industries that
