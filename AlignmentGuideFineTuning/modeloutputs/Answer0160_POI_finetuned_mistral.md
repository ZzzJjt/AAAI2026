### Intent:
**Intent Summary:**  
Develop an ISA-88-compliant batch control system in structured text to automate polyethylene production, sequentially managing material dosing, polymerization, quenching, drying, pelletizing, quality checks, and packaging with modular function blocks for each unit operation.  

*(Focus: Batch process automation, sequential control, modularity, safety constraints, and quality assurance in polymer manufacturing.)*

### Prompt:
**Startup Steam Generator:**

Develop a non-linear model-predictive controller (NMPC) in Python to optimize the startup process of a steam generator in a power plant. The NMPC should be designed to handle the non-linear dynamics of the steam generation process, considering key variables such as pressure, temperature, and flow rates. The controller must minimize startup time while maintaining safety and operational constraints.

Ensure that the Python implementation is modular, with clear explanations of the optimization algorithm, control horizon, and prediction model. Discuss the benefits of using NMPC for steam generator startup, particularly in terms of energy efficiency and system stability, and highlight the challenges associated with controlling such a complex non-linear process.

**B-A-B:**

ðŸŸ¥ B (Before) â€“ The Problem or Challenge

Starting up a steam generator in a power plant is a complex task involving non-linear interactions between variables like temperature, pressure, and flow rate. Traditional linear controllers often struggle to handle these dynamics efficiently and safely during the startup phase. Without advanced control, the process may result in extended startup times, energy waste, and risks to equipment safety due to overshoots or unstable transients.

ðŸŸ© A (After) â€“ The Desired Outcome

Design and implement a non-linear model-predictive controller (NMPC) in Python to optimize the startup of a steam generator. The NMPC should:
	â€¢	Handle the systemâ€™s non-linear behavior
	â€¢	Minimize startup time while satisfying safety and operational constraints
	â€¢	Dynamically adjust control actions in response to pressure, temperature, and flow changes
	â€¢	Provide a modular Python codebase with explanations of the prediction model, control horizon, and optimization algorithm

Additionally, the implementation should emphasize the benefits of NMPC in terms of energy efficiency, robustness, and system stability, while also addressing the challenges of modeling and controlling a non-linear thermal system.

ðŸŸ§ B (Bridge) â€“ How to Get There
	1.	Build a non-linear dynamic model of the steam generator using differential equations or simulation data.
	2.	Design the NMPC framework with a prediction model, a finite control horizon, and an objective function that minimizes startup time while respecting constraints (e.g., max pressure, safe ramp rates).
	3.	Implement the NMPC in Python using a modular structure, e.g., with model.py, controller.py, and main.py.
	4.	Integrate safety bounds and soft/hard constraints on variables.
	5.	Validate the controller with simulation runs and visualize its performance compared to baseline strategies.
	6.	Document the algorithm, parameter tuning, and results in code comments and accompanying analysis.
