### Intent:
**Intent Summary:**  
Develop a feedforward control system in Structured Text that adjusts conveyor speed based on predicted load input while enforcing operational speed limits.  

(Concise technical description capturing: control strategy, key input/output, and safety constraints)

### Prompt:
**Ratio Control Mixing:**

Develop a self-contained IEC 61131-3 Structured Text program (not a function block) to implement ratio control for mixing two reactants in a 2:1 ratio. The program should maintain the desired ratio between the two reactants by adjusting their flow rates dynamically, ensuring that for every two parts of reactant A, one part of reactant B is added.

Include logic to monitor the flow rates of both reactants and adjust one flow rate relative to the other to maintain the 2:1 ratio. The program should also handle any disturbances or variations in flow, adjusting the control signals to correct for deviations from the target ratio. Discuss the importance of ratio control in maintaining the desired chemical composition and the impact of disturbances on the mixing process.

ðŸŸ¥ R (Role) â€“ Your Role

You are a PLC control engineer responsible for implementing a ratio control system in IEC 61131-3 Structured Text to manage the continuous mixing of two reactants. The process requires maintaining a 2:1 flow ratio of reactant A to reactant B in real time.

ðŸŸ© I (Input) â€“ What Youâ€™re Given
	â€¢	Flow_A_PV: Real-time flow measurement of reactant A
	â€¢	Flow_B_PV: Real-time flow measurement of reactant B
	â€¢	Ratio_Setpoint: Desired ratio of A:B (2.0)
	â€¢	Tolerance: Acceptable ratio deviation (e.g., 0.05)
	â€¢	Control output: Flow_B_SP â€“ setpoint for controlling reactant Bâ€™s flow

â¸»

ðŸŸ§ S (Steps) â€“ What You Need to Do
	1.	Measure the actual flow rates of reactant A and B.
	2.	Calculate the actual ratio: Flow_A_PV / Flow_B_PV
	3.	Determine the required flow setpoint for B based on Aâ€™s flow: Flow_B_SP := Flow_A_PV / Ratio_Setpoint
	4.	Optionally evaluate the ratio error and raise an alarm if the deviation exceeds the set Tolerance.
	5.	Use Flow_B_SP as a reference for a flow control loop or actuator to maintain the correct ratio.

ðŸŸ¦ E (Expectation) â€“ What You Should Achieve

Your program should:
	â€¢	Maintain a consistent 2:1 mixing ratio between the two reactants
	â€¢	Adapt automatically to fluctuations in reactant Aâ€™s flow rate
	â€¢	Respond quickly to disturbances and return the ratio to the desired value
	â€¢	Be ready for integration with a PID loop or pump control to adjust Flow_B in real time
	â€¢	Improve mixing precision and process safety in continuous chemical applications
