**Example Use Case:**
Imagine you are working on a chemical reactor where temperature control is critical. You have a PID function block configured with Kp = 1.5, Ki = 0.01, and Kd = 0.1. The setpoint (SP) is 75Â°C, and the process variable (PV) is measured by a temperature sensor. The block calculates the error, computes the proportional, integral, and derivative terms, and generates a control signal (OUT) to adjust the reactor's heating element. The output is limited to prevent over- or under-heating, and the system maintains the reactor's temperature within a tight tolerance around the setpoint.

**Note:** This explanation assumes a basic understanding of PID control theory and its application in industrial automation. For more detailed information, refer to the OSCAT library documentation or consult with a controls engineer or automation expert.

**Explanation of PID Function Block Parameters:**

1. **Setpoint (SP):** The desired value of the process variable that the PID controller aims to maintain. In the example, the setpoint is 75Â°C for the reactor's temperature.
2. **Process Variable (PV):** The actual value of the process variable being measured by a sensor. In the example, the PV is the temperature measured by the temperature sensor.
3. **Proportional Gain (Kp):** A constant that determines the proportional response of the controller. It multiplies the error (SP - PV) to generate a control signal. A higher Kp value results in a stronger proportional response, but may also lead to overshoot and oscillations.
4. **Integral Gain (Ki):** A constant that determines the integral response of the controller. It accumulates the error over time and generates a control signal to eliminate steady-state error. A higher Ki value results in faster error elimination, but may also lead to overshoot and oscillations.
5. **Derivative Gain (Kd):** A constant that determines the derivative response of the controller. It calculates the rate of change of the error and generates a control signal to reduce overshoot and improve stability. A higher Kd value results in faster response to changes in the process variable, but may also lead to increased noise and oscillations.
6. **MANUAL:** An optional mode flag that allows manual override of the PID controller. When set to TRUE, the controller's output is held constant, and the user can manually adjust the control signal.
