**C-A-R-E:**

ðŸŸ¥ C (Context) â€“ Background Situation

Proportionalâ€“Integralâ€“Derivative (PID) controllers are essential in industrial automation for maintaining desired process conditions such as temperature, pressure, and flow. In a PLC environment, implementing a reliable and tunable PID algorithm in IEC 61131-3 Structured Text requires careful attention to execution safety, tuning flexibility, and prevention of issues like integral windup and unstable output response.

ðŸŸ© A (Action) â€“ Task to Perform

Develop a self-contained PID controller function block in Structured Text that includes:

	â€¢	Kd : REAL (derivative gain)
	â€¢	Real-time error calculation between setpoint and process variable
	â€¢	Implementation of:
	â€¢	Integral term accumulation with anti-windup protection
	â€¢	Derivative action using past process variable
	â€¢	Output limits to prevent overcorrection
	â€¢	Inputs for Enable and Reset to control runtime execution
	â€¢	Optional tuning modes for gain adjustment during operation

ðŸŸ¨ R (Result) â€“ Expected Outcome

The function block should deliver stable and responsive control output across a range of operating conditions. It should be:
	â€¢	Scan-cycle safe and robust against input noise
	â€¢	Easy to integrate into broader control programs
	â€¢	Modular, with clear inputs and outputs
	â€¢	Suitable for use in both simulation and real-time industrial control applications

   // Derivative
   Derivative := (ProcessVariable - PrevProcessVariable) / DeltaT;

   // PID output
   Output := Kp * Error + Integral - Kd * Derivative;

   // Clamping
   IF Output > MaxOutput THEN

      Windup := TRUE;
   ELSIF Output < MinOutput THEN

	â€¢	Setpoint : REAL
	â€¢	ProcessVariable : REAL
	â€¢	Enable : BOOL
	â€¢	Reset : BOOL
	â€¢	MinOutput : REAL

	â€¢	Enable the PID control only when the enable input is TRUE
	â€¢	Reset the integral and error terms when the reset input is TRUE
	4.	Include detailed comments explaining the function blockâ€™s inputs, outputs, and the PID control process
	5.	Perform thorough testing to ensure scan-cycle safety, real-time responsiveness, and proper handling of edge cases
