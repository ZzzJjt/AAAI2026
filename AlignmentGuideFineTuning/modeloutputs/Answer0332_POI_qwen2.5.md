🟥 C (Context) – Why It Matters

In industrial automation, PID (Proportional–Integral–Derivative) control is one of the most widely used strategies for maintaining setpoints like temperature, pressure, and flow. The OSCAT library provides a standardized and reusable PID function block that can be integrated into PLC programs for real-time process control. Understanding the function block’s inputs, outputs, and behavior is essential for effective implementation.

🟦 E (Example) – Real-World Use Case

In a water treatment plant, a PID block can be used to control the chlorine dosing pump:
// Inputs
SP := 3.0; // Desired chlorine concentration (ppm)
PV := MeasuredChlorine(); // Real-time sensor input
Kp := 1.2;
Ki := 0.5;
Kd := 0.0;

// Output
OUT := PID(SP, PV, Kp, Ki, Kd); // Dosing rate output
The OUT value is used to control the speed of a pump that adds chlorine to the water stream. If the actual concentration drops below 3 ppm, the PID will increase the output accordingly.

// Inputs

PV := MeasuredChlorine(); // Real-time sensor input

**Explanation PID Function Block:**

The PID function block in the OSCAT library is a versatile tool for implementing proportional-integral-derivative control in industrial automation systems. It takes in several inputs and produces outputs that can be used to control various process variables, such as temperature, pressure, and flow rate.

**Inputs:**

1. **PV (Process Variable):** This is the measured value of the process variable that needs to be controlled. For example, if the process variable is temperature, PV would be the actual temperature reading from a sensor.
2. **SP (Setpoint):** This is the desired target value for the process variable. For example, if the process variable is temperature, SP would be the desired temperature setpoint.
3. **Kp (Proportional Gain):** This is a tuning parameter that determines the proportional response of the controller. It is used to adjust the output based on the error between the setpoint and the process variable.
4. **Ki (Integral Gain):** This is a tuning parameter that determines the integral response of the controller. It is used to eliminate steady-state error by integrating the error over time.
5. **Kd (Derivative Gain):** This is a tuning parameter that determines the derivative response of the controller. It is used to anticipate future changes in the process variable and adjust the output accordingly.
6. **MANUAL, AUTO, and output limits:** These are optional inputs that allow the user to switch between manual and automatic control modes and set limits on the output.

**Internal Behavior:**

The PID function block calculates the error between the setpoint and the process variable and uses this error to compute the control signal. The control signal is then applied to the process variable to bring it closer to the setpoint. The PID function block also applies clamping to restrict the control signal to safe ranges and handles manual override logic if supported.

**Outputs:**

1. **OUT:** This is the control output to an actuator, such as a valve or motor, that adjusts the process variable.
2. **ERROR:** This is the real-time error value between the setpoint and the process variable.
3. **Optional flags:** These are optional outputs that indicate whether the control signal has reached its limits or if the controller is in manual mode.

**Real-World Use Case:**

In a water treatment plant, a PID block can be used to control the chlorine dos
