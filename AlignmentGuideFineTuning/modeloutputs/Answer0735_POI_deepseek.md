**Implementation:**

```
FUNCTION_BLOCK MatrixMultiply4x4
VAR_INPUT
    MatrixA, MatrixB : ARRAY[1..4, 1..4] OF REAL;
END_VAR
VAR_OUTPUT
    MatrixC : ARRAY[1..4, 1..4] OF REAL;
END_VAR

END_VAR

FOR i := 1 TO 4 DO
    FOR j := 1 TO 4 DO

        FOR k := 1 TO 4 DO
            MatrixC[i,j] := MatrixC[i,j] + MatrixA[i,k] * MatrixB[k,j];
        END_FOR;
    END_FOR;
END_FOR;
```

**Analysis:**

This function block performs matrix multiplication of two 4x4 matrices, MatrixA and MatrixB. The computational complexity is O(nÂ³), which makes it inefficient for large matrices. In real-time applications, this function block may cause a significant delay due to the nested FOR loops.

The memory usage is also a concern, as the function block uses an array-based implementation. This means that the size of the input matrices must be fixed and pre-sized, which can limit the flexibility of the function block.

Despite these limitations, the function block can be useful in applications where matrix multiplication is required, such as coordinate frame transformations or chaining 3D transformation matrices in robotic arms. However, it is important to consider alternative methods or libraries that may offer better scalability and performance for larger matrices.
