### Intent:
**Intent Summary:**  
Create a reusable IEC 61131-3 function block in Structured Text to accurately convert a 10-digit decimal value to a hexadecimal string, handling edge cases (e.g., large values, overflows) for industrial diagnostics or communication.  

*(Focus: Decimal-to-hex conversion, robustness, and integration for PLCs/HMI systems.)*

### Prompt:
**DecToHex:**
Implement a self-contained function block in IEC 61131-3 structured text to convert a 10-digit decimal value to hexadecimal. Ensure proper handling of large values and edge cases.

**B-A-B:**

🟥 B (Before) – The Problem or Challenge

In industrial automation systems, there’s often a need to display or log numerical data in hexadecimal format, especially for diagnostics, memory addresses, or communication protocols. However, standard data type limitations and lack of built-in conversion tools in some PLCs make it challenging to safely convert large decimal values (up to 10 digits) into hex. Failing to handle edge cases—such as overflows or unsupported value ranges—can lead to runtime errors or incorrect results.

⸻

🟩 A (After) – The Desired Outcome

Develop a self-contained function block in IEC 61131-3 Structured Text that converts a 10-digit decimal value to its hexadecimal representation. The function block should:
	•	Accept a large decimal input (e.g., up to 9999999999)
	•	Perform accurate conversion to a hex string
	•	Handle edge cases, such as values at or beyond the upper limit of the platform’s numeric range
	•	Return the result as a STRING or ARRAY of characters for easy integration with HMI, logging, or communication logic

⸻

🟧 B (Bridge) – How to Get There
	1.	Define the function block interface with inputs like:
	•	DecValue : DINT or LINT (depending on platform)
	2.	Use internal logic to:
	•	Loop through the value using modulo and division by 16
	•	Convert numeric remainders (0–15) into corresponding ASCII hex characters ('0'..'F')
	•	Build the hex string in reverse, then output it correctly
	3.	Output:
	•	HexString : STRING or equivalent
	4.	Add input validation and comments to explain logic and platform-specific constraints.

**Example Usage:**
```plaintext
// Example usage in a PLC program
VAR
    DecValue : DINT := 1234567890; // Large decimal value
    HexString : STRING[10]; // Output string for hex representation
END_VAR

// Call the function block
DecToHex(DecValue, HexString);

// Now HexString contains the hex representation of DecValue
```

**Note:** This function block is designed for platforms that support DINT or LINT data types and have built-in string manipulation capabilities. Adjustments may be needed for specific PLC models or programming environments.
