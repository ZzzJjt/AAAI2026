### Intent:
**Intent Summary:**  
Create a reusable IEC 61131-3 function block in Structured Text to accurately convert a 10-digit decimal value to a hexadecimal string, handling edge cases (e.g., large values, overflows) for industrial diagnostics or communication.  

*(Focus: Decimal-to-hex conversion, robustness, and integration for PLCs/HMI systems.)*

### Prompt:
**DecToHex:**
Implement a self-contained function block in IEC 61131-3 structured text to convert a 10-digit decimal value to hexadecimal. Ensure proper handling of large values and edge cases.

**B-A-B:**

ðŸŸ¥ B (Before) â€“ The Problem or Challenge

In industrial automation systems, thereâ€™s often a need to display or log numerical data in hexadecimal format, especially for diagnostics, memory addresses, or communication protocols. However, standard data type limitations and lack of built-in conversion tools in some PLCs make it challenging to safely convert large decimal values (up to 10 digits) into hex. Failing to handle edge casesâ€”such as overflows or unsupported value rangesâ€”can lead to runtime errors or incorrect results.

ðŸŸ© A (After) â€“ The Desired Outcome

Develop a self-contained function block in IEC 61131-3 Structured Text that converts a 10-digit decimal value to its hexadecimal representation. The function block should:
	â€¢	Accept a large decimal input (e.g., up to 9999999999)
	â€¢	Perform accurate conversion to a hex string
	â€¢	Handle edge cases, such as values at or beyond the upper limit of the platformâ€™s numeric range
	â€¢	Return the result as a STRING or ARRAY of characters for easy integration with HMI, logging, or communication logic

â¸»

ðŸŸ§ B (Bridge) â€“ How to Get There
	1.	Define the function block interface with inputs like:
	â€¢	DecValue : DINT or LINT (depending on platform)
	2.	Use internal logic to:
	â€¢	Loop through the value using modulo and division by 16
	â€¢	Convert numeric remainders (0â€“15) into corresponding ASCII hex characters ('0'..'F')
	â€¢	Build the hex string in reverse, then output it correctly
	3.	Output:
	â€¢	HexString : STRING or equivalent
	4.	Add input validation and comments to explain logic and platform-specific constraints.

**Example Usage:**
```plaintext
// Example usage in a PLC program
VAR
    DecValue : DINT := 1234567890; // Large decimal value
    HexString : STRING[10]; // Output string for hex representation
END_VAR

// Call the function block
DecToHex(DecValue, HexString);

// Now HexString contains the hex representation of DecValue
```

**Note:** This function block is designed for platforms that support DINT or LINT data types and have built-in string manipulation capabilities. Adjustments may be needed for specific PLC models or programming environments.
