ðŸŸ© I (Input) â€“ What Youâ€™re Given

You are provided with:
	â€¢	A 100-element integer input array:
InputArray: ARRAY[1..100] OF INT
	â€¢	The requirement to compute:
	â€¢	The mean (arithmetic average)
	â€¢	The sample standard deviation
	â€¢	Constraints such as:
	â€¢	Limited processing power and memory on PLCs
	â€¢	The need for real-time execution within a control scan cycle
	â€¢	Potential for overflow or precision loss during integer summation and squared operations

â¸»

ðŸŸ§ S (Steps) â€“ What You Need to Do
	1.	Create a function block named MeanStdDevCalculator with appropriate inputs and outputs:
 VAR_INPUT
    InputArray : ARRAY[1..100] OF INT;
  END_VAR
  VAR_OUTPUT
    Mean : REAL;
    StdDev : REAL;
  END_VAR
  2.	Implement logic for the mean:
	â€¢	Accumulate the sum using a loop with a REAL accumulator to avoid overflow
	â€¢	Divide by 100.0 to obtain the mean
	3.	Implement logic for the standard deviation:
	â€¢	Loop again through the array
	â€¢	Subtract the mean from each element, square the result, and accumulate
	â€¢	Divide by 99.0 (N - 1) and apply the square root function to get the standard deviation
	4.	Use inline comments to explain each part of the process:
	â€¢	Why REAL is used for intermediate variables
	â€¢	Why the divisor is 99.0 (for sample standard deviation)
	â€¢	Error checking strategies (optional)
	5.	Optimize for real-time use:
	â€¢	Use fixed-size loops for deterministic timing
	â€¢	Avoid dynamic memory or recursive calls
	â€¢	Test on target PLC hardware to ensure execution fits within scan time

ðŸŸ¦ E (Expectation) â€“ What Success Looks Like

You deliver a fully operational, modular function block that:
	â€¢	Accurately calculates the mean and standard deviation of a 100-element integer array
	â€¢	Executes efficiently and predictably within a real-time PLC scan cycle
	â€¢	Is applicable to:
	â€¢	Process monitoring
	â€¢	Sensor signal diagnostics
	â€¢	Quality control and statistical alarms
	â€¢	Is reusable and maintainable, with well-commented logic and clear structure
