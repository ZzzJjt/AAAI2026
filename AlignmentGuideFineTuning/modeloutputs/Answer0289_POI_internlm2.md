### Intent:
**Intent Summary:**  
Develop a structured text program to control a coffee machine's automated process, managing valves and mixer operations through state transitions while ensuring emergency stop functionality and proper ingredient dispensing.

### Prompt:
**Pneumatic System Control Using 61131-3 Structured Text:**

Write a self-contained 61131-3 structured text program (not a function block) to control a pneumatic system with a control loop frequency of 100 ms. The system should regulate the flow of air to actuators based on input signals, maintaining a flow rate of 50 standard liters per minute. The system must also ensure that the pressure remains within the specified range of 5.5 to 6 bar. Implement safety checks to handle any deviations in flow or pressure and ensure efficient and reliable operation under varying load conditions.

**C-A-R-E:**

🟥 C (Context) – The Background

In pneumatic automation systems, precise flow and pressure control is essential to ensure reliable actuator performance and energy efficiency. Industrial applications often require real-time responsiveness, flow rate stability, and safety enforcement. Implementing this in a PLC with IEC 61131-3 Structured Text allows for scalable, deterministic control across varying load conditions.

🟩 A (Action) – The Implementation Task

Develop a self-contained Structured Text (ST) program that:
	•	Executes every 100 milliseconds (100 ms loop frequency)
	•	Regulates airflow to a setpoint of 50 standard liters per minute (SLPM)
	•	Monitors pressure to ensure it stays between 5.5 and 6.0 bar
	•	Includes safety mechanisms that:
	•	Detect and respond to over/under pressure
	•	Handle abnormal flow deviations
	•	Activates relevant outputs such as:
	•	A flow valve actuator
	•	A pressure relief valve
	•	Error flags for fault diagnostics

⸻

🟨 R (Result) – The Expected Outcome

The resulting program will:
	•	Maintain stable flow to meet actuator requirements
	•	Ensure operational safety by preventing pressure-related faults
	•	Trigger alerts or shutoffs when unsafe conditions are detected
	•	Operate reliably across varying loads and environmental conditions
	•	Be suitable for integration into larger industrial automation systems

    PressureInput : REAL;           // Pressure in bar
    FlowSetpoint : REAL := 50.0;    // Target flow rate
    MinPressure : REAL := 5.5;
    MaxPressure : REAL := 6.0;

    FlowValveOutput : BOOL := FALSE;
    PressureReliefValve : BOOL := FALSE;
    FlowError : BOOL := FALSE;
    PressureError : BOOL := FALSE;
END_VAR

// Flow Control Logic
IF FlowInput < FlowSetpoint THEN
    FlowValveOutput := TRUE;  // Open valve to increase flow
ELSIF FlowInput >= FlowSetpoint THEN

    PressureError := TRUE;
    PressureReliefValve := TRUE;  // Activate safety
ELSE
    PressureError := FALSE;
    PressureReliefValve := FALSE;

🟪 E (Example) – Execution Flow

1. The program starts and initializes variables.
2. The main loop begins, reading the current flow and pressure inputs.
3. The program processes the inputs, potentially adjusting the flow and pressure based on the setpoints and error conditions.
4. The program writes the outputs to the actuators, controlling the flow and pressure.
5. The program waits for the next loop iteration, repeating the process every 100 ms.

🟩 R (Result) – The Final Thoughts

By implementing this Structured Text program, you will have a reliable and efficient pneumatic system control that maintains flow and pressure within specified limits. The program's safety checks and output actions ensure that the system operates within safe parameters, even under varying load conditions. This program can be integrated into larger automation systems, providing a robust and scalable solution for pneumatic control.
