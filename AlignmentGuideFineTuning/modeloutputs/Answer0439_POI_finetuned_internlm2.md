### Intent:
**Intent Summary:**  
Develop a Structured Text function block to read and process diagnostic data from a Profibus DP slave device, including status, error codes, and communication health, with robust error handling and real-time monitoring capabilities.  

**Bridge to After Example:**  
Similarly, the provided EtherCAT state machine function block manages device state transitions with validation and error handling, demonstrating a parallel intent for structured control logic with diagnostic feedback.  

*(Note: The "After" example shows a different but related control taskâ€”state machine managementâ€”which shares the core principles of structured control logic with status monitoring and error handling.)*

### Prompt:
**Profibus DP Diagnostics Using 61131-3 Structured Text:**

Develop a self-contained 61131-3 structured text function block to read diagnostic data from a Profibus DP slave device. The function block should handle communication with the Profibus DP slave and retrieve diagnostic information such as device status, error codes, and communication health. Provide an explanation of the key steps in processing the diagnostic data, including request initiation, data retrieval, and error handling mechanisms.

**R-I-S-E:**

ðŸŸ¥ R (Role) â€“ Your Role

Act as a PLC programmer developing diagnostic and communication monitoring tools for Profibus DP networks using IEC 61131-3 Structured Text.

â¸»

ðŸŸ© I (Input) â€“ What Youâ€™re Given

You are tasked with creating a self-contained Structured Text (ST) function block that reads diagnostic data from a Profibus DP slave device. The function block must retrieve key information such as device status, error codes, and communication health, and expose execution status and error flags for use in control applications.

â¸»

ðŸŸ§ S (Steps) â€“ What You Need to Do
	1.	Define a function block interface with the following:
	â€¢	Inputs: Execute (BOOL), SlaveAddress (BYTE), Timeout (TIME)
	â€¢	Outputs: Done (BOOL), Busy (BOOL), Error (BOOL), ErrorID (DWORD), plus structured diagnostic outputs (e.g. DeviceStatus, CommState)
	2.	Inside the function block:
	â€¢	Detect rising edge of Execute to start the diagnostic read
	â€¢	Send a Profibus DP diagnostic request using the slave address
	â€¢	Wait for response and validate it within the given Timeout
	â€¢	Parse the response to extract error flags, status codes, and communication health indicators
	â€¢	Set output flags (Done, Error) and assign the parsed data to output variables
	3.	Implement internal error handling for timeouts, invalid responses, or communication loss. Provide ErrorID codes for troubleshooting.

â¸»

ðŸŸ¦ E (Expectation) â€“ What Success Looks Like

The function block allows the PLC program to retrieve and react to real-time diagnostic data from any Profibus DP slave. Operators and maintenance systems gain early visibility into device issues, while control logic can trigger alarms or fallback procedures based on accurate status and error conditionsâ€”improving system uptime and maintainability.

Operators and maintenance systems gain early visibility into device issues, while control logic can trigger alarms or fallback procedures based on accurate status and error conditionsâ€”improving system uptime and maintainability. The self-contained nature of the function block ensures that diagnostic data is always available and consistent, even in complex control systems.

**AFTER:**

Develop a self-contained 61131-3 structured text function block to manage device state transitions in an EtherCAT network. The function block should handle state changes, validate transitions, and provide error handling for invalid or unexpected state changes. The function block should include inputs for the current state, the desired state, and a timeout for state transitions. The outputs should include the new state, an error flag, and a message indicating the reason for the state change. The function block should be designed to be reusable in different control applications, ensuring consistent state management and error handling across the network.

	â€¢	Validate the current and desired states, ensuring they are within the defined range.
	â€¢	Check if the desired state is a valid transition from the current state within the defined timeout.
	â€¢	If the transition is valid, set the NewState output to the desired state and return True.
	â€¢	If the transition is invalid or timed out, set the Error output to True and provide a Reason message indicating the issue.
	â€¢	Implement error handling for invalid inputs
