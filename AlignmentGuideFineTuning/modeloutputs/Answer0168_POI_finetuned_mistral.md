### Intent:
**Intent Summary:**  
Create a scan-cycle-safe, iterative quicksort function block in IEC 61131-3 Structured Text to efficiently sort integer arrays on PLCs without recursion, using stack emulation and in-place partitioning.  

*(Focus: Industrial automation, memory safety, and iterative adaptation of quicksort for PLC constraints.)*

### Prompt:
**Quicksort:**
Implement a self-contained function block in IEC 61131-3 structured text to perform the quicksort algorithm on an array of integers. Ensure efficient partitioning and recursion handling.

**B-A-B:**

ðŸŸ¥ B (Before) â€“ The Problem or Challenge

In industrial automation tasks such as data sorting, ranking, or prioritizing process values, efficient sorting algorithms are essential. Quicksort is a powerful algorithm known for its average-case efficiency, but it typically relies on recursion, which is either not supported or discouraged in IEC 61131-3 Structured Text environments due to scan-cycle safety and memory limitations. Without a properly adapted approach, implementing quicksort on a PLC could result in stack overflows or unreadable code structures.

ðŸŸ© A (After) â€“ The Desired Outcome

Develop a self-contained function block in IEC 61131-3 Structured Text that performs the quicksort algorithm on an array of integers. The solution must:
	â€¢	Avoid direct recursion by simulating it with iterative control structures and stack emulation using arrays or state machines
	â€¢	Implement an efficient partitioning mechanism
	â€¢	Sort the array in place, preserving memory efficiency
	â€¢	Be modular, reusable, and compliant with scan-cycle-safe programming practices

â¸»

ðŸŸ§ B (Bridge) â€“ How to Get There
	1.	Define inputs for the function block such as:
	â€¢	InputArray : ARRAY[1..N] OF INT
	â€¢	Execute : BOOL
	2.	Create internal variables to manage sorting state:
	â€¢	Stack emulation using index arrays for Low and High
	â€¢	Pivot, i, j, and temporary variables for swaps
	3.	Use a loop-based simulation of recursive quicksort, pushing and popping subranges to/from an internal stack
	4.	Include an InProgress flag and a Done output to manage multi-scan execution if needed
	5.	Comment clearly on each phase: partitioning, swapping, and range management
