### Intent:
**Intent Summary:**  
Develop an MPC controller in MATLAB to regulate a distillation column's temperature and composition by adjusting feed rate while respecting operational constraints.  

(Key elements: MPC control, distillation column, temperature/composition regulation, feed rate manipulation, constraint handling)

### Prompt:
**Fuzzy Logic Control for Chemical Reactor Optimization Using Python:**

Develop Python code to implement a fuzzy logic control system for optimizing the operation of a chemical reactor. The control system should manage key reactor variables such as temperature, pressure, and reaction rate, considering the nonlinear and uncertain nature of the reactorâ€™s dynamics. Fuzzy logic should be applied to handle imprecise inputs and adjust control actions in real-time to maintain optimal reactor performance under varying operating conditions.

Implement Python code to simulate the chemical reactorâ€™s dynamics, demonstrating how fuzzy logic control can provide robust and adaptive responses to system uncertainties and process variations.

**R-I-S-E:**

ðŸŸ¥ Rï¼ˆRoleï¼‰

Act as a control systems engineer specializing in intelligent control algorithms for chemical processes.

ðŸŸ© Iï¼ˆInputï¼‰

You are provided with a description of a chemical reactor system that exhibits nonlinear and uncertain behavior. The system requires the regulation of key variables such as temperature, pressure, and reaction rate under dynamically changing conditions. You also have access to representative process data for simulation.

ðŸŸ§ Sï¼ˆStepsï¼‰
	1.	Design fuzzy logic rules and membership functions for the three main variables: temperature, pressure, and reaction rate.
	2.	Implement a fuzzy inference system in Python to manage the control of the reactor.
	3.	Simulate the chemical reactorâ€™s dynamics under various operating scenarios and disturbances.
	4.	Compare the fuzzy logic controllerâ€™s adaptability and robustness with that of a traditional PID controller in handling uncertainties and process variations.

ðŸŸ¦ Eï¼ˆExpectationï¼‰

Demonstrate that the fuzzy logic control system maintains stable and efficient reactor operation under uncertain and nonlinear conditions, showing greater resilience and adaptability compared to traditional control strategies.
