The PID function block in the OSCAT library is a crucial component for implementing Proportional-Integral-Derivative (PID) control, a widely used method for process control in industrial applications. This block takes in several inputs and produces outputs that help maintain the desired process variable (PV) at the setpoint (SP) by adjusting the control signal (OUT).

**Inputs:**

1. **Setpoint (SP):** This is the desired target value of the process variable. For example, if you're controlling the temperature of a reactor, the SP might be set to 75Â°C.
2. **Process Variable (PV):** This is the actual measured value of the process variable. In the case of temperature control, PV would be the current temperature reading.
3. **Tuning Constants:**
	* **Kp (Proportional Gain):** This constant determines the strength of the proportional term, which directly affects the control signal based on the error between SP and PV.
	* **Ki (Integral Gain):** This constant determines the strength of the integral term, which helps eliminate steady-state errors by integrating the error over time.
	* **Kd (Derivative Gain):** This constant determines the strength of the derivative term, which helps dampen sudden changes in the process variable by considering the rate of change of the error.
4. **Optional Inputs:**
	* **MANUAL Mode:** This input allows the user to override automatic control and manually adjust the control signal.
	* **LIMIT_HI and LIMIT_LO:** These inputs allow the user to set upper and lower limits for the control signal, ensuring that it doesn't exceed safe operating ranges.

**Processing:**

The PID function block computes the error between the setpoint and the process variable, then calculates the proportional, integral, and derivative terms based on the tuning constants. These terms are combined to form the control signal, which is then outputted to the actuator (e.g., valve position, motor speed). The block also includes output limiting and anti-windup protection to prevent the control signal from becoming too large or oscillating.

**Outputs:**

1. **Control Signal (OUT):** This is the output signal sent to the actuator, which adjusts the process variable to bring it closer to the setpoint.
2. **Error:** This is the real-time deviation between the setpoint and the process variable.
3. **Status Flags:** These flags indicate whether the control signal has reached its limits or
