**MatrixMultiply4x4 Function Block:**

```structuredtext
FUNCTION_BLOCK MatrixMultiply4x4
VAR_INPUT
    MatrixA, MatrixB : ARRAY[1..4, 1..4] OF REAL;
END_VAR
VAR_OUTPUT
    MatrixC : ARRAY[1..4, 1..4] OF REAL;
END_VAR

// Initialize the result matrix with zeros
FOR i := 1 TO 4 DO
    FOR j := 1 TO 4 DO
        MatrixC[i,j] := 0;
    END_FOR;
END_FOR;

// Perform matrix multiplication
FOR i := 1 TO 4 DO
    FOR j := 1 TO 4 DO
        FOR k := 1 TO 4 DO
            // Accumulate the product of elements from MatrixA and MatrixB
            MatrixC[i,j] := MatrixC[i,j] + MatrixA[i,k] * MatrixB[k,j];
        END_FOR;
    END_FOR;
END_FOR;

END_FUNCTION_BLOCK
```

**Performance Analysis:**

The computational complexity of the provided function block is O(nÂ³), where n is the size of the matrices (in this case, 4). This complexity arises from the three nested loops required to compute the product of two matrices. While this complexity is manageable for 4x4 matrices, it can become a bottleneck for larger matrices due to the cubic growth in computation time.

**Scalability Considerations:**

For larger matrices, the function block may need to be adapted to handle memory constraints and potential scan-time issues in PLC environments. Some strategies include:
- **Memory Management:** Ensure that the function block does not exceed the available memory by checking the size of the matrices before performing the multiplication.
- **Iteration Limits:** Implement checks to prevent infinite loops or excessive iterations, especially if the matrices are dynamically sized.
- **Segmentation:** For very large matrices, consider segmenting the computation into smaller chunks that can be processed within the PLC's scan time.

**Conclusion:**

The `MatrixMultiply4x4` function block is a reusable and efficient implementation for multiplying two 4x4 matrices in IEC 61131-3 Structured Text. It is well-suited for real-time control tasks such as robotics and transformations. However, for larger matrices, additional considerations and optimizations may be necessary to ensure performance and scalability within PLC environments.
