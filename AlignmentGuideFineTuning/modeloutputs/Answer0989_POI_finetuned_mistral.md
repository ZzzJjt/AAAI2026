### Control Narrative for LNG Vaporizer System

#### 1. Purpose
The control narrative for the LNG Vaporizer System is designed to ensure safe and efficient operation of the LNG vaporization process by specifying the control logic, setpoints, and interlocks for each stage of the process. This document serves as a critical reference for operators, engineers, and automation teams to ensure consistent and compliant operation of the LNG vaporizer.

#### 2. Process Overview
The LNG Vaporizer System receives LNG from the storage tank and converts it into gas for downstream use. The process involves the following stages:
- **LNG Inlet**: The LNG is fed into the vaporizer through a pressure-regulated inlet.
- **Heating Section**: The LNG passes through a series of heat exchangers, where it is heated to its boiling point (âˆ’162Â°C) to convert it into gas.
- **Gas Outlet**: The resulting gas is sent to the downstream gas distribution system.

#### 3. Control Loops and Setpoints

##### 3.1 LNG Inlet Pressure Control
- **Control Loop**: LNG Inlet Pressure (PIC101) â†’ Pressure Control Valve (PCV101)
- **Setpoint**: 4.5 bar
- **Control Range**: 4.2 to 4.8 bar
- **Alarm Limits**:
  - **High Alarm**: 5.0 bar
  - **Low Alarm**: 4.0 bar

##### 3.2 Heating Section Temperature Control
- **Control Loop**: Temperature Transmitter (TT101) â†’ Temperature Controller (TIC101) â†’ Heating Valve (TCV101)
- **Setpoint**: âˆ’162Â°C
- **Control Range**: âˆ’162 Â± 2Â°C
- **Alarm Limits**:
  - **High Alarm**: âˆ’160Â°C
  - **Low Alarm**: âˆ’164Â°C

##### 3.3 Gas Flow Control
- **Control Loop**: Gas Flow Transmitter (FT101) â†’ Flow Controller (FIC1
