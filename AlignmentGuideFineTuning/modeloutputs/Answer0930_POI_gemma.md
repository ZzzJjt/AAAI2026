### Intent:
**Intent Summary:**  
Convert a traffic light control program written in Structured Text (ST) to Instruction List (IL), preserving its finite state machine logic, timer-based phase transitions, and emergency/pedestrian override functionality for PLC deployment.

### Prompt:
**Translate ST To Instruction List:**

Translate the following 61131-3 Structured Text program to 61131-3 Instruction List: PROGRAM PickAndPlace VAR ManualButton : BOOL; // Input signal for manual mode AutoButton : BOOL; // Input signal for auto mode ClipButton : BOOL; // Input signal for clip action TransferButton : BOOL; // Input signal for transfer action ReleaseButton : BOOL; // Input signal for release action ConveyorA : BOOL; // Input signal for presence of product on conveyor A ConveyorB : BOOL; // Output signal to control conveyor B RoboticArm : BOOL; // Output signal to control the robotic arm Mode : INT := 0; // Internal variable to store the current mode (0 = manual, 1 = auto) AutoProcess : BOOL := FALSE; // Internal variable to store whether the auto control process is currently running END_VAR

// Manual mode control process IF ManualButton THEN Mode := 0; // Set mode to manual END_IF

IF Mode = 0 THEN // Manual mode IF ClipButton AND ConveyorA THEN RoboticArm := TRUE; // Clip the product ELSIF TransferButton THEN ConveyorB := TRUE; // Transfer the product to conveyor B ELSIF ReleaseButton THEN ConveyorB := FALSE; // Release the product from conveyor B END_IF END_IF

// Auto mode control process IF AutoButton THEN Mode := 1; // Set mode to auto END_IF

IF Mode = 1 THEN // Auto mode IF NOT AutoProcess AND ConveyorA THEN // Only start the process if not currently running and there is a product on conveyor A AutoProcess := TRUE; // Set flag to indicate that the auto process is running RoboticArm := TRUE; // Clip the product WAIT 2; // Wait for 2 seconds to transfer the product ConveyorB := TRUE; // Transfer the product to conveyor B END_IF IF ConveyorB AND NOT ConveyorA THEN // Release the product from conveyor B once it has been transferred and there is no product on conveyor A ConveyorB := FALSE; AutoProcess := FALSE; // Clear the flag to indicate that the auto process is not running END_IF END_IF

**T-A-G:**

üü• T (Task)

Translate a Structured Text (ST) program written in IEC 61131-3 into its equivalent Instruction List (IL) representation.

üü© A (Action)

Take the provided PickAndPlace ST program, which includes variable declarations, mode selection, conditional logic for manual and automatic control, and a process delay (WAIT). Convert the logic into Instruction List using IL syntax such as LD, ST, AND, JMPC, JMP, and labels. Accurately simulate timing behavior and preserve all logical conditions, ensuring operational equivalence between the two formats.

üü¶ G (Goal)

Deliver a complete and syntactically correct IL version of the program that maintains the same functional behavior as the original ST code‚Äîready to be used on IL-compatible PLCs for industrial automation tasks.

üü¶ G (Goal)

Deliver a complete and syntactically correct IL version of the program that maintains the same functional behavior as the original ST code‚Äîready to be used on IL-compatible PLCs for industrial automation tasks.

**Context:**

The PickAndPlace program is a simple example of a PLC-based automation system that controls the movement of a robotic arm and conveyor belts to pick up and place objects. The program is written in Structured Text (ST), a high-level programming language that is commonly used in industrial automation.

The program has two modes of operation: manual and automatic. In manual mode, the operator can manually control the robotic arm and conveyor belts using buttons. In automatic mode, the program automatically controls the movement of the robotic arm and conveyor belts based on the presence of objects on the conveyor belts.

The program includes variable declarations for the input and output signals, as well as internal variables to store the current mode and the status of the automatic process. The conditional logic for manual and automatic control is implemented using IF-THEN-ELSE statements, and the process delay is implemented using the WAIT statement.

The program is designed to be used on a PLC that supports the IEC 61131-3 standard, which includes both ST and IL as programming languages. The goal of the translation is to ensure that the program can be used on a PLC that only supports IL, while maintaining the same functional behavior as the original ST code.

**Success Criteria:**

‚úÖ The translated IL program is syntactically correct and can be compiled and executed on an IL-compatible PLC.

‚úÖ The translated IL program maintains the same functional behavior as the original ST code, including the mode selection, conditional logic for manual and automatic control, and the process delay.

‚úÖ The translated IL program accurately simulates the timing behavior of the original ST code, including the WAIT statement.

‚úÖ The translated IL program preserves all logical conditions, including the AND and OR operators, and the JMP and JMPC statements.

‚úÖ The translated IL program is delivered in a format that can be easily imported into an IL-compatible PLC for use in industrial automation tasks.

**Failure Criteria:**

‚ùå The translated IL program is syntactically incorrect and cannot be compiled or executed on an IL-compatible PLC.

‚ùå The translated IL program does not maintain the same functional behavior as the original ST code, including the mode selection, conditional logic for manual and automatic control, and the process delay.

‚ùå The translated IL program does not accurately simulate the timing behavior of the original ST code, including the WAIT statement.

‚ùå The translated IL program does not preserve all logical conditions, including the AND and OR operators, and the JMP and JMPC statements.
