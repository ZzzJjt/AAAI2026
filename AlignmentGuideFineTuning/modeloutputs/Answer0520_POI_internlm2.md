ðŸŸ¥ R (Role) â€“ Your Role

ðŸŸ© I (Input) â€“ What Youâ€™re Given

You are required to develop a function block that:
	â€¢	Takes as inputs:
	â€¢	X : ARRAY[1..N] OF REAL â€” known x-values
	â€¢	Y : ARRAY[1..N] OF REAL â€” known corresponding y-values
	â€¢	TargetX : REAL â€” the x-value at which to evaluate the interpolated y
	â€¢	Produces as output:
	â€¢	InterpolatedY : REAL â€” the spline-interpolated y-value at TargetX

You must also consider:
	â€¢	Ensuring smoothness and continuity of the interpolation
	â€¢	Optimizing the algorithm for limited memory and processing time on a PLC
	â€¢	Providing clear documentation and reusable structure

ðŸŸ§ S (Steps) â€“ What You Need to Do
	1.	Create a function block named SplineInterpolator with appropriate input/output declarations.
	2.	Design the logic to:
	â€¢	Identify the interval [X[i], X[i+1]] that contains TargetX
	â€¢	Use precomputed cubic spline coefficients (a, b, c, d) for that segment
	â€¢	Evaluate the spline using the formula:
y = a + b(x - x_i) + c(x - x_i)^2 + d(x - x_i)^3
	3.	Comment the code to explain:
	â€¢	How spline coefficients are structured
	â€¢	How the interval is selected at runtime
	â€¢	How the evaluation is performed efficiently within one scan cycle
	4.	Handle edge cases:
	â€¢	Clamp TargetX if itâ€™s out of bounds
	â€¢	Warn about insufficient data points (fewer than 3)
	â€¢	Flag potential memory/performance limitations for large datasets

â¸»

ðŸŸ¦ E (Expectation) â€“ What Success Looks Like

You deliver a real-time capable, reusable function block that:
	â€¢	Computes smooth, continuous interpolated values over a set of known points
	â€¢	Minimizes runtime computation by separating initialization and evaluation phases
	â€¢	Improves curve fidelity in applications such as:
	â€¢	Motion trajectory generation
	â€¢	Signal smoothing
	â€¢	Profile-based control (e.g., temperature, pressure, flow)

The solution enables high-quality interpolation directly within the PLC, without relying on external devices or approximation hacks.

**Spline Interpolation:**

Spline interpolation is a powerful tool for generating smooth, continuous curves that pass through a set of known data points. Unlike linear interpolation, which simply connects the points with straight lines, spline interpolation uses a series of cubic polynomials to create a smooth curve that closely fits the data.

The key advantage of spline interpolation is its ability to generate curves that are not only smooth but also continuous. This is particularly important in applications where precise control over motion or other physical processes is required, such as in robotics, automation, or control systems.

In addition to its smoothness and continuity, spline interpolation also has several other benefits:
- It can handle a wide range of data points, including those with irregular spacing or non-uniform intervals.
- It can be easily extended to higher-order polynomials, such as quintic or higher-order splines, for even greater flexibility and accuracy.
- It can be used to generate curves that are not only smooth but also monotonic, meaning they have a consistent slope or rate of change.

Overall, spline interpolation is a powerful and versatile tool for generating smooth, continuous curves that can be used in a wide range of industrial automation applications. By implementing a real-time capable, reusable function block in IEC 61131-3 Structured Text, you can ensure that your control systems are able to generate high-quality interpolated values directly within the PLC, without relying on external devices or approximation hacks. This will help to improve the accuracy and precision of your control systems, and enable you to achieve better performance and more reliable results.
