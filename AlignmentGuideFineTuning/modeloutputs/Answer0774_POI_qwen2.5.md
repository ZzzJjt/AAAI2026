### Intent:
The task is to develop an ISA-88-compliant batch control program in IEC 61131-3 Structured Text for producing 100 kg of cocoa milk, including ingredient dosing, mixing at 200 RPM, heating to 70Â°C, and phase-based process control with fault handling.

### Prompt:
**Batch Cocoa Milk:**

Create an ISA-88 batch control recipe for producing 100 kg of cocoa milk, detailing the required ingredients, including milk, water, liquid sugar, and cocoa. The equipment should consist of a mixing and blending vessel capable of stirring and heating. Specify appropriate amounts for each ingredient, as well as optimal mixing temperatures and heating times.

Write a self-contained program in IEC 61131-3 Structured Text for the sequential control of the mixing process, incorporating typical parameter values such as stirring speed, temperature control, and time duration. Ensure the program follows ISA-88 principles, with clear logic for controlling the heating and blending phases. Discuss the challenges in scaling and optimizing the control process for industrial production.

**R-T-F:**

ðŸŸ¥ R (Role) â€“ Define Your Role

Act as a control systems engineer developing ISA-88-compliant batch processing programs using IEC 61131-3 Structured Text for food manufacturing systems.

ðŸŸ© T (Task) â€“ Define the Objective

Create an ISA-88-compliant batch control recipe to produce 100 kg of cocoa milk. The ingredients include milk, water, liquid sugar, and cocoa, processed in a mixing and blending vessel with heating and stirring capabilities. Then, implement a self-contained Structured Text program to control the sequential mixing and heating process, including:
	â€¢	Specific ingredient quantities
	â€¢	Stirring speed (e.g., 200 RPM)
	â€¢	Heating temperature (e.g., 70Â°C)
	â€¢	Time durations (e.g., 10 minutes blending)

The program must include logic for transitioning between ingredient addition, heating, and blending phases, and it should follow ISA-88 principles for modularity and phase separation.

ðŸŸ§ F (Format) â€“ Specify the Output Format

Provide a complete IEC 61131-3 Structured Text code block that includes:
	â€¢	Parameterized function or method calls for each operation (AddIngredient, StartHeating, StartMixing)
	â€¢	Use of timers, setpoints, and interlocks
	â€¢	Clear phase-based logic with comments and modular structure
	â€¢	Optional discussion on how the logic supports process scalability and reuse

**Example Code:**

```plaintext
PROGRAM BatchCocoaMilk
VAR
    milk : REAL := 50.0; // kg
    water : REAL := 25.0; // kg
    sugar : REAL := 10.0; // kg
    cocoa : REAL := 5.0; // kg
    stirringSpeed : REAL := 200.0; // RPM
    heatingTemperature : REAL := 70.0; // Â°C
    blendingTime : REAL := 10.0; // minutes
    heatingTime : REAL := 15.0; // minutes
    timer : TIME := 0.0;
    phase : INTEGER := 1; // 1 - AddIngredients, 2 - Heating, 3 - Blending
END_VAR

// AddIngredients Phase
IF phase = 1 THEN
    // Add milk, water, sugar, and cocoa
    // ...
    phase := 2;
END_IF;

// Heating Phase
IF phase = 2 THEN
    // Start heating to 70Â°C
    // ...
    timer := 0.0;
    phase := 3;
END_IF;

// Blending Phase
IF phase = 3 THEN
    // Start mixing at 200 RPM
    // ...
    timer := 0.0;
    phase := 4;
END_IF;

// Check if blending is complete
IF timer >= blendingTime THEN
    // Transition to next phase
    phase := 5;
END_IF;

// Check if heating is complete
IF timer >= heatingTime THEN
    // Transition to next phase
    phase := 4;
END_IF;

// Implement fault handling and interlocks as needed
```

This code provides a basic structure for the batch control program, with placeholders for the actual implementation of each phase. The program uses a timer to track the duration of each phase and transitions between phases based on the timer and phase variables. Fault handling and interlocks are not included in this example but should be considered in a complete implementation.
