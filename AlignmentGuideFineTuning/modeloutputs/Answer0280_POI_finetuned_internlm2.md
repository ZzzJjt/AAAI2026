### Intent:
**Intent Summary:**  
Create a reusable IEC 61131-3 Structured Text function block (`SplineInterpolator`) that performs cubic spline interpolation for smooth curve fitting between 10 predefined data points, with input validation, error handling, and diagnostic logging, optimized for PLC execution in industrial control applications like motion profiling.

### Prompt:
**Spline Interpolation:**

Develop a self-contained function block in IEC 61131-3 Structured Text to compute spline interpolation over a set of data points. Ensure that the function block is modular and efficient, with comments explaining the steps involved in constructing and evaluating the spline. Address potential computational challenges, such as memory usage and processing time, and discuss the advantages of spline interpolation in comparison to linear methods, particularly in applications where smooth curve fitting is essential.

**C-A-R-E:**

🟥 C (Context) – The Background

In industrial control applications, accurately interpolating between discrete data points is essential for smooth control, sensor calibration, and trajectory planning. While linear interpolation is simple and fast, it often produces sharp transitions and lacks smoothness. Spline interpolation, particularly cubic splines, offers a more refined curve fitting method by ensuring continuity in both the value and its derivatives. However, implementing spline interpolation on IEC 61131-3 Structured Text PLCs presents challenges due to memory constraints, processing time, and lack of built-in support.

🟩 A (Action) – The Implementation Task

Create a self-contained and modular function block in IEC 61131-3 Structured Text, named SplineInterpolator, that:
	•	Inputs:
	•	X : ARRAY[1..N] OF REAL — known x-values
	•	Y : ARRAY[1..N] OF REAL — corresponding y-values
	•	TargetX : REAL — the x-value at which to interpolate
	•	Output:
	•	InterpolatedY : REAL — the interpolated y-value using cubic spline logic

The function block should:
	•	Precompute spline coefficients (a, b, c, d) for each segment (e.g., during initialization or external preprocessing)
	•	Evaluate the appropriate cubic polynomial at runtime based on TargetX
	•	Include detailed inline comments explaining:
	•	The spline calculation steps
	•	How intervals are selected
	•	How memory and performance are managed

⸻

🟨 R (Result) – The Expected Outcome

The function block should:
	•	Accurately compute a smooth interpolated value across a set of predefined points
	•	Avoid the abrupt changes seen in linear interpolation, making it ideal for:
	•	Motion control trajectories
	•	Smooth signal transitions
	•	Process profile reconstruction
	•	Operate efficiently in a PLC scan cycle, balancing computation and memory use
	•	Be reusable and configurable for different datasets, promoting flexibility

🟦 E (Example) – A Practical Use Case

Suppose you’re controlling a robotic actuator that follows a predefined position profile with 10 control points. Using SplineInterpolator, you input the time stamps (X) and desired positions (Y). At each cycle, you provide the current time (TargetX), and the block returns the desired smooth interpolated position (InterpolatedY):

// Inputs
X := [0, 1, 2, ..., 9];
Y := [0.0, 1.2, 2.0, ..., 4.5];
TargetX := 3.5;

// Output
InterpolatedY := SplineInterpolator(X, Y, TargetX);
