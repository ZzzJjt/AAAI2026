### Prompt:
**PID Flow Control Water Treatment:**

Develop a self-contained IEC 61131-3 Structured Text program to implement PID feedback control for chemical dosing in a water treatment process. The program should regulate the dosing rate of chlorine at 3 ppm, adjusting based on real-time flow measurements with a sampling rate of 100 ms.

ðŸŸ¥ C (Context) â€“ The Background

In water treatment systems, precise control of chemical dosingâ€”particularly chlorineâ€”is essential to ensure public safety, compliance with health standards, and efficient operation. Variations in water flow can cause overdosing (wasting chemicals, harming infrastructure) or underdosing (failing to disinfect). A real-time PID control strategy helps maintain optimal chlorine levels.
