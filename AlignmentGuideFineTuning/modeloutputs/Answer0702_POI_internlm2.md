**Deliverables:**

1. Python script implementing the fuzzy logic control system for the chemical reactor.
2. Detailed docstring explaining the code methods and their purpose.
3. Simulation results comparing the performance of the fuzzy controller against a traditional PID controller.
4. Visualizations illustrating the reactor's behavior under different operating conditions and the effectiveness of the fuzzy control.

**Execution:**

1. Clone the repository containing the Python script.
2. Install any necessary Python packages (e.g., NumPy, Matplotlib, PyFuzzyLite).
3. Run the Python script.
4. Analyze the results and visualizations to assess the performance of the fuzzy logic controller.

**Expected Outcomes:**

The fuzzy logic control system should effectively regulate the chemical reactor's key variables, ensuring optimal performance under varying operating conditions. The simulation results should demonstrate that the fuzzy controller outperforms the traditional PID controller in terms of stability, responsiveness, and adaptability to process uncertainties.

**Additional Notes:**

- The chemical reactor dynamics can be modeled using a set of nonlinear differential equations.
- The fuzzy logic control system should be designed to handle imprecise inputs and adjust control actions in real time.
- The simulation should consider different scenarios, including steady-state operation, transient response, and disturbance rejection.
- The performance comparison should be based on relevant metrics such as overshoot, settling time, and steady-state error.
- The visualizations should clearly illustrate the reactor's behavior and the effectiveness of the fuzzy control in managing the process variables.

**Python Code:**

```python
# Import necessary libraries
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from pyfuzzylite import FuzzySystem, FuzzyRule, FuzzyVariable, trapezoidal_membership_function

# Define the chemical reactor variables
temperature = FuzzyVariable('Temperature', 0, 100)
pressure = FuzzyVariable('Pressure', 0, 10)
reaction_rate = FuzzyVariable('Reaction Rate', 0, 1)

# Define the fuzzy sets for each variable
temperature.sets = ['Low', 'Medium', 'High']
pressure.sets = ['Low', 'Medium', 'High']
reaction_rate.sets = ['Low', 'Medium', 'High']

# Define the membership functions for each fuzzy set
temperature.mf_low = trapezoidal_membership_function(0, 20, 40, 60, 100)
temperature.mf_medium = trape
