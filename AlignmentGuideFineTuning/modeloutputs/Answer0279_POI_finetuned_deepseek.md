### Intent:
**Intent Summary:**  
Create a reusable IEC 61131-3 Structured Text function block (`SineFunction`) to compute the sine of an angle in radians, supporting both built-in `SIN()` and a fallback Taylor series approximation, with input validation, error handling, and diagnostic logging for real-time PLC applications like motion control.  

*(Focus: Modularity, precision, real-time safety, and platform flexibility.)*

### Prompt:
**Sine Function**

Develop a self-contained function block in IEC 61131-3 Structured Text to compute the sine of a given angle in radians. Ensure that the function block is modular and reusable, with appropriate comments detailing the mathematical operations involved. Include a discussion on the precision of the sine function within the context of PLC programming and its potential limitations in real-time applications.

**C-A-R-E:**

ðŸŸ¥ C (Context) â€“ The Background

Trigonometric functions like sine are fundamental in many industrial applications such as robotics, oscillatory motion control, waveform generation, and sensor signal interpretation. In IEC 61131-3 Structured Text environments, built-in math libraries are sometimes limited or vary in precision depending on the PLC runtime. Therefore, a reusable and efficient function block for computing the sine of a given angle is essential for reliable real-time applications.

ðŸŸ© A (Action) â€“ The Implementation Task

Create a modular and reusable function block in IEC 61131-3 Structured Text, named SineFunction, that:
	â€¢	Accepts one input:
	â€¢	AngleRad : REAL â€” the angle in radians
	â€¢	Returns one output:
	â€¢	SineValue : REAL â€” the sine of the input angle
	â€¢	Uses either:
	â€¢	The built-in SIN() function (if available), or
	â€¢	A Taylor series approximation for platforms without SIN()
	â€¢	Includes detailed inline comments explaining:
	â€¢	The mathematical foundation of the sine function
	â€¢	The expected input domain (in radians)
	â€¢	Any assumptions or limitations of the approximation
	â€¢	Handles real-time constraints by:
	â€¢	Keeping calculations deterministic (no recursion or deep nesting)
	â€¢	Ensuring bounded execution time within PLC scan cycles

â¸»

ðŸŸ¨ R (Result) â€“ The Expected Outcome

You will create a reliable, real-time-capable function block that:
	â€¢	Accurately computes the sine value for an input angle
	â€¢	Can be safely reused across motion, timing, and signal processing applications
	â€¢	Performs within the limitations of typical PLC hardware
	â€¢	Is well-documented for easy maintenance and troubleshooting
	â€¢	Discusses limitations such as:
	â€¢	Approximation errors for large inputs
	â€¢	Potential drift without normalization
	â€¢	Precision constraints of REAL types

ðŸŸ¦ E (Example) â€“ A Practical Use Case

In a pick-and-place robot arm, you want to simulate sinusoidal end-effector motion along the Y-axis based on time:
SineFunction.AngleRad := 2.0 * 3.1415 * TimeInSec; // 1 Hz sine wave
SineFunction(); 
Y_Position := Amplitude * SineFunction.SineValue;
This enables smooth periodic motion directly from the PLC, without requiring external math libraries. If SIN() is unavailable, a Taylor series implementation ensures fallback capability.
