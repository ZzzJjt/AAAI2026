### Intent:
**Intent Summary:**  
Create a reusable IEC 61131-3 Structured Text function block for linear interpolation between two points, with safeguards against division by zero, clear documentation, and considerations for real-time industrial control precision and performance.  

*(Key focus: General-purpose interpolation, robustness, and real-time suitability.)*

### Prompt:
**Linear Interpolation:**

Create a self-contained function block in IEC 61131-3 Structured Text to compute linear interpolation between two points. Ensure the function block is designed for general use, with detailed comments explaining the mathematical formula behind the interpolation process. Discuss considerations for precision and potential rounding errors, as well as the function blockâ€™s suitability for use in industrial control systems where real-time responsiveness is critical.

**R-T-F:**

ðŸŸ¥ R (Role) â€“ Your Role

You are a PLC programmer or automation systems developer tasked with creating a general-purpose linear interpolation function block using IEC 61131-3 Structured Text for use in real-time industrial control applications.

â¸»

ðŸŸ© T (Task) â€“ What You Need to Do

Develop a function block named LinearInterpolation that:
	â€¢	Accepts five REAL inputs:
	â€¢	X1, Y1: First reference point
	â€¢	X2, Y2: Second reference point
	â€¢	X: The target input value
	â€¢	Computes Y, the interpolated output value, using the formula:
Y := Y1 + ((X - X1) \times (Y2 - Y1)) / (X2 - X1)
	â€¢	Includes logic to prevent division by zero if X1 = X2
	â€¢	Provides inline comments to explain each computation step, including mathematical rationale
	â€¢	Addresses precision and rounding concerns inherent to REAL types on PLCs
	â€¢	Is suitable for integration into real-time control systems, ensuring deterministic execution

â¸»

ðŸŸ§ F (Format) â€“ Expected Output

Your deliverable should include:
	â€¢	A fully implemented IEC 61131-3 Structured Text function block with clear input/output declarations
	â€¢	The interpolation logic wrapped in safe conditionals:

 IF X2 <> X1 THEN
    Y := Y1 + ((X - X1) * (Y2 - Y1)) / (X2 - X1);
ELSE
    Y := Y1; // Default or fallback behavior
END_IF;
	â€¢	Well-documented code with comments explaining how interpolation is computed and why safeguards are in place
	â€¢	A brief summary of:
	â€¢	Use cases (e.g., analog signal scaling, lookup tables, PID feedforward inputs)
	â€¢	Considerations for execution time, numerical stability, and portability across platforms like CODESYS, TwinCAT, and TIA Portal
