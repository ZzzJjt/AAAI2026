### Intent:
**Intent Summary:**  
Develop a feedforward control program in IEC 61131-3 Structured Text to adjust conveyor speed preemptively based on predicted load input, ensuring efficient operation within defined speed limits.

### Prompt:
**PID pH Control:**

Develop a self-contained IEC 61131-3 Structured Text program (not a function block) to implement PID feedback control for pH regulation in a process. The program should continuously adjust the addition of acid or base to maintain the pH setpoint, ensuring accurate control in dynamic conditions.

Include the PID parameters (proportional, integral, and derivative gains) and the control logic to handle deviations from the target pH. The program should incorporate safeguards to prevent extreme pH levels by setting operational limits for the dosing mechanism. Discuss the challenges of pH control in industrial processes, particularly focusing on system response time, non-linear behavior of pH control, and maintaining process stability under varying input conditions.

**C-A-R-E:**

ðŸŸ¥ C (Context) â€“ The Background

In industrial chemical processes, pH regulation is a delicate and nonlinear control challenge. Especially near neutral pH (7.0), small amounts of acid or base can cause large pH swings. Failing to maintain stable pH can result in corrosion, product inconsistencies, or process failures. A reliable PID control system is necessary to provide stable and precise dosing of acid or base in response to fluctuations.

ðŸŸ© A (Action) â€“ What to Implement

Develop a self-contained IEC 61131-3 Structured Text program (not a function block) that:
	â€¢	Continuously monitors pH_PV (measured pH value)
	â€¢	Compares it to a defined setpoint (pH_SP := 7.0)
	â€¢	Uses a PID control algorithm with configurable Kp, Ki, and Kd gains
	â€¢	Adjusts the dosing output to an acid/base addition system
	â€¢	Applies output clamping to prevent unsafe over-dosing and pH extremes
	â€¢	Updates every 100 ms for real-time process response

â¸»

ðŸŸ¨ R (Result) â€“ What You Should Achieve

This program should:
	â€¢	Maintain stable and accurate pH regulation despite nonlinear dynamics
	â€¢	React quickly to process changes and neutralization requirements
	â€¢	Prevent overshooting or undershooting, protecting both product and equipment
	â€¢	Be robust for real-time PLC deployment and ready for tuning across different process scales
