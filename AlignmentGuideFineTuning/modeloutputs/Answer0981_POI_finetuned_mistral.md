### Intent:
**Intent Summary:**  
Create an automated control system for LNG vaporization with instrumentation (flow, temperature, valves) to regulate the process from storage to gas output.  

*(Focused on LNG flow/temperature control with valves and meters, analogous to the beer brewing process's need for setpoints and instrumentation.)*

### Prompt:
**Control Narrative Beer Brewing:**

Create a control narrative for beer brewing including concrete setpoints and ranges.

Create a detailed explanation of the Lautering process (Section 4). Include the equipment and instrumentation needed. Provide a list of the steps to execute.

**T-A-G:**

ðŸŸ¥ T (Task)

Create a control narrative for an automated beer brewing process, with emphasis on specifying concrete setpoints and detailing the lautering phase (Section 4).

â¸»

ðŸŸ© A (Action)
	â€¢	Define the brewing process stages, including specific setpoints and control ranges for parameters like temperature, flow rate, and volume.
	â€¢	In Section 4 â€“ Lautering, include:
	â€¢	A list of required equipment: lauter tun, rake motor, sparge system, wort pump
	â€¢	A list of required instrumentation: turbidity meter, flow transmitter, level sensor, temperature probe
	â€¢	A step-by-step procedure for the lautering process, such as:
	1.	Start recirculation of wort
	2.	Monitor turbidity; wait until it drops below 200 NTU
	3.	Begin transferring wort to the kettle
	4.	Add sparge water at 76â€¯Â°C to maintain lauter tun level between 60â€“80%
	5.	Stop process based on turbidity or volume criteria
	â€¢	Include interlock logic, such as:
	â€¢	IF Turbidity > Limit THEN open waste valve
	â€¢	IF Level < Minimum THEN stop sparging

â¸»

ðŸŸ¦ G (Goal)

Deliver a clear, structured, and automation-ready control narrative that can be used by control engineers, brewers, and programmers to ensure consistency, quality, and operational reliability in the beer brewing processâ€”especially during the critical lautering phase.

### Control Narrative for LNG Vaporization System

#### 1. Overview
The LNG vaporization system is designed to convert liquid LNG into gas for distribution to downstream consumers. The system consists of a storage tank, vaporizer, flow control valves, temperature control loops, and instrumentation to ensure safe and efficient operation. The control narrative specifies the process, setpoints, and control logic to maintain stable and efficient vaporization.

#### 2. Process Description
The LNG vaporization process involves the following steps:
- **Storage**: LNG is stored in a cryogenic tank at -162Â°C.
- **Vaporization**: LNG is pumped from the tank to a vaporizer, where it is heated to convert to gas.
- **Flow Control**: The gas flow is regulated using a control valve to match the downstream demand.
- **Temperature Control**: The vaporizer temperature is maintained using a temperature control loop.

#### 3. Instrumentation and Equipment
- **Tank Level Transmitter**: Measures LNG level in the storage tank.
- **Flow Meter**: Measures gas flow from the vaporizer.
- **Temperature Sensor**: Measures vaporizer temperature.
- **Control Valve**: Adjusts gas flow to match downstream demand.
- **Heater**: Heats the vaporizer.
- **Pump**: Pumps LNG from the tank to the vaporizer.

#### 4. Control Loops

##### 4.1 Tank Level Control Loop
- **Setpoint**: 90% tank capacity.
- **Control Action**: If tank level drops below 90%, the pump is started to refill the tank.

##### 4.2 Flow Control Loop
- **Setpoint**: Flow rate is adjusted to match downstream demand.
- **Control Action**: The control valve is adjusted to maintain the desired flow rate.

##### 4.3 Temperature Control Loop
- **Setpoint**: 20Â°C (vaporization temperature).
- **Control Action**: The heater is adjusted to maintain the vaporizer temperature at 20Â°C.

#### 5. Control Logic

##### 5.1 Startup
