### Intent:
**Intent Summary:**  
Create an IEC 61131-3 Structured Text function block to safely compute the natural logarithm of a REAL input, handling domain errors (non-positive values) and optimizing for real-time PLC performance, with clear documentation on mathematical principles and edge-case handling.  

**For the simplex solver example:**  
Implement a PLC function block to solve linear programming problems (maximization) using the simplex method, handling constraints and variables within industrial automation limits, with outputs for solution status and optimal values.  

*(Choose the summary matching your target taskâ€”logarithm or solver.)*

### Prompt:
**Natural Logarithm:**

Develop a self-contained function block in IEC 61131-3 Structured Text to compute the natural logarithm of a given input. Ensure that the implementation is efficient and well-documented, with comments explaining the mathematical foundation of the natural logarithm. Additionally, address potential edge cases, such as handling non-positive inputs, and discuss the precision and performance of this function block in typical industrial applications.

ðŸŸ¥ R (Role) â€“ Your Role

You are a PLC software developer or control systems engineer responsible for implementing mathematical functions in IEC 61131-3 Structured Text for use in real-time industrial automation systems. Your goal is to ensure both computational correctness and system safety when executing advanced mathematical operations.

ðŸŸ© I (Input) â€“ What Youâ€™re Given

You are required to implement a function block that:
	â€¢	Computes the natural logarithm of a single input value
	â€¢	Accepts an input:
X : REAL â€“ a value for which ln(X) is to be calculated
	â€¢	Outputs:
	â€¢	LnX : REAL â€“ the natural logarithm of X
	â€¢	Error : BOOL â€“ indicates whether the input is out of domain (i.e., X â‰¤ 0)
	â€¢	Must handle edge cases like X = 0 or negative values safely
	â€¢	Needs to run efficiently within the scan-time limits of a PLC
	â€¢	May use the built-in LN() function or implement a fallback approximation if necessary

â¸»

ðŸŸ§ S (Steps) â€“ What You Need to Do
	1.	Create a function block named NaturalLog:
 FUNCTION_BLOCK NaturalLog
VAR_INPUT
    X : REAL;
END_VAR
VAR_OUTPUT
    LnX : REAL;
    Error : BOOL;
END_VAR
	2.	Implement logic for computing the logarithm:
	â€¢	If X > 0, use LN(X) and set Error := FALSE
	â€¢	If X â‰¤ 0, return a default value (0.0 or -9999.0) and set Error := TRUE
	â€¢	Optionally include a diagnostic log or fault code for error tracking
	3.	Comment clearly on:
	â€¢	Why ln(x) is undefined for non-positive values
	â€¢	The mathematical relationship between logarithms and exponentials
	â€¢	Real-time implications of using a built-in vs. custom implementation
	4.	Optimize for execution:
	â€¢	Use straight-line logic (no loops or recursion)
	â€¢	Ensure that the logic fits within standard scan times
	â€¢	Validate with test cases for edge inputs like 0.0001, 1, 1000, and -5

ðŸŸ¦ E (Expectation) â€“ What Success Looks Like

You produce a robust and reusable function block that:
	â€¢	Correctly calculates the natural logarithm for valid inputs
	â€¢	Handles domain errors gracefully and safely
	â€¢	Provides diagnostic feedback without crashing the control program
	â€¢	Is lightweight, readable, and suitable for real-time use in industrial applications such as:
	â€¢	Sensor calibration
	â€¢	Flow and pressure linearization
	â€¢	Exponential decay modeling
