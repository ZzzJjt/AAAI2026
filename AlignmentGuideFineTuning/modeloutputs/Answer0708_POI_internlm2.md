**Detailed Requirements:**

1. **Dynamic Model:**
	- Create a dynamic model of the turbine's thermal behavior, including the steam generator, turbine, and heat recovery steam generator (HRSG).
	- The model should account for heat transfer, fluid flow, and energy conversion processes.
	- Include parameters such as heat capacities, thermal conductivities, fluid properties, and control valve characteristics.
	- The model should be able to simulate the system's response to changes in load and disturbances.

2. **MPC Algorithm:**
	- Implement a model predictive control algorithm to optimize the turbine's performance.
	- The algorithm should consider the dynamic model and operational constraints.
	- Define a predictive horizon and control horizon for the MPC.
	- Use a suitable optimization algorithm (e.g., quadratic program, linear program) to find the optimal control actions.
	- Include constraints for actuator limits, safety limits, and other operational constraints.

3. **Simulation Logic:**
	- Develop simulation logic to apply varying load conditions and external disturbances to the system.
	- The simulation should include realistic load profiles and disturbances (e.g., changes in ambient temperature, turbine inlet pressure).
	- The simulation should update the dynamic model and MPC algorithm in real-time.

4. **Output Analysis:**
	- Provide text-based or logged output for analysis, including control actions, energy use, and system stability metrics.
	- The output should be time-stamped and include relevant information for evaluating the performance of the MPC algorithm.
	- Include plots or visualizations to illustrate the system's response and the effectiveness of the MPC.

**Deliverables:**

- A Python script that implements the MPC algorithm for turbine optimization in a thermal power plant.
- A detailed docstring explaining the code methods and their purpose.
- A report summarizing the implementation, including a description of the dynamic model, MPC algorithm, simulation logic, and output analysis.
- A presentation showcasing the MPC algorithm's performance and highlighting key findings.

**Additional Notes:**

- The Python script should be well-documented and modular, with clear function and class definitions.
- Use appropriate libraries and tools for numerical computation, optimization, and data analysis (e.g., NumPy, SciPy, Pandas, Matplotlib).
- Ensure the code is well-commented and follows Python best practices.
- Test the code thoroughly to ensure it works as expected under various scenarios and load conditions
