### Intent:
**Intent Summary:**  
Design an ASCII-art Function Block Diagram (FBD) for a 61131-3 control loop where an analog input feeds both a timer and a PID block, with the PID output driving an analog output, including labeled signals and connections.  

*(Focused on the original FBD task, excluding the unrelated ethanol process narrative.)*

### Prompt:
**FBD PID:**

Create a 61131-3 function block diagram in ASCII art. It shall contain an analog input, a timer block, and a PID block as well as an analog output. The analog input feeds both the timer and the PID block. Only the PID block is connected to the analog output. Provide typical input and output signals for each function block and show them inside each block.

**T-A-G:**

ðŸŸ¥ T (Task)

Design a 61131-3 Function Block Diagram (FBD) using ASCII art that visually represents a basic control structure involving an analog input, a timer, a PID controller, and an analog output.

â¸»

ðŸŸ© A (Action)
	â€¢	Create a clear ASCII layout with the following blocks:
	â€¢	Analog Input block (OUT = AI)
	â€¢	TON timer block (IN = AI, ET, Q)
	â€¢	PID block (PV = AI, SP = 50.0, CV)
	â€¢	Analog Output block (IN = CV)
	â€¢	Ensure the Analog Input feeds both the TON and the PID block.
	â€¢	Show that only the PIDâ€™s output (CV) connects to the Analog Output.
	â€¢	Use ASCII symbols (+-----+, -->, |) to create block shapes and signal lines.
	â€¢	Label all signals clearly inside or beside the blocks.

ðŸŸ¦ G (Goal)

Produce a plain-text diagram that visually communicates the data flow and block interaction within a control loopâ€”useful for documentation, PLC training, version-controlled codebases, or text-only environments where graphical editors are unavailable.

### Ethanol Production Process Description

This document describes the ethanol production process from raw material preparation to final product distillation, following the IEC 61131-3 standard for PLC programming. The process includes the following stages:

1. **Raw Material Preparation**:
   - Corn is received and stored in a silo.
   - Water is added to the corn to create a mash.
   - The mash is heated to 70Â°C to activate enzymes.
   - The heated mash is cooled to 35Â°C for fermentation.

2. **Fermentation**:
   - Yeast is added to the cooled mash to convert sugars into ethanol.
   - The fermentation process takes approximately 48 hours.
   - The fermented liquid is transferred to the distillation unit.

3. **Distillation**:
   - The fermented liquid is heated in a distillation column.
   - Ethanol vapor rises to the top of the column, while water and impurities condense and are removed from the bottom.
   - The distilled ethanol is collected and stored for further processing.

### Function Block Diagram (FBD) in ASCII Art

The following ASCII art represents a Function Block Diagram (FBD) for the ethanol production process, showing the main stages and control signals between function blocks. Each function block represents a logical step in the process, and the arrows between them indicate signal flow.
