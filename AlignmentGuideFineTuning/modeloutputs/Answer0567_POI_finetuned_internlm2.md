### Intent:
**Intent Summary:**  
Develop a PID pressure control program in IEC 61131-3 Structured Text to regulate a chemical reactor's pressure by adjusting a control valve, using defined gains and safety limits to ensure stability and prevent over/under-pressurization.

### Prompt:
**PID Pressure Control Chemical Reactor:**

Develop a self-contained IEC 61131-3 Structured Text program to implement PID feedback control for regulating the pressure in a chemical reactor. The program should continuously adjust the opening of a pressure control valve based on a setpoint to maintain optimal pressure levels within the reactor.

Include the PID control loop parameters (proportional, integral, and derivative gains) and ensure the logic accounts for pressure deviations from the setpoint. The program should also include safeguards to prevent over-pressurization or under-pressurization by limiting the valveâ€™s operational range. Discuss the critical role of pressure control in chemical reactors, emphasizing safety, process efficiency, and system stability under dynamic reaction conditions.

ðŸŸ© I (Input) â€“ What Youâ€™re Given
	â€¢	Pressure_PV: Measured pressure inside the reactor (in bar)
	â€¢	Pressure_SP: Target pressure setpoint (e.g., 5.0 bar)
	â€¢	PID gains:
	â€¢	Kp := 2.0 (proportional gain)
	â€¢	Ki := 0.8 (integral gain)
	â€¢	Kd := 0.3 (derivative gain)
	â€¢	Valve limits:
	â€¢	Valve_Min := 0.0 (% open)
	â€¢	Valve_Max := 100.0 (% open)
	â€¢	Sampling time: 100 milliseconds

â¸»

ðŸŸ§ S (Steps) â€“ What You Need to Do
	1.	Compute the error between the setpoint and measured pressure:
Error := Pressure_SP - Pressure_PV
	2.	Update the integral term:
Integral := Integral + Error * 0.1
	3.	Compute the derivative term:
Derivative := (Error - Prev_Error) / 0.1
	4.	Calculate the PID output to control the valve position:
Valve_Output := (Kp * Error) + (Ki * Integral) + (Kd * Derivative)
	5.	Clamp the output within the valveâ€™s operational range:
	â€¢	If above Valve_Max, set to max
	â€¢	If below Valve_Min, set to min
	6.	Store the current error as Prev_Error for the next loop

ðŸŸ¦ E (Expectation) â€“ What Success Looks Like

The control logic should:
	â€¢	Maintain safe and stable pressure inside the reactor under varying reaction conditions
	â€¢	Quickly adjust to disturbances such as gas generation or reaction acceleration
	â€¢	Prevent over-pressurization or vacuum conditions using output limits
	â€¢	Be suitable for real-time PLC control and robust under industrial operating constraints
