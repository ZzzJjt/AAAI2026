### Intent:
**Intent Summary:**  
Create a Structured Text function block to compute eigenvalues of a 10Ã—10 matrix for industrial control applications using the Power Method with deflation, including input validation, convergence checks, and error handling.

### Prompt:
**Natural Logarithm:**

Develop a self-contained function block in IEC 61131-3 Structured Text to compute the natural logarithm of a given input. Ensure that the implementation is efficient and well-documented, with comments explaining the mathematical foundation of the natural logarithm. Additionally, address potential edge cases, such as handling non-positive inputs, and discuss the precision and performance of this function block in typical industrial applications.

**R-T-F:**

ðŸŸ¥ R (Role) â€“ Your Role

You are a PLC programmer or automation engineer developing core mathematical utilities in IEC 61131-3 Structured Text to support real-time calculations in industrial control systems.

ðŸŸ© T (Task) â€“ What You Need to Do

Create a self-contained function block named NaturalLog that:
	â€¢	Computes the natural logarithm (ln) of a given input X
	â€¢	Uses built-in LN() where available, or prepares to support an approximation method
	â€¢	Accepts:
	â€¢	X : REAL â€“ the input value
	â€¢	Returns:
	â€¢	LnX : REAL â€“ the result of ln(X)
	â€¢	Error : BOOL â€“ set to TRUE if X <= 0 (invalid input)

You should also:
	â€¢	Add clear inline comments explaining:
	â€¢	The mathematical basis of ln(x)
	â€¢	Why inputs must be strictly positive
	â€¢	What happens when the input is out of domain
	â€¢	Ensure the logic is efficient and deterministic, suitable for execution in a PLC scan cycle
	â€¢	Discuss limitations in precision and range and any implications for real-time control

ðŸŸ§ F (Format) â€“ Expected Output

You should deliver:
	â€¢	A complete and readable IEC 61131-3 Structured Text function block:
 FUNCTION_BLOCK NaturalLog
VAR_INPUT
    X : REAL;
END_VAR
VAR_OUTPUT
    LnX : REAL;
    Error : BOOL;
END_VAR

IF X > 0.0 THEN
    LnX := LN(X);    // Use built-in function
    Error := FALSE;
ELSE
    LnX := 0.0;      // Default fallback
    Error := TRUE;   // Invalid input
END_IF;
	â€¢	Documentation that describes:
	â€¢	The use of LN() and its mathematical meaning
	â€¢	Proper input ranges and safe output behavior
	â€¢	Suitability of the block for tasks such as:
	â€¢	Flow signal scaling
	â€¢	Sensor linearization
	â€¢	Exponential modeling in energy applications
