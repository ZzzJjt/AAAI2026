### Intent:
**Intent Summary:**  
Create a reusable, configurable PID controller function block in IEC 61131-3 Structured Text with tunable gains, anti-windup, output clamping, and error handling for precise industrial process control (e.g., temperature, pressure) on PLCs.  

*(Key features: modularity, safety, diagnostics, and scan-cycle compatibility.)*

### Prompt:
**PID Controller:**
Implement a self-contained function block in IEC 61131-3 structured text to create a PID controller. Include configurable parameters for proportional, integral, and derivative gains, with error handling and tuning capability.


**B-A-B:**

ðŸŸ¥ B (Before) â€“ The Problem or Challenge

In industrial automation systems, maintaining precise control over temperature, pressure, flow, or position is critical. Without a reliable and tunable PID controller, systems may experience instability, overshoot, or slow response. Many basic PID implementations lack configurable gains, anti-windup measures, or proper error handling, making them unsuitable for complex or sensitive processes when deployed on a PLC using IEC 61131-3 Structured Text.

ðŸŸ© A (After) â€“ The Desired Outcome

Develop a self-contained function block in IEC 61131-3 Structured Text that implements a standard PID controller. The block should:
	â€¢	Include tunable parameters for proportional (Kp), integral (Ki), and derivative (Kd) gains
	â€¢	Support error calculation and handle input setpoint and process variable
	â€¢	Include safeguards such as integral windup prevention, output clamping, and reset logic
	â€¢	Be modular, scan-cycle-safe, and easily integrable into control loops
	â€¢	Provide intuitive input/output structure with documentation for users and maintainers

â¸»

ðŸŸ§ B (Bridge) â€“ How to Get There
	1.	Define inputs for:
	â€¢	Setpoint : REAL
	â€¢	ProcessVariable : REAL
	â€¢	Kp, Ki, Kd : REAL
	â€¢	Enable, Reset : BOOL
	â€¢	MinOutput, MaxOutput : REAL
	2.	Calculate:
	â€¢	Error = Setpoint â€“ ProcessVariable
	â€¢	Integral term with anti-windup (limit or back-calculate)
	â€¢	Derivative term using difference in process variable
	3.	Output:
	â€¢	ControlOutput : REAL
	â€¢	Optionally, Error, IntegralTerm, and DerivativeTerm for monitoring
	4.	Add structured comments and logic separation (e.g., IF Enable THEN ...)
	5.	Ensure the block behaves predictably under all input conditions
