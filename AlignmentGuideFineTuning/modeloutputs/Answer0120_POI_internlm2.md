### Intent:
**Intent Summary:**

### Prompt:
**Ratio Control Mixing:**

Develop a self-contained IEC 61131-3 Structured Text program (not a function block) to implement ratio control for mixing two reactants in a 2:1 ratio.

ðŸŸ¥ B (Before) â€“ The Challenge

In continuous chemical mixing processes, maintaining the correct mixing ratio of reactants is essential for ensuring product quality and process efficiency. Without ratio control, deviations in flow due to pump inconsistencies or process disturbances can result in incorrect formulations, leading to off-spec products, waste, or even hazardous reactions.

Hereâ€™s an example Structured Text implementation of the ratio control logic:

VAR
    Flow_A_PV : REAL;               // Measured flow rate of reactant A
    Flow_B_PV : REAL;               // Measured flow rate of reactant B
    Flow_B_SP : REAL;               // Setpoint flow for reactant B

    Ratio_Setpoint : REAL := 2.0;   // Desired ratio A:B = 2:1
    Tolerance : REAL := 0.05;       // Acceptable ratio error margin

    Actual_Ratio : REAL;
    Error : REAL;
END_VAR

// Calculate actual ratio
IF Flow_B_PV > 0.0 THEN
    Actual_Ratio := Flow_A_PV / Flow_B_PV;
ELSE
    Actual_Ratio := 0.0;
END_IF

// Calculate target flow for reactant B
Flow_B_SP := Flow_A_PV / Ratio_Setpoint;

// Check deviation
Error := Actual_Ratio - Ratio_Setpoint;

// Optional: Take action if Error exceeds tolerance
// (e.g., raise an alarm, adjust valves, etc.)

// Flow_B_SP can be sent to a PID loop or analog output to control pump B

// Flow_B_SP can be sent to a PID loop or analog output to control pump B

// Repeat the above steps at regular intervals (e.g., every 100 ms)

This example demonstrates the basic logic for maintaining a 2:1 ratio between two reactants. The program continuously monitors the flow rates of both reactants, calculates the actual ratio, and adjusts the flow rate of reactant B to maintain the desired ratio. The program also includes an error margin to account for minor deviations and can be extended to include additional actions or controls based on the specific requirements of the process.

**Disturbance Handling:**

Disturbances in the mixing process can arise from various sources, such as pump malfunctions, changes in the chemical properties of the reactants, or variations in the process conditions. To handle these disturbances, the ratio control logic should be designed to detect and respond to deviations from the target ratio.

Here are some strategies for handling disturbances:

1. **Monitoring and Alarm System:** Implement a monitoring system to continuously check the actual ratio against the setpoint. If the deviation exceeds a predefined tolerance, raise an alarm to notify operators of the issue.
2. **PID Control:** Use a proportional-integral-derivative (PID) controller to adjust the flow rate of reactant B in response to the error signal. The PID controller can help dampen the effects of disturbances and maintain the desired ratio more effectively.
3. **Adaptive Control:** Implement an adaptive control strategy that can learn from past disturbances and adjust the control parameters accordingly. This can help improve the system's ability to handle recurring disturbances and optimize the control performance over time.
4. **Model Predictive Control:** Utilize model predictive control (MPC) to anticipate the impact of disturbances on the system and adjust the control signals proactively. MPC can take into account the dynamic behavior of the process and provide more precise control actions.
5. **Fault Detection and Diagnostics:** Incorporate fault detection and diagnostics (FDD) techniques to identify the source of disturbances and take appropriate actions. This can help prevent further process degradation and minimize the impact of disturbances on the mixing process.

By incorporating these strategies into the ratio control logic, the system can effectively handle disturbances and maintain the desired 2:1 ratio between the two reactants, ensuring consistent chemical composition and process efficiency.

**Conclusion:**

Implementing ratio control logic in a continuous chemical mixing process is crucial for maintaining the desired chemical composition and process efficiency. By dynamically adjusting the flow rates of reactants A
