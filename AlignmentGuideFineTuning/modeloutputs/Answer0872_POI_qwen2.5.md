### Intent:
**Intent Summary:**  
Develop a Structured Text function block to calculate the mean and sample standard deviation of a fixed-size (100-element) integer array for industrial PLC applications, with input validation, error handling, and real-time performance considerations.

### Prompt:
**Fast Fourier Transform:**

Develop a self-contained function block in IEC 61131-3 Structured Text to compute the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) of a given input array. Ensure that the implementation is efficient and includes detailed comments explaining the algorithmic steps involved in computing the FFT. Discuss any limitations in terms of computational complexity and real-time performance, as well as considerations for handling input size constraints typically found in industrial control systems.

ðŸŸ¥ T (Task) â€“ What You Need to Do

Develop a self-contained function block in IEC 61131-3 Structured Text that computes the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) of a fixed-size input array for use in industrial automation environments.

â¸»

ðŸŸ© A (Action) â€“ How to Do It
	1.	Create a function block named FFT_Block that takes a REAL[1..N] input array (where N is a power of two, e.g., 64).
	2.	Implement the Cooley-Tukey radix-2 FFT algorithm, including:
	â€¢	Bit-reversal reordering
	â€¢	Butterfly computation
	â€¢	Application of twiddle factors (precomputed sine and cosine values)
	3.	Output the results as either:
	â€¢	A magnitude array representing the amplitude spectrum, or
	â€¢	Separate real and imaginary arrays for each frequency bin
	4.	Include detailed comments in the code explaining each stage of the algorithm.
	5.	Account for PLC limitations by:
	â€¢	Fixing input size
	â€¢	Avoiding recursion
	â€¢	Keeping execution within acceptable cycle times
	6.	Document key considerations such as numerical precision, convergence issues, and the impact on real-time performance.

â¸»

ðŸŸ¦ G (Goal) â€“ What You Want to Achieve

Deliver a modular, well-documented FFT function block that enables real-time spectral analysis directly on a PLC. This will support applications like:
	â€¢	Vibration and acoustic monitoring
	â€¢	Motor fault detection
	â€¢	Power quality analysis
	â€¢	Predictive maintenance

The solution should provide reliable frequency-domain insights within the constraints of industrial control hardware.
