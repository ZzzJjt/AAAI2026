### Intent:
The task is to develop a PID control program in Structured Text for maintaining a target chlorine concentration (3.0 ppm) in water treatment by adjusting dosing rates within safe operational limits (0-10 ppm), while handling measurement validation, anti-windup protection, and 100ms control cycles.

### Prompt:
**PID pH Control:**

Develop a self-contained IEC 61131-3 Structured Text program (not a function block) to implement PID feedback control for pH regulation in a process. The program should continuously adjust the addition of acid or base to maintain the pH setpoint, ensuring accurate control in dynamic conditions.

Include the PID parameters (proportional, integral, and derivative gains) and the control logic to handle deviations from the target pH. The program should incorporate safeguards to prevent extreme pH levels by setting operational limits for the dosing mechanism. Discuss the challenges of pH control in industrial processes, particularly focusing on system response time, non-linear behavior of pH control, and maintaining process stability under varying input conditions.

**R-T-F:**

ðŸŸ¥ R (Role) â€“ Your Role

ðŸŸ© T (Task) â€“ What You Need to Do

Write a self-contained Structured Text program (not a function block) that performs the following:
	1.	Continuously measures the current pH value (pH_PV) and compares it to a desired setpoint (pH_SP := 7.0)
	2.	Implements a PID control algorithm using:
	â€¢	Kp := 2.5
	â€¢	Ki := 0.6
	â€¢	Kd := 0.3
	3.	Calculates the control output every 100 ms to adjust the acid/base dosing rate
	4.	Includes output clamping between 0.0 and 100.0 to prevent unsafe dosing
	5.	Maintains previous error values for derivative calculation

ðŸŸ¦ F (Format) â€“ Output Format

The program output should be a clean, readable Structured Text block like this:

VAR
    pH_PV : REAL;                      // Measured pH value
    pH_SP : REAL := 7.0;               // Target pH

    // PID gains
    Kp : REAL := 2.5;
    Ki : REAL := 0.6;
    Kd : REAL := 0.3;

    // Internal PID variables
    Error : REAL;
    Prev_Error : REAL := 0.0;
    Integral : REAL := 0.0;
    Derivative : REAL;
    Dosing_Output : REAL;

    // Output limits
    Dosing_Min : REAL := 0.0;
    Dosing_Max : REAL := 100.0;
END_VAR

// PID control logic (100 ms loop)
Error := pH_SP - pH_PV;
Integral := Integral + Error * 0.1;
Derivative := (Error - Prev_Error) / 0.1;

Dosing_Output := (Kp * Error) + (Ki * Integral) + (Kd * Derivative);

// Clamp output for safety
IF Dosing_Output > Dosing_Max THEN
    Dosing_Output := Dosing_Max;
ELSIF Dosing_Output < Dosing_Min THEN
    Dosing_Output := Dosing_Min;
END_IF

Prev_Error := Error;
