🟥 R (Role) – Your Role

You are a control systems or PLC programmer tasked with implementing a mathematical function block capable of calculating eigenvalues from a 10×10 matrix using IEC 61131-3 Structured Text.

⸻

🟩 T (Task) – What You Need to Do

Create a self-contained function block named ComputeEigenvalues_10x10 that:
	•	Accepts a REAL[10,10] matrix as input
	•	Computes and returns its eigenvalues as a REAL[10] array
	•	Implements a suitable eigenvalue estimation algorithm (e.g., Power Method or simplified QR iteration)
	•	Includes detailed comments within the code to explain each step of the process
	•	Optimizes execution for PLC performance, ensuring the algorithm runs efficiently within real-time constraints
	•	Accounts for issues such as:
	•	Numerical stability (e.g., normalization, underflow/overflow)
	•	Convergence control (e.g., iteration limits, thresholds)
	•	Fallback behavior in case of non-convergence or timeout

Additionally, describe how eigenvalue analysis is relevant in industrial applications such as system modeling, vibration detection, and control tuning.

🟧 F (Format) – Expected Output

Your deliverable should include:
	•	A full IEC 61131-3 Structured Text code block for the ComputeEigenvalues_10x10 function block
	•	Clear variable definitions for inputs, outputs, and internal states
	•	Inline comments that guide readers through matrix operations, iteration steps, and convergence checks
	•	A brief written explanation discussing:
	•	The challenges of performing matrix algebra on PLCs
	•	Why eigenvalue interlocks or estimations might be useful in real-time industrial control
	•	How the block can be tested and reused in modular control systems
