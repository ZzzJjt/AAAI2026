ðŸŸ© T (Task) â€“ What You Need to Do

Create a self-contained function block named ComputeEigenvalues_10x10 that:
	â€¢	Accepts a REAL[10,10] matrix as input
	â€¢	Computes and returns its eigenvalues as a REAL[10] array
	â€¢	Implements a suitable eigenvalue estimation algorithm (e.g., Power Method or simplified QR iteration)
	â€¢	Includes detailed comments within the code to explain each step of the process
	â€¢	Optimizes execution for PLC performance, ensuring the algorithm runs efficiently within real-time constraints
	â€¢	Accounts for issues such as:
	â€¢	Numerical stability (e.g., normalization, underflow/overflow)
	â€¢	Convergence control (e.g., iteration limits, thresholds)
	â€¢	Fallback behavior in case of non-convergence or timeout

Additionally, describe how eigenvalue analysis is relevant in industrial applications such as system modeling, vibration detection, and control tuning.
