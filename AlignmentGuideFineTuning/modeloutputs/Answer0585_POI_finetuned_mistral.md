### Intent:
The intent is to generate PLC logic for monitoring and controlling valve operations (ammonia and CO2) while ensuring system stability by checking pressure and temperature sensor readings against predefined thresholds.

### Prompt:
**Learning IEC 61499:**

Provide a concise introduction to the IEC 61499 programming language, emphasizing key concepts for someone already familiar with IEC 61131-3. Include a comparison of their fundamental differences in terms of architecture, execution models, and flexibility for distributed control systems. Additionally, compile a list of five key references for further reading on IEC 61499, highlighting its relevance in modern industrial applications.

**R-I-S-E:**

🟥 R (Role) – Your Role

You are a control systems engineer who is already experienced with IEC 61131-3 and looking to expand your expertise to include IEC 61499, which is becoming increasingly important in distributed and Industry 4.0 automation systems.

⸻

🟩 I (Input) – What You’re Given

You are asked to write a concise introduction to IEC 61499 that:
	•	Targets professionals familiar with IEC 61131-3
	•	Explains key concepts such as event-driven function blocks, distribution, and reusability
	•	Includes a comparison between IEC 61131-3 and IEC 61499 regarding:
	•	Architecture
	•	Execution models
	•	Flexibility for distributed control
	•	Compiles five essential references for further reading on IEC 61499’s theory and industrial applications

⸻

🟧 S (Steps) – How to Complete the Task
	1.	Introduce IEC 61499 briefly: describe its origin and purpose
	2.	Explain key concepts:
	•	Function blocks (basic, composite, service interface)
	•	Event-data separation
	•	Event-driven execution model
	•	Distribution across networked devices
	3.	Compare with IEC 61131-3:
	•	Centralized (61131-3) vs. Distributed (61499)
	•	Scan-based execution vs. Event-driven triggering
	•	Portability and reuse of function blocks
	4.	List five high-quality references:
	•	Standards documentation
	•	Academic papers or textbooks
	•	Technical blogs or white papers
	5.	Conclude with a brief summary of how IEC 61499 supports flexible, modern industrial control

⸻

🟦 E (Expectation) – What You Will Deliver

A concise, professional-level technical overview that:
	•	Helps IEC 61131-3 users quickly understand and position IEC 61499
	•	Clearly contrasts architectural and execution philosophies
	•	Provides a roadmap for deeper study via key references
	•	Serves as a useful onboarding guide or training material in smart manufacturing or IIoT contexts

### Generated Code:
