### Intent:
**Intent Summary:**  
Develop a Modbus TCP server function block in IEC 61131-3 Structured Text that supports 10 parallel client connections and implements key Modbus functions (including ReadCoils), with robust request handling, TCP/IP management, and diagnostic outputs.  

*(Focus: Concurrency, protocol compliance, and communication reliability.)*

### Prompt:
**Modbus Server for Parallel Client Connections using 61131-3 Structured Text:**

Develop a self-contained 61131-3 structured text function block to implement a Modbus server capable of handling up to 10 parallel client connection requests over Modbus TCP. The server should manage Modbus requests within data ranges that map input and holding registers. The following Modbus function codes must be supported:

	•	0x01: Read Coils
	•	0x02: Read Discrete Inputs
	•	0x03: Read Holding Registers
	•	0x04: Read Input Registers
	•	0x05: Write Single Coil
	•	0x06: Write Single Register
	•	0x0F: Write Multiple Coils
	•	0x10: Write Multiple Registers
	•	0x17: Read/Write Multiple Registers

In addition, describe the ReadCoils method, explaining how it processes client requests, maps coil data, and manages communication over TCP/IP.

🟥 R (Role) – Your Role

Act as a PLC software engineer developing advanced communication interfaces using IEC 61131-3 Structured Text for Modbus TCP networking.

⸻

🟩 T (Task) – What You Need to Do

Create a self-contained function block that implements a Modbus TCP server capable of handling up to 10 parallel client connections. The server must support the following Modbus function codes:
	•	0x01: Read Coils
	•	0x02: Read Discrete Inputs
