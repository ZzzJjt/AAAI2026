### Intent:
The task is to create an IEC 61131-3 structured text function block that establishes an OPC UA subscription by interfacing with external C-code, handling subscription parameters, error checking, and lifecycle management for real-time industrial data monitoring.

### Prompt:
**Ethernet PowerLink Diagnostics Using IEC 61131-3 Structured Text:**

Develop a function block in structured text (ST) based on IEC 61131 standards to retrieve Ethernet PowerLink diagnostic information from a control node device via a PowerLink managing node (MN). The function block should collect and display key diagnostic data such as communication status, error codes, and node health. The program must ensure that the diagnostic information is accurately processed and relayed to the controller for further analysis. Discuss how the function block interacts with the PowerLink network, handles error detection, and provides real-time diagnostics for maintaining network integrity.

**B-A-B:**

ðŸŸ¥ B (Before) â€“ The Challenge

In Ethernet PowerLink-based industrial networks, monitoring communication health is critical. However, without a dedicated diagnostic function, retrieving and interpreting diagnostic dataâ€”such as error codes, communication failures, or node statusâ€”can be difficult, delayed, and error-prone. This lack of real-time visibility makes troubleshooting and network maintenance inefficient.

ðŸŸ© A (After) â€“ The Ideal Outcome

Develop a Structured Text (ST) function block, compliant with IEC 61131 standards, that communicates with a PowerLink Managing Node (MN) to retrieve diagnostic data from connected control nodes. The function block should provide real-time access to key information such as communication status, error codes, and node health, making it available to the controller for analysis and system-level decision-making.

ðŸŸ§ B (Bridge) â€“ The Implementation Strategy

Design the function block to interface with the PowerLink MN using defined service or diagnostic channels. Implement logic to cyclically poll diagnostic registers, parse status codes, and identify node-level issues such as timeouts, offline states, or internal faults. Include mechanisms for error detection and structured output formatting, so that the controller or operator interface can clearly display the health of each nodeâ€”supporting quick diagnostics, faster fault resolution, and improved network reliability.
