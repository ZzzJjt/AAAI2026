### Intent:
**Intent Summary:**  
Develop an IEC 61131-3 Structured Text function block to reliably read and validate five process values from an IO-Link master, with robust error handling and status reporting for communication integrity.  

*(Focus: IO-Link data acquisition, error management, real-time diagnostics in industrial control systems.)*

### Prompt:
**IO-Link Data Acquisition Using 61131-3 Structured Text:**

Develop a function block in structured text (ST) based on IEC 61131 standards to read five values from a remote IO-Link master. The function block should handle communication with the IO-Link master, retrieve the required process data, and provide the status of each read operation. Discuss the methodology used for error checking, status reporting, and handling of potential communication issues between the IO-Link master and the connected devices.

**T-A-G:**

ðŸŸ¥ T (Task) â€“ What You Need to Do

Develop an IEC 61131-3 Structured Text (ST) function block to acquire five process values from a remote IO-Link master device.

ðŸŸ© A (Action) â€“ How to Do It

Implement logic to establish and manage communication with the IO-Link master. Sequentially or concurrently read five data points, verify the integrity of each response, and return both the values and their respective status indicators. Integrate error detection and reporting mechanisms to handle communication issues, such as timeouts or data corruption.

ðŸŸ¦ G (Goal) â€“ What You Want to Achieve

Ensure accurate and reliable acquisition of IO-Link data, with clear status feedback for each value, enabling the controller to act on real-time diagnostics and maintain robust system behavior even in the presence of communication faults.

Ensure accurate and reliable acquisition of IO-Link data, with clear status feedback for each value, enabling the controller to act on real-time diagnostics and maintain robust system behavior even in the presence of communication faults. 

**Methodology:**

1. **Establishing Communication:**
   - Use the IO-Link library or built-in functions to establish a connection with the IO-Link master.
   - Implement a timeout mechanism to handle communication failures and ensure the function block does not get stuck in a loop.

2. **Data Acquisition:**
   - Define a data structure to hold the five process values and their status indicators.
   - Use the IO-Link library or built-in functions to read the required data points from the master.
   - Verify the integrity of each response by checking the CRC or other error detection mechanisms provided by the IO-Link protocol.

3. **Error Handling and Status Reporting:**
   - Implement a mechanism to report the status of each read operation, such as success or failure.
   - Use structured text's built-in error handling mechanisms to manage exceptions and handle communication issues.
   - Provide clear and informative error messages to aid in troubleshooting and system maintenance.

4. **Real-Time Diagnostics:**
   - Integrate the function block into a larger control system, where the acquired data can be used for real-time diagnostics and decision-making.
   - Monitor the status indicators returned by the function block to detect and respond to communication issues promptly.

**Example Code:**

```ST
// Define the data structure for process values and status indicators
type
  TProcessValues is record
    Value1: Real;
    Value2: Real;
    Value3: Real;
    Value4: Real;
    Value5: Real;
    Status1: Boolean;
    Status2: Boolean;
    Status3: Boolean;
    Status4: Boolean;
    Status5: Boolean;
  end record;

// Function block to read process values from IO-Link master
function ReadProcessValues: TProcessValues;
begin
  // Establish communication with the IO-Link master
  if not EstablishConnection() then
    begin
      // Handle communication failure
      ReadProcessValues.Status1 := False;
      ReadProcessValues.Status2 := False;
      ReadProcessValues.Status3 := False;
      ReadProcessValues.Status4 := False;
      ReadProcessValues.Status5 := False;
      exit;
    end;

  // Read process values from the IO-Link master
  Value1 := ReadValue1();
  Value2 := ReadValue2();
  Value3 := ReadValue3();
  Value4 := ReadValue4();
  Value5 := ReadValue5();

  // Verify integrity of each response
