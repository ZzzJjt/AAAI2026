### Intent:
**Intent Summary:**  
Create a reusable IEC 61131-3 function block to compare two REAL numbers with configurable decimal precision, outputting equality/greater/less flags and handling invalid inputs, for reliable floating-point comparisons in PLC applications.  

*(Focus: Precision-controlled comparison, error handling, modularity)*

### Prompt:
**Real Comparator:**
Implement a self-contained function block in IEC 61131-3 structured text to compare two real inputs up to n decimal places. Include configurable precision and error handling.


**T-A-G:**

ðŸŸ¥ T (Task)

Create a self-contained function block in IEC 61131-3 Structured Text to compare two REAL numbers with precision control up to a user-defined number of decimal places.

â¸»

ðŸŸ© A (Action)
	â€¢	Accept the following inputs:
	â€¢	Input1 : REAL
	â€¢	Input2 : REAL
	â€¢	Precision : INT â€“ number of decimal places for comparison
	â€¢	Enable : BOOL â€“ triggers execution
	â€¢	Internally calculate a scaling factor:
\text{Scale} := 10^{\text{Precision}}
	â€¢	Multiply each input by Scale, round the results, and convert them to integers
	â€¢	Compare the two values and set the appropriate output flags:
	â€¢	Equal : BOOL
	â€¢	Greater : BOOL
	â€¢	Less : BOOL
	â€¢	Error : BOOL (if Precision < 0 or Enable = FALSE)
	â€¢	Ensure the logic is modular, scan-cycle safe, and easily reusable

ðŸŸ¦ G (Goal)

Deliver a robust and reusable real-number comparator function block that reliably handles floating-point comparisons with configurable precision. This will improve accuracy and reliability in PLC-based control applications involving setpoint verification, sensor thresholds, and quality control decisions.
