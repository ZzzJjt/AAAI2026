# ðŸ“‹ Problem Definition
# 
# ðŸ”¹ Objective
# 
# Develop an MPC controller in Python to optimize the two-stage batch process of a chemical production system.
# The controller must maintain stable tank levels while responding to fluctuating demand forecasts.
# 
# ðŸ”¸ Constraints
# 
#  â€¢	The system operates in a discrete-time environment with a 1-hour sampling interval.
#  â€¢	The process consists of two tanks: Tank 1 (T1) and Tank 2 (T2).
#  â€¢	Tank 1 is filled from an external source at a constant rate of 100 L/h.
#  â€¢	Tank 2 is filled from Tank 1 at a rate proportional to the level difference between the two tanks.
#  â€¢	The demand forecast is a step function with three demand levels: 0, 50, and 100 L/h.
#  â€¢	The control input is the valve opening to Tank 2, which must be between 0 and 100%.
#  â€¢	The system has a 2-hour time delay due to transport delays.
