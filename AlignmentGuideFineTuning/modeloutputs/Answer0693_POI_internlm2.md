### Intent:
**Intent Summary:**  
Develop a structured control narrative for an ethanol fermentation process, specifying setpoints, control logic, alarms, and interlocks for temperature, pH, agitation, and inoculation to ensure automated, safe, and efficient production.  

*(Focus: Clear, actionable guidance for automation design and operator training.)*

### Prompt:
**Control Narrative for Ethanol Production**

Create a control narrative for ethanol production including concrete setpoints and ranges.

Create a detailed explanation of each control step during Fermentation. Create one paragraph per subsection in Section 3.


**R-I-S-E:**

🟥 R (Role) – Define Your Role

Act as a process control engineer developing a detailed and structured control narrative for an ethanol production system, with a focus on the fermentation phase.

⸻

🟩 I (Input) – Information Provided

You are asked to:
	•	Create a control narrative for the overall ethanol production process, including concrete setpoints and control ranges for critical parameters.
	•	Focus particularly on Section 3: Fermentation, which should be broken down into multiple subsections (e.g., temperature control, pH regulation, inoculation, agitation).
	•	For each subsection, write one paragraph explaining the control logic, target setpoints, equipment used, and any interlocks or alarms.

⸻

🟧 S (Steps) – Steps to Perform
	1.	Define key control variables and parameters for the fermentation process:
	•	Temperature: e.g., 32–35°C
	•	pH: e.g., 4.5–5.0
	•	Agitation speed: e.g., 100–150 RPM
	2.	Break Section 3 into logical control topics such as:
	•	3.1 Inoculation Control
	•	3.2 Temperature Regulation
	•	3.3 pH Control
	•	3.4 Agitation/Mixing
	•	3.5 Foam Control
	3.	For each subsection, describe the control objective, specific control ranges/setpoints, and how each is managed using automation tools or manual intervention.
	4.	Include details on alarms, interlocks, and safety considerations for deviations.
	5.	Ensure clarity and standard format so it can be used in automation design, HMI programming, and operator training.

⸻

🟦 E (Expectation) – Expected Outcome

Deliver a clear, structured, and technically accurate control narrative for the ethanol fermentation process. The document should help guide automation engineers, plant operators, and regulatory reviewers in understanding:
	•	What is controlled
	•	Why it is controlled
	•	How it is controlled
	•	What happens when setpoints are violated

Each paragraph should act as a standalone reference for implementation or troubleshooting.
