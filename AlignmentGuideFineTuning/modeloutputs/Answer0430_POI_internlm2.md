### Intent:
The task involves developing a Model Predictive Control (MPC) system in MATLAB to optimize an aircraft's 2D longitudinal trajectory by adjusting thrust and elevator inputs while maintaining altitude and handling wind disturbances, with numerical performance outputs.

### Prompt:
**Statistical Process Control for Steel Manufacturing Using Python:**

Develop Python code to implement a statistical process control (SPC) system for monitoring and optimizing the quality of steel manufacturing processes. The code should track key quality metrics such as tensile strength, thickness, and surface finish in real-time, using control charts and other SPC tools to detect and respond to process variations. Implement alarms for out-of-control conditions, and suggest corrective actions to minimize defects and ensure product consistency.

Simulate the steel manufacturing process, and demonstrate how SPC can be used to maintain high-quality production standards while minimizing waste and process variability.
