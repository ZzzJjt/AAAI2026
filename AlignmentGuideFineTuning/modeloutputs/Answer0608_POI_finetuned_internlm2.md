END_LOOP; END_PROGRAM

Consider that the program is executed cyclically in a task according to the 61131-3 programming model. Thus no explicit main loop is needed. Please fix the code by removing the 'LOOP'.

**R-I-S-E:**

ðŸŸ¥ R (Role â€“ Who You Are)

You are a PLC engineer or control systems programmer responsible for maintaining and improving IEC 61131-3-based batch control logic for a polyethylene production process.

â¸»

ðŸŸ© I (Input â€“ What You Have)

You are given a Structured Text program that:
	â€¢	Controls a multi-step batch process (raw material prep â†’ polymerization â†’ quenching â†’ drying â†’ pelletizing â†’ QA â†’ packaging)
	â€¢	Uses a state variable and a TON timer for step durations
	â€¢	Incorrectly contains a LOOP, despite the code being executed cyclically in a PLC scan cycle
	â€¢	Repeats temperature and pressure setting logic with minimal abstraction

â¸»

ðŸŸ§ S (Steps â€“ What You Need to Do)
	1.	Remove the LOOP: Replace it with cyclic logic conforming to the 61131-3 scan model.
	2.	Refactor repeated logic: Create or improve a method such as UpdateTemperaturesAndPressures() to centralize condition setting per state.
	3.	Standardize timer usage: Ensure each state:
	â€¢	Initializes the timer on entry
	â€¢	Evaluates timer.Q for completion
	â€¢	Resets timer.IN and advances state properly
	4.	Improve structure and readability:
	â€¢	Align comments and formatting
	â€¢	Optionally extract each batch step into a function or method
	â€¢	Group process parameters and state logic clearly

â¸»

ðŸŸ¦ E (Expectation â€“ What Success Looks Like)

A properly optimized program will:
	â€¢	Comply with best practices of IEC 61131-3 (no LOOP, cyclic logic only)
	â€¢	Be easier to read, maintain, and scale (e.g., adding steps or changing durations)
	â€¢	Reliably advance batch steps using timers
	â€¢	Promote reuse and modularity, such as methods for setting process conditions
	â€¢	Enable safe execution and debugging by minimizing logic duplication and state inconsistencies

**Optimize Batch Control:**

Please optimize the following batch control logic for a polyethylene production process. The logic should be structured in a self-contained method that handles the transition between each step of the process. The method should be called in a cyclic manner to control the process. The method should include the following:

â€¢	Transition logic to move between each step of the process
â€¢	Conditional logic to set the temperature and pressure for each step
â€¢	Timer logic to control the duration of each step
â€¢	State variables to track the current step of the process
â€¢	Conditional logic to trigger the next step of the process when the timer expires
