### Prompt:
**Spline Interpolation:**

Develop a self-contained function block in IEC 61131-3 Structured Text to compute spline interpolation over a set of data points.

🟥 T (Task) – What You Need to Do

🟩 A (Action) – How to Do It
	1.	Define a function block called SplineInterpolator with:
	•	Inputs:
	•	X : ARRAY[1..N] OF REAL – known x-values
	•	Y : ARRAY[1..N] OF REAL – corresponding y-values
	•	TargetX : REAL – the x-value at which to interpolate
	•	Output:
	•	InterpolatedY : REAL – the result of spline interpolation
	2.	Implement logic to perform cubic spline interpolation:
	•	Identify the correct interval for TargetX between X[i] and X[i+1]
	•	Use precomputed spline coefficients (A[i], B[i], C[i], D[i]) to evaluate:
InterpolatedY = A[i] + B[i](x - X[i]) + C[i](x - X[i])^2 + D[i](x - X[i])^3
	3.	Ensure the implementation is modular:
	•	Coefficients may be computed externally and passed in or initialized once
	•	Runtime logic is optimized for real-time scan cycles
	•	Add comments explaining the math and implementation decisions
	4.	Address challenges:
	•	Handle boundary conditions and extrapolation safely
	•	Use efficient logic for indexing and evaluating the correct segment
	•	Maintain precision without excessive memory or processing overhead

⸻

🟦 G (Goal) – What You Want to Achieve

Deliver a robust and efficient interpolation function block that:
	•	Outputs a smooth curve through all given data points
	•	Is ideal for applications such as:
	•	Motion trajectory planning
	•	Sensor data smoothing
	•	Profile-driven process control
	•	Operates predictably and safely within PLC real-time constraints
	•	Is reusable and adaptable to different array sizes and system needs

**Notes:**

*	Cubic spline interpolation is a popular choice for real-time applications due to its smoothness and ability to handle edge cases efficiently.
*	Ensure that the function block is compatible with the target PLC system and adheres to the IEC 61131-3 standard.
*	Consider using a library or external function to compute the spline coefficients if available, or implement the de Boor's algorithm for efficient computation.
*	Optimize the function block for real-time performance by minimizing memory usage and processing time.
*	Test the function block thoroughly with various input data sets to ensure accuracy and robustness.
*	Consider adding additional features, such as error handling, user-defined order of the spline, or support for different types of splines (e.g., natural, periodic).
*	Document the function block clearly, including any assumptions, limitations, and best practices for usage.
*	Consider sharing the function block with the community to help others and receive feedback.
