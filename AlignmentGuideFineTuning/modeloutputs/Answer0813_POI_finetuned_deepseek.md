### Intent:
**Intent Summary:**  
Develop a Python class to model a chemical reactor's temperature and pressure dynamics with disturbance inputs, implementing core equations for simulation without visualization.

### Prompt:
**MATLAB Distillation Column Modeling and Control:**

Develop MATLAB code for a mathematical model of a distillation column, capturing its dynamic relationships between feed rates and temperature. Avoid plotting results.
Implement a model predictive control (MPC) scheme using the developed model to optimize the distillation process while considering operational constraints.

**T-A-G:**

ðŸŸ¥ Tï¼ˆTaskï¼‰

Create a MATLAB-based dynamic model of a distillation column and apply model predictive control (MPC) to optimize its operation.

ðŸŸ© Aï¼ˆActionï¼‰

Develop a mathematical representation that captures the relationship between feed rates and temperature without plotting the results. Then, implement an MPC algorithm using the model to compute optimal control actions while respecting system constraints.

ðŸŸ¦ Gï¼ˆGoalï¼‰

Ensure the distillation column operates efficiently and within defined operational limits by using predictive control to maintain stability and optimize performance, all in a code-only, non-graphical simulation environment.
