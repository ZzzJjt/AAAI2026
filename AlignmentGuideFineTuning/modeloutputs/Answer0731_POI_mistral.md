**Notes:**

1.	For the sake of simplicity, this example will focus on the Power Method for eigenvalue estimation. However, you are encouraged to explore alternative methods such as the QR iteration or Jacobi method for more robust results.
2.	Remember to consider the specific PLC you are working with when optimizing the code for performance. Different PLCs may have varying capabilities and limitations.
3.	Ensure that the function block is designed to handle both symmetric and non-symmetric matrices.
4.	Consider using a standardized format for matrix representation (e.g., row-major order) to simplify the implementation and improve compatibility with other systems.
5.	Include a mechanism to check for matrix singularity or ill-conditioning, and provide a fallback behavior if such cases occur.
6.	Consider implementing a timeout mechanism to prevent the function block from running indefinitely in case of convergence issues.
7.	Ensure that the function block is designed to handle real-time constraints, as the eigenvalue calculation may take a significant amount of time depending on the matrix and the chosen algorithm.
8.	Consider providing an optional input parameter to specify the desired level of precision for the eigenvalues, allowing users to balance computational efficiency and accuracy according to their needs.
9.	Consider providing an optional input parameter to specify the maximum number of iterations, allowing users to balance convergence speed and computational efficiency according to their needs.
10.	Consider providing an optional input parameter to specify a tolerance threshold for convergence, allowing users to balance convergence speed and accuracy according to their needs.
11.	Consider providing an optional input parameter to specify a maximum allowed time for the function block to run, allowing users to balance real-time constraints and computational efficiency according to their needs.
12.	Consider providing an optional input parameter to specify a fallback behavior in case of non-convergence or timeout, such as returning a default set of eigenvalues or raising an error flag.
13.	Consider providing an optional input parameter to specify a normalization factor for the matrix, allowing users to balance numerical stability and accuracy according to their needs.
14.	Consider providing an optional input parameter to specify a scaling factor for the eigenvalues, allowing users to balance numerical stability and accuracy according to their needs.
