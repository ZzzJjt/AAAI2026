ðŸŸ© A (Action) â€“ How It Works
	1.	Inputs:
	â€¢	SP (Setpoint): The desired target value of the process (e.g., 75Â°C).
	â€¢	PV (Process Variable): The actual measured value (e.g., current temperature).
	â€¢	Kp, Ki, Kd: Tuning constants that define proportional, integral, and derivative behavior.
	â€¢	Optional: MANUAL mode for overriding automatic control, and LIMIT_HI / LIMIT_LO for output clamping.
	2.	Processing:
	â€¢	Computes Error := SP - PV.
	â€¢	Calculates:
	â€¢	Proportional Term: Kp * error
	â€¢	Integral Term: Ki * âˆ« error dt (to remove steady-state offset)
	â€¢	Derivative Term: Kd * d(error)/dt (to dampen sudden changes)
	â€¢	Combines these to form the control signal (OUT), with output limiting and anti-windup protection.
	3.	Outputs:
	â€¢	OUT: The control signal to the actuator (e.g., valve position, motor speed).
	â€¢	ERROR: Real-time deviation between SP and PV.
	â€¢	Status flags: Such as saturation indicators (if limits are reached).

**P (Process) â€“ How to Implement PID Control in OSCAT:**

1.	**PID Inputs:**
	â€¢	Define the setpoint (SP) and process variable (PV) for the control loop.
	â€¢	Adjust the proportional (Kp), integral (Ki), and derivative (Kd) gains to suit the specific process dynamics.
	â€¢	Optionally, set manual mode (MANUAL) to override automatic control, and define high/low limits (LIMIT_HI/LIMIT_LO) to prevent actuator saturation.

2.	**PID Processing:**
	â€¢	Compute the error between the setpoint and the process variable.
	â€¢	Apply the proportional, integral, and derivative terms to the error, generating a control signal (OUT).
	â€¢	Ensure the output is within safe limits, and apply anti-windup protection to prevent instability.

3.	**PID Outputs:**
	â€¢	Provide the control signal (OUT) to the actuator, which adjusts the process variable to match the setpoint.
	â€¢	Display the real-time error (ERROR) to monitor control performance.
	â€¢	Indicate any saturation or mode-switching events to facilitate troubleshooting.
