ðŸŸ¥ T (Task)

Design a self-contained Kalman filter function block in IEC 61131-3 Structured Text to estimate the position and velocity of an autonomous transport vehicle using noisy sensor input.

ðŸŸ© A (Action)
	â€¢	Implement a discrete-time, 2-state Kalman filter using only scalar arithmetic, avoiding matrix operations or recursion
	â€¢	Accept configurable inputs:
	â€¢	MeasuredPosition : REAL
	â€¢	Q : REAL â€“ process noise covariance
	â€¢	R : REAL â€“ measurement noise covariance
	â€¢	DeltaT : REAL â€“ sample time
	â€¢	Reset : BOOL â€“ to reinitialize state
	â€¢	Internally manage variables for:
	â€¢	Estimated position and velocity
	â€¢	Previous position (for velocity update)
	â€¢	Error covariance and Kalman gain
	â€¢	Perform prediction and update steps each scan cycle
	â€¢	Add clear comments for each stage of the algorithm to support maintainability and clarity

ðŸŸ¦ G (Goal)

Deliver a modular, scan-cycle-safe function block that produces reliable estimates of position and velocity despite measurement noise. The block should be easy to configure, integrate into motion control logic, and adaptable for various autonomous or mobile platform applications.

ðŸŸ¦ G (Goal)

Deliver a modular, scan-cycle-safe function block that produces reliable estimates of position and velocity despite measurement noise. The block should be easy to configure, integrate into motion control logic, and adaptable for various autonomous or mobile platform applications. 

**Example Use Case:**
In a motion control system for an autonomous vehicle, the Kalman filter block receives noisy position measurements from an encoder and uses the Kalman filter to estimate the vehicle's true position and velocity. The estimated values are then used to control the vehicle's motion, ensuring smooth and accurate navigation.

**Note:**
This task is designed to be a standalone, self-contained function block that can be easily integrated into larger control systems. It is intended to be a practical example of how to implement a Kalman filter in a real-world industrial setting, using the IEC 61131-3 standard for structured text programming. The focus is on clarity, maintainability, and industrial applicability, rather than on the mathematical intricacies of the Kalman filter algorithm.
