### Prompt:
**Fuzzy Logic Control for Chemical Reactor Optimization Using Python:**

Develop Python code to implement a fuzzy logic control system for optimizing the operation of a chemical reactor. The control system should manage key reactor variables such as temperature, pressure, and reaction rate, considering the nonlinear and uncertain nature of the reactorâ€™s dynamics. Fuzzy logic should be applied to handle imprecise inputs and adjust control actions in real-time to maintain optimal reactor performance under varying operating conditions.

Implement Python code to simulate the chemical reactorâ€™s dynamics, demonstrating how fuzzy logic control can provide robust and adaptive responses to system uncertainties and process variations.

**C-A-R-E:**

ðŸŸ¥ Cï¼ˆContextï¼‰

Chemical reactors often operate under nonlinear and uncertain conditions, where precise modeling is difficult. Traditional control systems may fail to maintain optimal performance when inputs are imprecise or when the process environment changes dynamically.

ðŸŸ© Aï¼ˆActionï¼‰

Develop Python code to implement a fuzzy logic control system that can effectively regulate key reactor variables such as temperature, pressure, and reaction rate. Design fuzzy rules and membership functions to manage uncertainty and adapt control actions in real time.

ðŸŸ¨ Rï¼ˆResultï¼‰

The fuzzy logic controller should demonstrate improved robustness, flexibility, and adaptability compared to conventional controllers, ensuring stable and optimal reactor operation under a wide range of process conditions.

ðŸŸ¦ Eï¼ˆExampleï¼‰

Simulate a scenario where the reactor experiences sudden pressure fluctuations or uncertain temperature readings. Use the fuzzy logic system to show how it adjusts control actions smoothly and maintains performance, while a traditional controller might overreact or become unstable.

Fuzzy logic control offers several benefits for chemical reactor optimization:

1. **Adaptive control**: Fuzzy logic can handle imprecise inputs and adjust control actions in real time, adapting to changing process conditions.
2. **Robustness**: Fuzzy logic controllers can provide more robust responses to disturbances and uncertainties, reducing the risk of instability or overshoot.
3. **Flexibility**: Fuzzy rules can be easily modified or updated, allowing for quick adaptation to new operating scenarios or process requirements.

**E-valuation:**

Evaluate the performance of the fuzzy logic controller against a traditional controller by comparing key performance indicators (KPIs) such as:

- **Response time**: The time taken by the controller to adjust the control actions in response to a disturbance.
- **Overshoot**: The extent to which the controlled variable exceeds the desired setpoint after a
