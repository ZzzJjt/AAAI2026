### Intent:
**Intent Summary:**  
Develop a Python-based fuzzy logic control system to regulate temperature and pressure in a chemical reactor, using `skfuzzy` to handle nonlinear dynamics and disturbances, and visualize the control response.

### Prompt:
**Artificial Neural Network Control for Temperature Regulation in a Chemical Reactor Using Python:**

**Origin**

Develop Python code to implement an artificial neural network (ANN) for advanced process control of the temperature in a chemical reactor. The control system should leverage the predictive and adaptive capabilities of ANNs to manage the reactorâ€™s temperature, considering the nonlinear and time-varying nature of the reactorâ€™s dynamics. Train the ANN using historical process data to optimize temperature control, ensuring stability and efficiency under varying operational conditions.

Implement Python code to simulate the chemical reactorâ€™s temperature control dynamics and demonstrate how ANN-based control can outperform traditional methods in handling complex, nonlinear systems.

**C-A-R-E**

ðŸŸ¥ Cï¼ˆContextï¼‰

In chemical process industries, temperature control of reactors is critical. However, due to the nonlinear and time-varying nature of reactor dynamics, traditional PID controllers often fall short in maintaining optimal performance.

ðŸŸ© Aï¼ˆActionï¼‰

Develop Python code to implement an artificial neural network (ANN)-based advanced process control system. Train the ANN using historical process data to predict and adjust temperature more effectively than conventional methods. Also, simulate the reactorâ€™s temperature dynamics to validate control performance.

ðŸŸ¨ Rï¼ˆResultï¼‰

The ANN controller should demonstrate superior adaptability and predictive accuracy, resulting in more stable temperature control, improved energy efficiency, and reduced oscillations compared to traditional PID-based approaches.

ðŸŸ¦ Eï¼ˆExampleï¼‰

For instance, simulate a scenario where the reactor experiences a sudden change in feed temperature. Show how the ANN anticipates and adjusts the control signal smoothly, while the PID controller lags or causes instability.

**Steps**

1. Import required libraries, including `numpy`, `matplotlib`, `skfuzzy`, and `sklearn`.
2. Define the reactor model, including nonlinear dynamics and disturbances.
3. Prepare historical process data, including temperature, feed temperature, and control signal.
4. Design and train the ANN using the prepared data, optimizing for temperature control.
5. Implement the ANN controller in a control loop, integrating it with the reactor model.
6. Simulate the reactorâ€™s temperature dynamics under various conditions, comparing the performance of the ANN controller with a traditional PID controller.
7. Visualize the control response, including temperature profiles, control signals, and performance metrics.

```python
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from skfuzzy import control as ctrl
from sklearn.neural_network import MLPRegressor

# Define reactor model
def reactor_model(t, x, u):
    A, B, C = 1, 0.1, 0.5
    T_in, T_0 = x[0], x[1]
    u_prev = u[-1]

    dT_dt = A * (T_in - T_0) - B * T_0 * np.exp(-C * t) + u_prev
    return dT_dt

# Prepare historical data
t = np.linspace(0, 100, 1000)
T_in = np.sin(t) + 30
T_0 = 25
u = np.zeros(len(t))

# Train ANN
X = np.array([t.reshape(-1, 1), T_in.reshape(-1, 1)]).T
y = u

nn = MLPRegressor(hidden_layer_sizes=(100, 50), max_iter=1000)
nn.fit(X, y)

# Define fuzzy controller
controller = ctrl.Antecedent(np.arange(-1, 1, 0.1), 'u')
