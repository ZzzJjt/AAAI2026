### Prompt:
**Model Predictive Control for HVAC System Optimization Using C++:**

Develop C++ code to implement a model predictive control (MPC) algorithm for optimizing the performance of a Heating, Ventilation, and Air Conditioning (HVAC) system. The control system should manage temperature, humidity, and energy consumption while maintaining occupant comfort. It must consider dynamic constraints such as varying external temperatures, occupancy levels, and energy efficiency requirements, ensuring optimal control under changing environmental conditions.

Implement C++ code to simulate the HVAC systemâ€™s dynamics, and demonstrate how MPC can optimize energy usage, response time, and system performance while adhering to operational constraints.

ðŸŸ¥ Cï¼ˆContextï¼‰

Heating, Ventilation, and Air Conditioning (HVAC) systems are essential for maintaining occupant comfort in buildings, but traditional control methods often fail to optimize energy consumption while maintaining comfort. These methods do not account for dynamic environmental changes, such as fluctuating external temperatures or varying occupancy levels, leading to inefficient energy use and delayed system responses.

ðŸŸ© Aï¼ˆActionï¼‰

Develop C++ code to implement a model predictive control (MPC) algorithm that optimizes HVAC performance. The algorithm should manage temperature, humidity, and energy consumption by forecasting future conditions and adjusting control inputs accordingly, while considering dynamic constraints like external temperature, occupancy, and energy efficiency requirements.

ðŸŸ¨ Rï¼ˆResultï¼‰

The MPC-based HVAC control system should significantly reduce energy consumption while maintaining comfort levels. It should demonstrate the ability to respond quickly to environmental changes, minimize delays in achieving desired temperature and humidity levels, and ensure optimal energy efficiency under varying operational conditions.

ðŸŸ¦ Eï¼ˆExampleï¼‰

For example, if the system detects an increase in occupancy and an external temperature rise, the MPC controller would proactively adjust HVAC settings to maintain comfort while minimizing energy usage, compared to a traditional control method that would react only after these changes are detected.

**C++ Implementation:**

Write a C++ function that implements a model predictive control (MPC) algorithm for an HVAC system. The function should take as input the current state of the system (temperature, humidity, and energy consumption), as well as the desired setpoints and constraints (e.g., maximum allowable energy usage). The function should then calculate the optimal control inputs (e.g., fan speed, heating/cooling power) for the next time step, considering the system dynamics and constraints. The output should include the calculated control inputs and the predicted system state for the next time step.

**C++ Code:**

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <cmath>

struct HVACState {
    double temperature;
    double humidity;
    double energyConsumption;
};

struct HVACSetpoint {
    double temperatureSetpoint;
    double humiditySetpoint;
    double energySetpoint;
};

struct HVACConstraint {
    double maxEnergyConsumption;
    double minTemperature;
    double maxTemperature;
    double minHumidity;
    double maxHumidity;
};

struct HVACControlInput {
    double fanSpeed;
    double heatingPower;
    double coolingPower;
};

HVACControlInput MPCControl(const HVACState& currentState, const HVACSetpoint& setpoint, const HVACConstraint& constraints) {
    // Implement the MPC algorithm here, considering the system dynamics and constraints.
    // Calculate the optimal control inputs (fan speed, heating/cooling power) for the next time step.
    // Return the calculated control inputs.
}

int main() {
    HVACState currentState = { 25.0, 50.0, 100.0 };
    HVACSetpoint setpoint = { 24.0, 50.0, 80.0 };
    HVACConstraint constraints = { 120.0, 18.0, 30.0, 30.0, 70.0 };

    HVACControlInput controlInput = MPCControl(currentState, setpoint, constraints);

    // Use the calculated control inputs to update the HVAC system.
    // ...

    return 0;
}
```

**C++ Implementation Details:**

Implement the MPC algorithm in the `MPCControl` function, considering the system dynamics and constraints.
