### Intent:
**Intent Summary:**  
Generate a 30-entry I/O list table for a steel rolling mill, including signal names, types, ranges, setpoints, and P&ID references, to standardize control system documentation and integration.  

**Code-Generation Intent:**  
*"Create a structured I/O list table with 30 entries for a rolling millâ€™s control system, covering analog/digital signals, engineering units, ranges, setpoints, and P&ID links."*

### Prompt:
**IO List Rolling Mill:**

Create an I/O list as a table with 30 lines for a rolling mill in a steel production plant. Have as columns signal name, input/output, signal tagnumber, analog/digital, engineering unit, ranges, setpoint, and P&ID reference.

**T-A-G:**

ðŸŸ¥ T (Task)

Develop a detailed I/O list table with 30 entries for a rolling mill in a steel production plant.

â¸»

ðŸŸ© A (Action)
	â€¢	Create a table with the following columns:
	â€¢	Signal Name
	â€¢	Input/Output
	â€¢	Signal Tagnumber
	â€¢	Analog/Digital
	â€¢	Engineering Unit
	â€¢	Range
	â€¢	Setpoint
	â€¢	P&ID Reference
	â€¢	Populate the table with 30 realistic signals, such as roll speed feedback, hydraulic pressure, motor current, cooling valve control, and strip tension measurement.
	â€¢	Ensure values like engineering units, ranges, and setpoints reflect typical rolling mill operations.
	â€¢	Format the list clearly for use in documentation, HMI/PLC configuration, or system integration.

â¸»

ðŸŸ¦ G (Goal)

Produce a well-structured and complete I/O list that serves as a foundational reference for control system development, instrumentation wiring, and P&ID alignmentâ€”ensuring accurate communication between automation, mechanical, and electrical engineering teams.
