### Intent:
**Intent Summary:**  
Implement a Model Predictive Control (MPC) algorithm in C++ to optimize an HVAC system's energy efficiency and occupant comfort by dynamically adjusting temperature and humidity based on predictive models and real-time environmental constraints.  

*(Focus: Code generation for MPC-driven HVAC optimization with dynamic adaptation.)*

### Prompt:
**Model Predictive Control for HVAC System Optimization Using C++:**

Develop C++ code to implement a model predictive control (MPC) algorithm for optimizing the performance of a Heating, Ventilation, and Air Conditioning (HVAC) system. The control system should manage temperature, humidity, and energy consumption while maintaining occupant comfort. It must consider dynamic constraints such as varying external temperatures, occupancy levels, and energy efficiency requirements, ensuring optimal control under changing environmental conditions.

Implement C++ code to simulate the HVAC systemâ€™s dynamics, and demonstrate how MPC can optimize energy usage, response time, and system performance while adhering to operational constraints.

**B-A-B:**

ðŸŸ¥ Bï¼ˆBeforeï¼‰

Conventional HVAC control methods often struggle to maintain occupant comfort while minimizing energy consumption, especially under fluctuating external temperatures, varying occupancy levels, and dynamic environmental conditions. These methods lack foresight and adaptability, leading to inefficient energy usage and delayed system responses.

ðŸŸ© Aï¼ˆAfterï¼‰

Use model predictive control (MPC) to implement a smart HVAC management system in C++ that proactively adjusts temperature and humidity settings. The system should optimize energy consumption and maintain occupant comfort by forecasting environmental changes and responding efficiently to dynamic constraints.

ðŸŸ§ Bï¼ˆBridgeï¼‰

Develop C++ code to simulate HVAC system dynamics, including variables like indoor temperature, humidity, occupancy, and external weather. Then, implement an MPC algorithm that continuously optimizes control decisions based on predictive models and real-time constraints, demonstrating improvements in energy efficiency, responsiveness, and environmental adaptability.
