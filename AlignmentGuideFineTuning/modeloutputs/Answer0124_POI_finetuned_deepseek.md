### Intent:
**Intent Summary:**  
Generate developer documentation for a PLC program (`UreaReactionControl`) that automates a two-step urea synthesis process by controlling ammonia/COâ‚‚ valves, monitoring pressure/temperature, and timing the reaction, with clear explanations of variables, logic flow, and safety conditions.  

*(Focus: Code understanding for maintenance/auditing, emphasizing process steps, tolerances, and valve control logic.)*

ðŸŸ¥ Before â€“ The Context or Need

You have a Structured Text (IEC 61131-3) PLC program named UreaReactionControl, which manages a two-step urea synthesis process. The code controls the opening of ammonia and COâ‚‚ valves, monitors reactor pressure and temperature, and times the reaction. However, this logic is currently undocumented, making it harder for developers, maintainers, or auditors to understand and work with the process flow.

â¸»

ðŸŸ© After â€“ The Desired Output

Generate clear, developer-oriented documentation for the UreaReactionControl program. The documentation should explain:
	â€¢	Purpose of the program
	â€¢	Function of each variable (inputs, outputs, internal, and parameters)
	â€¢	Step-by-step description of the process flow:
	â€¢	Step 1: Loading raw materials
	â€¢	Step 2: Monitoring and controlling the reaction
	â€¢	Completion: Finalizing the reaction
	â€¢	Conditions under which valves are opened or closed
	â€¢	Timing and tolerance logic for pressure and temperature
	â€¢	Use of CURRENT_TIME for reaction timing

This documentation should enable new developers or automation engineers to quickly grasp the codeâ€™s intent and implementation.

ðŸŸ¦ Bridge â€“ How to Get There

Use the provided source code and:
	1.	Describe each code section (inputs, outputs, internal variables, constants)
	2.	Explain the logic in a narrative form: What happens first? What triggers transitions?
	3.	Include conditions and logic branches, like how temperature and pressure are validated
	4.	Highlight safety logic like valve shutoff and reaction completion
	5.	Format the result in a developer manual style, optionally including a table for parameters and a step flow diagram (if needed)

Here is a detailed developer documentation for the UreaReactionControl program in IEC 61131-3 Structured Text. The documentation includes:

* Purpose: Automates a two-step urea synthesis process by controlling ammonia and COâ‚‚ valves, monitoring pressure and temperature, and timing the reaction.
* Variables:
	+ stAmmoniaValve: BOOL â€“ TRUE when ammonia valve is open
	+ stCO2Valve: BOOL â€“ TRUE when CO2 valve is open
	+ rCurrentPressure: REAL â€“ Current pressure in bars
	+ rCurrentTemperature: REAL â€“ Current temperature in ï¿½C
	+ stStep1: BOOL â€“ TRUE when ammonia and CO2 valves are open
	+ stStep2: BOOL â€“ TRUE when reaction is in progress
	+ stReactionFinished: BOOL â€“ TRUE when reaction is complete
	+ rTargetPressure: REAL â€“ Target reactor pressure in bars
	+ rPressureTolerance: REAL â€“ Pressure tolerance in bars
	+ rTargetTemperature: REAL â€“ Target reactor temperature in ï¿½C
	+ rTemperatureTolerance: REAL â€“ Temperature tolerance in ï¿½C
	+ tReactionTime: TIME â€“ Total reaction time
	+ tReactionTimer: TIME â€“ Reaction timer
* Main Sequence Control:
	1.	Step 1: Load raw materials
	â€¢	Open ammonia and COâ‚‚ valves
	â€¢	Record current time to start reaction timing
	2.	Step 2: Control reaction
	â€¢	Check if current pressure and temperature are within target range
	â€¢	Close valves if pressure or temperature is outside tolerance
	â€¢	Check if reaction time has been reached
	3.	Completion: Finalize the reaction
	â€¢	Close all valves
	â€¢	Mark reaction as finished
* Safety Logic:
	â€¢	Valves are only opened if both ammonia and COâ‚‚ are open
	â€¢	Valves are closed if pressure or temperature is outside tolerance
	â€¢	Reaction is only controlled if both valves are open and the reaction time has been reached
* Timing Logic:
	â€¢	CURRENT_TIME is used to track the time since the reaction timer was set
	â€¢	Reaction is considered complete when the timer has passed the reaction time
* Use in Automation:
	â€¢	Used in chemical process automation to control the urea synthesis process
	â€¢	Can be integrated into PLCs or H
