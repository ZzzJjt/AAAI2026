🟩 A (Action) – How to Do It
	1.	Create a function block named NaturalLog with:
	•	Input:
	•	X : REAL — the number to compute ln(X)
	•	Outputs:
	•	LnX : REAL — the result of ln(X)
	•	Error : BOOL — set to TRUE if X ≤ 0, indicating an invalid input
	2.	Implement the logic:
	•	Use the built-in LN() function for valid inputs:

 IF X > 0.0 THEN
    LnX := LN(X);
    Error := FALSE;
ELSE
    LnX := 0.0;
    Error := TRUE;
END_IF;

	•	Add inline comments explaining:
	•	ln(X) is undefined for X ≤ 0
	•	Why Error is raised for domain violations
	•	How the function is kept simple and deterministic for PLC use

	3.	Ensure compatibility and efficiency:
	•	Avoid recursion or dynamic structures
	•	Ensure all code executes predictably within a scan cycle
	•	Optionally include versioning or diagnostic codes for system integration

**Natural Logarithm:**

The natural logarithm, denoted as ln(x), is the inverse of the exponential function, e^x. It is defined for all positive real numbers x and is used in various fields, including mathematics, physics, and engineering. The natural logarithm is a fundamental function in many real-world applications, such as calculating the growth rate of populations, solving differential equations, and modeling exponential decay.

In the context of industrial control systems, the natural logarithm can be used to scale sensor signals, compute flow rates, and model energy relationships. For example, in a temperature control system, the natural logarithm can be used to convert a temperature difference into a proportional control signal. In a flow control system, the natural logarithm can be used to calculate the flow rate based on pressure and temperature measurements.

To implement the natural logarithm function block in IEC 61131-3 Structured Text, follow these steps:

1.	Create a function block named NaturalLog with:
	•	Input:
	•	X : REAL — the number to compute ln(X)
	•	Outputs:
	•	LnX : REAL — the result of ln(X)
	•	Error : BOOL — set to TRUE if X ≤ 0, indicating an invalid input
2.	Implement the logic:
	•	Use the built-in LN() function for valid inputs:

 IF X > 0.0 THEN
    LnX := LN(X);
    Error := FALSE;
ELSE
    LnX := 0.0;
    Error := TRUE;
END_IF;

3.	Ensure compatibility and efficiency:
	•	Avoid recursion or dynamic structures
	•	Ensure all code executes predictably within a scan cycle
	•	Optionally include versioning or diagnostic codes for system integration

The function block should be well-documented with inline comments explaining the mathematical foundation of the natural logarithm, the handling of invalid inputs, and the reasons for the chosen implementation. This documentation will help users understand the function block's purpose and ensure its proper use in real-time industrial control systems.
