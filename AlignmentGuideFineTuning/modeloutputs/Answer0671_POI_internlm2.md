**Control Narrative Beer Brewing:**

**1. Introduction**

The beer brewing process is a complex series of steps that transform raw materials into a finished product. This control narrative outlines the key stages of the brewing process, including the lautering stage, and provides specific setpoints and ranges for each stage. The lautering stage is critical for separating the liquid wort from the solid grains, and this narrative details the equipment, instrumentation, and control logic required to execute this process successfully.

**2. Mashing**

- **Setpoint:** Mash temperature = 65â€“68Â°C
- **Range:** Maintain temperature within Â±1Â°C of setpoint
- **P&ID Reference:** [Mash Tank]

**3. Boiling**

- **Setpoint:** Boil time = 60 minutes
- **Range:** Maintain boil time within Â±5 minutes of setpoint
- **P&ID Reference:** [Boiler]

**4. Lautering**

**4.1 Equipment and Instrumentation**

- **Lauter Tun:** Vessel for separating wort from spent grains
- **Rake Mechanism:** Stirring device to maintain grain bed stability
- **Sparge Arm:** Arm with perforated tube for sparging hot water
- **Pump:** For recirculation and wort transfer
- **Level Sensor:** Monitors lauter tun level
- **Turbidity Meter:** Measures wort clarity
- **Flow Transmitter:** Monitors sparge water flow rate
- **Temperature Probe:** Measures wort and sparge water temperature

**4.2 Control Steps**

1. **Start Recirculation Loop:**
   - Begin recirculation of wort through lauter tun to maintain grain bed stability
   - Setpoint: Flow rate = 10â€“15 L/min
   - Range: Maintain flow rate within Â±5% of setpoint
   - P&ID Reference: [Recirculation Pump]

2. **Monitor Turbidity:**
   - Continuously monitor turbidity until it drops below a predetermined threshold
   - Setpoint: Turbidity = 5 NTU (Nephelometric Turbidity Units)
   - Range: Maintain turbidity within Â±1 NTU of setpoint
   - P&ID Reference: [Turbidity
