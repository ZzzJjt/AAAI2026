### Intent:
**Intent Summary:**  
Create a Structured Text function block implementing the Simplex algorithm for linear programming in PLCs to enable on-device optimization of industrial processes (e.g., resource allocation, batch blending) with constraints on memory, execution time, and numerical precision.

### Prompt:
**Linear Programming:**

Develop a self-contained function block in IEC 61131-3 Structured Text to solve a linear programming problem using the simplex method. Ensure the function block is designed to handle multiple constraints and objective functions, with detailed comments explaining the algorithm and each computational step. Discuss the limitations of implementing linear programming in a PLC environment, particularly with respect to memory and processing power, and provide examples of how this function block could be applied in industrial optimization scenarios.
