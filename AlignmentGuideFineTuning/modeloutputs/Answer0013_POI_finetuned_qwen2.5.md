### Intent:
**Intent Summary:**  
Develop a MATLAB model of a distillation column's dynamic behavior (focusing on feed-rate/temperature relationships) and implement an MPC controller to optimize the process while adhering to operational constraintsâ€”without generating plots.  

*(Key focus: dynamic modeling + constraint-aware MPC for distillation, excluding visualization.)*

### Prompt:
**MATLAB Distillation Column Modeling and Control:**

Develop MATLAB code for a mathematical model of a distillation column, capturing its dynamic relationships between feed rates and temperature. Avoid plotting results.
Implement a model predictive control (MPC) scheme using the developed model to optimize the distillation process while considering operational constraints.

**B-A-B:**

ðŸŸ¥ Bï¼ˆBeforeï¼‰

Traditional methods for modeling and controlling distillation columns often fail to capture the complex dynamic interactions between feed rates and temperature, making it difficult to optimize performance under operational constraints.

ðŸŸ© Aï¼ˆAfterï¼‰

Develop a detailed MATLAB model that accurately represents the dynamic behavior of a distillation column, particularly the relationship between feed rates and temperature. Then, apply a model predictive control (MPC) strategy to optimize the distillation process in real time, ensuring efficient operation within specified constraintsâ€”all without producing any plots.

ðŸŸ§ Bï¼ˆBridgeï¼‰

Use MATLAB to construct a state-space or differential equation-based model of the distillation column. Implement the MPC algorithm using the built model to manage multivariable control and enforce constraints, focusing purely on the numerical output and optimization logic rather than graphical visualization.
