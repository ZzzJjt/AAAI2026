### Intent:
"Create a reusable IEC 61131-3 structured text function block that safely converts 10-digit decimal values to hexadecimal strings with edge-case handling for industrial PLC applications."

### Prompt:
**DecToHex:**
Implement a self-contained function block in IEC 61131-3 structured text to convert a 10-digit decimal value to hexadecimal. Ensure proper handling of large values and edge cases.

**C-A-R-E:**

ðŸŸ¥ C (Context) â€“ Background Situation

In industrial automation, converting decimal values to hexadecimal is essential for diagnostics, communication protocols, and memory addressing. However, IEC 61131-3 Structured Text does not always offer built-in methods to handle large decimal numbers (up to 10 digits) and edge cases such as zero or type overflow. A dedicated, reusable function block is needed to safely perform this conversion in scan-cycle-sensitive environments.

ðŸŸ© A (Action) â€“ Task to Perform

Develop a self-contained function block in IEC 61131-3 Structured Text that:
	â€¢	Accepts a 10-digit decimal input (LINT type recommended)
	â€¢	Converts the value to a hexadecimal string output
	â€¢	Includes proper handling of edge cases, such as zero values and upper-limit overflow
	â€¢	Uses a loop to divide the decimal by 16, maps the remainder to its corresponding hex digit (0â€“F), and assembles the hex string in reverse order
	â€¢	Optionally trims leading zeros and provides a minimal-length result

â¸»

ðŸŸ¨ R (Result) â€“ Expected Outcome

The result should be a modular and scan-safe function block that can be integrated into any PLC program requiring decimal-to-hex conversion. It should ensure accuracy, support a wide input range, and be easy to reuse, maintain, and document, making it ideal for use in logging, HMI displays, and communication routines.

ðŸŸ¦ E (Example) â€“ Concrete Illustration

Hereâ€™s a conceptual snippet of the core logic:

WHILE DecValue > 0 DO
   Remainder := DecValue MOD 16;
   HexDigit := DigitMap[Remainder]; // e.g., DigitMap[10] = 'A'
   HexString := CONCAT(HexDigit, HexString); // prepend digit
   DecValue := DecValue / 16;
END_WHILE;

IF HexString = '' THEN
   HexString := '0'; // handle zero input
END_IF;

ðŸŸª A (Analysis) â€“ Decomposition into Smaller Steps

â€¢	Define a function block with input (DecValue: LINT) and output (HexString: STRING).
â€¢	Initialize HexString to an empty string.
â€¢	Create a loop to divide DecValue by 16, storing the remainder in a variable.
â€¢	Use a lookup table (DigitMap) to map the remainder to its hexadecimal digit (0â€“F).
â€¢	Prepend the hex digit to HexString.
â€¢	Update DecValue by dividing it by 16.
â€¢	Repeat the loop until DecValue is zero.
â€¢	Handle the case of zero input by setting HexString to '0'.
â€¢	Return HexString.

**DecToHex:**

VAR
   DecValue: LINT;
   HexString: STRING[8];
   Remainder: LINT;
   DigitMap: ARRAY[0..15] OF CHAR := ['0', '1', '2', '3', '4', '5', '6', '7', '8', '9', 'A', 'B', 'C', 'D', 'E', 'F'];
   I: LINT := 0;
   J: LINT := 0;
END_VAR;

IF DecValue = 0 THEN
   HexString := '0';
ELSE
   WHILE DecValue > 0 DO
      Remainder := DecValue MOD 16;
      HexString[J] := DigitMap[Remainder];
      DecValue := DecValue / 16;
      J := J + 1;
   END_WHILE;
   HexString := CONCAT(HexString[J-1], HexString[1..J-1]);
END_IF;

RETURN HexString;

**End DecToHex.**
