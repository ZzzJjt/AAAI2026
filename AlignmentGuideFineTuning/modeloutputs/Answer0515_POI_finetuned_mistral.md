Summary:
Implements a function block to multiply two 4x4 matrices using IEC 61131-3 Structured Text.

Detailed Description:
This function block performs matrix multiplication between two 4x4 matrices, A and B, and returns the resulting 4x4 matrix, C. The implementation uses three nested FOR loops to iterate through the matrices, with one loop for the outermost row index, one for the middle column index, and one for the inner element index. The algorithm follows the standard matrix multiplication formula:

C[i,j] = Î£[k=1 to 4] A[i,k] * B[k,j]

Each element of the output matrix C is calculated by summing the products of corresponding elements from A and B. The function block is designed to be modular, reusable, and efficient within PLC scan-time constraints. It includes
