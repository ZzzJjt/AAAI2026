### Intent:
The task is to implement a model predictive control (MPC) system in Python that optimizes continuous cellulose fiber production by managing material flow through a two-stage batch process with time delays and fluctuating demand, ensuring high buffer tank levels to prevent downstream disruptions.  

(Key elements: MPC, hybrid continuous-batch process, delay compensation, demand variability, tank level maintenance)

### Prompt:
**Model Predictive Control for Continuous Cellulose Fiber Production Using Python:**

Explain how model predictive control (MPC) can optimize cellulose fiber production from wood, where continuous infeed and outfeed operations are required, while the material undergoes a two-stage batch process. The material is supplied at an average rate of 50 tons per hour, undergoing pre-treatment in a reactor followed by homogenization before entering a 1,000 cubic meter buffer tank. The product is extracted from the tank on demand, not at a constant rate. To minimize downtime in downstream processes, a high fill level in the tank must be maintained, despite the two-hour delay caused by upstream batch processes, making PID control unsuitable.

Develop Python code to simulate the system dynamics, including the dead time and fluctuating demand.

Implement Python code for a model predictive control (MPC) algorithm to optimize material flow, taking into account the time delay, fluctuating demand, and operational constraints.

**Detailed Answer:**

**Explanation of MPC's Advantage Over PID:**

Model Predictive Control (MPC) is a superior control strategy compared to Proportional-Integral-Derivative (PID) control for systems with time delays and fluctuating demands. PID control is a feedback control system that adjusts the output based on the current error, whereas MPC uses an optimization algorithm to predict the future behavior of the system and adjust the output accordingly.

In the context of continuous cellulose fiber production, PID control would struggle to maintain a high buffer tank level due to the two-hour delay caused by the two-stage batch process. The controller would react to the low tank level only after two hours, by which time the downstream process may already be disrupted. MPC, on the other hand, can account for the time delay by predicting the future state of the system and adjusting the input accordingly. It can also handle fluctuating demand by optimizing the input to meet the predicted demand while maintaining the high tank level.

**Python Simulation Model:**

The following Python code simulates the system dynamics of the reactorâ€“homogenizerâ€“tank system:

```python
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Parameters
K = 0.5  # Reactorâ€“homogenizer transfer constant
T = 2.0  # Time delay
C = 1.0  # Capacity of the buffer tank
D = 0.5  # Demand rate

# Initial conditions
t = 0.0
x = 0.0  # Material in the reactor
y = 0.0  # Material in the homogenizer
z = 0.0  # Material in the buffer tank

# Simulation loop
while z < C:
    # Update states
    dxdt = -K * x + 50.0  # Infeed rate
    dydt = K * x - D  # Outfeed rate
    dzdt = D - dydt  # Tank fill rate
    
    # Update states
    x += dxdt * (1 - t / T)
    y += dydt * (1 - t / T)
    z += dzdt * (1 - t / T)
    
    # Update time
    t += 0.1  # Time step
    
    # Print states
    print(f"t = {t:.2f},
