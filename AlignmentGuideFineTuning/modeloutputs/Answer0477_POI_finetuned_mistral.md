### Intent:
**Intent Summary:**  
Develop an IEC 61131-3 Structured Text program to monitor a distillation column's pressure and temperature, triggering safety interlocks (pressure relief valve, feed valve closure, and reboiler shutdown) upon overpressure, underpressure, or overtemperature conditions, with fail-safe defaults for sensor/valve faults.

### Prompt:
**Interlock Pressure Relief:**

Develop a self-contained IEC 61131-3 Structured Text program to implement an interlock system for opening a pressure relief valve in a vessel upon detecting overpressure. The program should monitor the vessel pressure using a pressure sensor and trigger the opening of the relief valve when the pressure exceeds a predefined safe limit.

The logic should ensure that the pressure relief valve remains open until the vessel pressure drops below a safe threshold. Additionally, incorporate safety checks to account for sensor failures or valve malfunctions, ensuring that the system defaults to a safe state in the event of a fault. Discuss the significance of pressure relief systems in protecting industrial processes from overpressure hazards and ensuring operational safety.

**R-I-S-E:**

ðŸŸ¥ R (Role) â€“ Your Role

Act as an industrial automation engineer responsible for implementing automated pressure relief interlock logic using IEC 61131-3 Structured Text to ensure safe operation of a pressurized vessel.

ðŸŸ© I (Input) â€“ What Youâ€™re Given

You are tasked with developing a self-contained Structured Text program to protect a vessel from overpressure. The system must:
	â€¢	Monitor pressure using a pressure transmitter (PT)
	â€¢	Open a pressure relief valve when the pressure exceeds a defined high limit (e.g., 15 bar)
	â€¢	Keep the valve open until the pressure drops below a reset threshold (e.g., 12 bar)
	â€¢	Include fail-safe logic that activates the relief valve in case of:
	â€¢	Sensor failure (e.g., invalid or stuck reading)
	â€¢	Valve malfunction
	â€¢	Ensure the system defaults to a safe state (valve open) when faults are detected

â¸»

ðŸŸ§ S (Steps) â€“ What You Need to Do
	1.	Declare variables for the pressure sensor (PT_101), relief valve (RELIEF_VALVE), fault inputs (SensorFault, ValveFault), and latching logic (SHUTDOWN_LATCH).
	2.	Implement interlock logic that:
	â€¢	Opens the relief valve when PT_101 > HIGH_LIMIT
	â€¢	Maintains the open state until PT_101 < RESET_LIMIT
	â€¢	Sets RELIEF_VALVE := TRUE if any fault condition is detected
	3.	Add latching and reset functionality to avoid premature valve closure.
	4.	Include comments and structure for readability, testing, and operational traceability.

â¸»

ðŸŸ¦ E (Expectation) â€“ What Success Looks Like

You produce a reliable, self-contained safety interlock that protects the vessel from overpressure. It reacts instantly to unsafe conditions, remains in a protective state until conditions stabilize, and automatically fails to a safe state during component faults. The interlock improves system safety, prevents equipment damage, and ensures compliance with industrial safety standards.
