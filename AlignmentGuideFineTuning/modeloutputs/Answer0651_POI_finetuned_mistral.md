### Intent:
**Intent Summary:**  
Create a reusable IEC 61131-3 Structured Text function block to perform an efficient binary search on a sorted 100-integer array with input validation, boundary management, and real-time PLC compatibility.  

*(Key focus: Binary search, structured text, PLC, input validation, real-time safety)*

### Prompt:
**Binary Search:**
Implement a self-contained function block in IEC 61131-3 structured text to perform a binary search on an array of 100 integers. Include input validation and efficient handling of search boundaries.

**R-I-S-E:**

ðŸŸ¥ R (Role) â€“ Define Your Role

Act as a PLC programmer tasked with developing a reusable and efficient search utility in IEC 61131-3 Structured Text for use in real-time automation systems.

ðŸŸ© I (Input) â€“ Information Provided

You are to implement a binary search algorithm within a function block that operates on an array of 100 integers. The function must:
	â€¢	Accept a sorted array, a target value, and an enable trigger
	â€¢	Perform input validation (e.g., index bounds, empty range)
	â€¢	Efficiently manage search boundaries (low, high, mid)
	â€¢	Return both a boolean flag (Found) and the index where the value was located (or -1 if not found)

â¸»

ðŸŸ§ S (Steps) â€“ Steps to Perform
	1.	Define a function block interface with inputs:
	â€¢	SearchArray : ARRAY[1..100] OF INT
	â€¢	TargetValue : INT
	â€¢	Enable : BOOL
	2.	Add internal variables for Low, High, Mid, and Found.
	3.	Use a WHILE loop to implement binary search logic:
	â€¢	Compare the middle element with the target
	â€¢	Adjust Low or High accordingly
	â€¢	Break on match or conclude if Low > High
	4.	Output:
	â€¢	Found : BOOL
	â€¢	Index : INT (valid index or -1)
	5.	Include input validation and comment the logic for maintainability.

â¸»

ðŸŸ¦ E (Expectation) â€“ Expected Outcome

Deliver a robust, reusable Structured Text function block that efficiently performs binary search on a fixed-size array. The implementation should be:
	â€¢	Scan-cycle safe for use in real-time PLC environments
	â€¢	Modular, with clear documentation and boundary checks
	â€¢	Adaptable for future use cases involving longer arrays or dynamic array sizes (with minor modifications)
