**Task:**
Create a Structured Text program that implements a cascaded PID control system for regulating pressure by adjusting flow rate. The program should include proper clamping and parameter tuning. Ensure the code is well-documented and follows best practices for readability and maintainability.

**Guidelines:**
	â€¢	Use the provided programming reference to ensure correct syntax and function usage.
	â€¢	Implement the control system using the PID algorithm for both the outer (pressure) and inner (flow rate) loops.
	â€¢	Include clamping mechanisms to prevent excessive adjustments.
	â€¢	Tune the PID parameters for optimal performance.
	â€¢	Document the code with comments explaining the purpose and functionality of each section.
	â€¢	Follow a consistent coding style and naming convention.

**Example Code Snippet:**
```structuredtext
// Define PID constants
VAR
    Kp, Ki, Kd : REAL := 0.5, 0.1, 0.05; // Proportional, Integral, Derivative gains
    Setpoint : REAL := 100.0; // Desired pressure
    FlowRate : REAL := 0.0; // Measured flow rate
    Pressure : REAL := 0.0; // Measured pressure
    Error : REAL := 0.0; // Difference between setpoint and measured pressure
    Integral : REAL := 0.0; // Integral of the error
    Derivative : REAL := 0.0; // Derivative of the error
    Output : REAL := 0.0; // Control output (flow rate adjustment)
END_VAR

// PID control algorithm
VAR
    ErrorPrev : REAL := 0.0; // Previous error value
    DerivativePrev : REAL := 0.0; // Previous derivative value
    IntegralPrev : REAL := 0.0; // Previous integral value
    OutputPrev : REAL := 0.0; // Previous control output
END_VAR

// Calculate error
Error := Setpoint - Pressure;

// Calculate integral
Integral := Integral + Error;

// Calculate derivative
Derivative := (Error - ErrorPrev) / (TIME_NOW - TIME_PREV);

// Calculate control output
Output := Kp * Error + Ki * Integral + Kd * Derivative;

// Clamp output to prevent excessive adjustments
IF Output > 100.0 THEN
    Output := 100.0;
ELSIF Output < -100.0 THEN
