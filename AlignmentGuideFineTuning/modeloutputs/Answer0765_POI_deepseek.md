### Intent:
The task involves creating a PLC program (IEC 61131-3) to automate urea synthesis by controlling raw material loading, reaction conditions (pressure/temperature), and emergency shutdowns via a state machine with safety interlocks and timing logic.  

**Intent summary for code generation:**  
*"Generate a state-driven PLC program for urea synthesis automation, handling phased control (loading/reaction/shutdown), sensor validation, safety interlocks, and configurable process parameters."*  

(Key focus: Sequential control + safety in chemical processes)

### Prompt:
**Learning IEC 61499:**
Provide a concise introduction to the IEC 61499 programming language, emphasizing key concepts for someone already familiar with IEC 61131-3. Include a comparison of their fundamental differences in terms of architecture, execution models, and flexibility for distributed control systems. Additionally, compile a list of five key references for further reading on IEC 61499, highlighting its relevance in modern industrial applications.

**R-T-F:**
