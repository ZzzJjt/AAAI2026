### Intent:
**Intent Summary:**  
Create a reusable IEC 61131-3 structured text function block to safely convert 10-digit decimal values (LINT) to hexadecimal strings, handling edge cases (zero, overflow) and ensuring scan-cycle-safe execution for industrial applications.

### Prompt:
**DecToHex:**
Implement a self-contained function block in IEC 61131-3 structured text to convert a 10-digit decimal value to hexadecimal. Ensure proper handling of large values and edge cases.

**R-I-S-E:**

ðŸŸ¥ R (Role) â€“ Define Your Role

Act as a PLC software developer implementing reliable and reusable conversion utilities in IEC 61131-3 Structured Text for industrial applications.

ðŸŸ© I (Input) â€“ Information Provided

You need to develop a function block that:
	â€¢	Accepts a 10-digit decimal input (e.g., up to 9999999999)
	â€¢	Converts this value to a hexadecimal representation
	â€¢	Handles large values and edge cases, such as overflow risk, zero input, or maximum data type limits
	â€¢	Returns the result as a STRING suitable for display, logging, or transmission
	â€¢	Must be self-contained and operate safely within scan-cycle execution

â¸»

ðŸŸ§ S (Steps) â€“ Steps to Perform
	1.	Declare the function block with an input DecValue : LINT and an output HexString : STRING.
	2.	Initialize internal variables: remainder, digit character map (0 to F), a temporary string buffer, and a loop counter.
	3.	Implement the conversion logic using a loop:
	â€¢	Divide the decimal value by 16
	â€¢	Map the remainder to its corresponding hex digit
	â€¢	Accumulate characters in reverse
	4.	Reverse the final result (if necessary) to correct the string order.
	5.	Add handling for special cases:
	â€¢	Input = 0 â†’ output "0"
	â€¢	Input > max LINT â†’ clip or raise a warning
	6.	Add inline comments explaining each major operation and safety consideration.

ðŸŸ¦ E (Expectation) â€“ Expected Outcome

The completed function block should reliably convert any valid 10-digit decimal input into a hexadecimal string, with correct formatting and protection against invalid values. It will serve as a modular utility block for various PLC programs where hexadecimal display, data formatting, or communication protocol encoding is needed.

The completed function block should reliably convert any valid 10-digit decimal input into a hexadecimal string, with correct formatting and protection against invalid values. It will serve as a modular utility block for various PLC programs where hexadecimal display, data formatting, or communication protocol encoding is needed. The self-contained nature of the function block ensures it can be safely called within a scan cycle, without requiring external state management or external function calls.
