### Intent:
"Develop a PLC program in Structured Text (ST) that implements a pick-and-place robot with two mutually exclusive modes (manual step-by-step control and automatic sequence) while ensuring safe operation through interlocking logic and timed movements."

### Prompt:
**Pick-and-Place Application for a Robot Using 61131-3 Structured Text:**

Write a PLC program in structured text (ST) according to IEC 61131-3 standards for a pick-and-place robotic application with two conveyors, following the process described below:

Process Description:

The system operates in two modes: Manual Mode and Auto Mode. These modes are interlocked, meaning only one can be active at any time.

	1.	Manual Mode:
	•	When the Manual button is pressed, the robotic arm will execute the following steps in response to individual manual commands:
	•	Clip: Clip the product from conveyor A.
	•	Transfer: Move the product to conveyor B.
	•	Release: Release the product onto conveyor B, allowing it to be carried away.
	2.	Auto Mode:
	•	When the Auto button is pressed, the robotic arm will execute the entire pick-and-place process automatically:
	•	Clip: Clip the product from conveyor A and hold it.
	•	Transfer: Transfer the product to conveyor B (this action takes 2 seconds).
	•	Release: Release the product onto conveyor B.
	•	The auto process completes after one cycle, but can be re-triggered by pressing the Auto button again.

The system should ensure that manual and auto modes cannot operate simultaneously, using interlocking logic to prevent conflicts between the two modes.

**B-A-B:**

🟥 B (Before) – The Challenge

In robotic automation systems, particularly pick-and-place applications, mode conflicts and unsafe transitions between manual and automatic operations can lead to mechanical errors, cycle interruptions, or even damage to products or equipment. Without clearly defined interlocks and sequencing logic, the robot may receive contradictory commands that cause unexpected behaviors.

🟩 A (After) – The Ideal Outcome

Develop a self-contained Structured Text (ST) program following IEC 61131-3 that:
	•	Implements two mutually exclusive modes: Manual and Auto
	•	In Manual Mode, responds only to individual commands:
	•	Clip – pick from conveyor A
	•	Transfer – move to conveyor B
	•	Release – drop on conveyor B
	•	In Auto Mode, performs the full pick-and-place sequence automatically in one trigger:
	•	Clip → Transfer (with a 2-second delay) → Release
	•	Prevents both modes from being active simultaneously using interlocking logic
	•	Allows Auto Mode to be re-triggered manually with a button

This approach ensures safe, structured, and reliable robot operation in both user-controlled and automated settings.

🟧 B (Bridge) – The Implementation Strategy

To build this logic, you can structure the ST code as follows:
VAR
    ManualMode, AutoMode : BOOL;
    BtnManual, BtnAuto : BOOL;
    CmdClip, CmdTransfer, CmdRelease : BOOL;
    AutoTrigger : BOOL;
    State : INT := 0;
    AutoTimer : TON;
END_VAR

// Interlock: Only one mode can be active
IF BtnManual THEN
    ManualMode := TRUE;
    AutoMode := FALSE;
ELSIF BtnAuto THEN
    AutoMode := TRUE;
    ManualMode := FALSE;
END_IF

// Manual Mode Operations
IF ManualMode THEN
    IF CmdClip THEN
        // Clip from conveyor A
    END_IF;
    IF CmdTransfer THEN
        // Transfer to conveyor B
    END_IF;
    IF CmdRelease THEN
        // Release on conveyor B
    END_IF;
END_IF

// Auto Mode Sequence (one-shot trigger)
IF AutoMode AND BtnAuto THEN
    AutoTrigger := TRUE;
END_IF

IF AutoMode AND AutoTrigger THEN
    CASE State OF
        0: 
            // Clip
            State := 1;
        1:
            // Transfer start
            AutoTimer(IN := TRUE, PT := T#2s);
            IF AutoTimer.Q THEN
                AutoTimer(IN := FALSE);
                State := 2;
            END_IF;
        2:
            // Release
            AutoTrigger := FALSE;
            State := 0;
    END_CASE;

This code ensures that the robot only executes one mode at a time, and that the Auto mode is triggered only once per button press. The Auto mode sequence is executed in a single-shot timer, with the timer reset and the state machine re-initialized after completion.
