### Prompt:
**Model Predictive Control for Optimizing Robot Movement Using Python:**

Develop Python code to implement a model predictive control (MPC) algorithm for optimizing the movement of a robot. The control system should consider dynamic constraints, path planning, and obstacle avoidance while ensuring smooth, efficient, and adaptive movement in a dynamic environment.

**C-A-R-E:**

ðŸŸ¥ Cï¼ˆContextï¼‰

Robots operating in dynamic environments often face challenges such as moving obstacles, tight path constraints, and the need for smooth and efficient motion. Traditional control methods may not adapt quickly enough to ensure safe and optimal navigation, especially when real-time decisions are required.

ðŸŸ© Aï¼ˆActionï¼‰

Develop Python code to implement a model predictive control (MPC) algorithm for robot motion optimization. The controller should handle path planning, obstacle avoidance, and dynamic constraints, while continuously predicting and adjusting the robotâ€™s movement to maintain smooth and efficient operation.

ðŸŸ¨ Rï¼ˆResultï¼‰

The resulting MPC-controlled robot should demonstrate adaptive, real-time trajectory optimization, maintaining smooth motion and effectively avoiding collisions. Compared to static or reactive control methods, the MPC approach should provide more intelligent and reliable navigation in complex environments.

ðŸŸ¦ Eï¼ˆExampleï¼‰

For example, simulate a robot navigating through a corridor with moving obstacles. Show how the MPC predicts future positions, reroutes accordingly, and maintains a smooth trajectoryâ€”avoiding jerky movements and ensuring timely arrival at the goal.

**Code Implementation:**

```python
import numpy as np
from scipy.optimize import minimize

class MPCController:
    def __init__(self, robot_model, horizon=10, dt=0.1):
        self.robot_model = robot_model
        self.horizon = horizon
        self.dt = dt

    def predict(self, state, control):
        # Predict future states given current state and control inputs
        return self.robot_model.predict(state, control, self.dt)

    def cost_function(self, control, state, goal):
        # Define a cost function that penalizes deviation from the goal and control effort
        future_states = [state]
        for i in range(self.horizon):
            future_states.append(self.predict(future_states[-1], control[i]))
        return np.sum((np.array(future_states) - goal)**2) + np.sum(control**2)

    def optimize(self, state, goal):
        # Optimize control inputs to minimize the cost function
        initial_control = np.zeros(self.horizon)
        result = minimize(self.cost_function, initial_control, args=(state, goal))
        return result.x

    def control(self, state, goal):
        # Compute control inputs for the current time step
        control = self.optimize(state, goal)
        return control[:1]  # Only use the first control input for the current time step

# Example usage
class SimpleRobotModel:
    def predict(self, state, control, dt):
        # Simple kinematic model for demonstration purposes
        return state + control * dt

robot_model = SimpleRobotModel()
controller = MPCController(robot_model, horizon=10, dt=0.1)

# Initial state and goal
state = np.array([0, 0])
goal = np.array([10, 10])

# Compute control input
control = controller.control(state, goal)
print("Control input:", control)
```

This code provides a basic framework for implementing an MPC controller in Python. It includes a simple robot model and a cost function that penalizes deviation from the goal and control effort. The `optimize` method uses the `minimize` function from `scipy.optimize` to find the optimal control inputs. The `control` method computes the control input for the current time step.
