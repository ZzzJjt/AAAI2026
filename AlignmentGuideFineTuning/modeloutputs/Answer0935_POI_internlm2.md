### Intent:
**Intent Summary:**  
Create a traffic light control system using IEC 61131-3 that manages normal operation, pedestrian requests, and emergency overrides via a finite state machine (FSM), ensuring safe transitions and prioritized responses to emergencies.

### Prompt:
**Learning IEC 61499:**
Provide a concise introduction to the IEC 61499 programming language, emphasizing key concepts for someone already familiar with IEC 61131-3. Include a comparison of their fundamental differences in terms of architecture, execution models, and flexibility for distributed control systems. Additionally, compile a list of five key references for further reading on IEC 61499, highlighting its relevance in modern industrial applications.

**T-A-G:**

ðŸŸ¥ T (Task) â€“ What You Need to Do

Introduce IEC 61499 to an audience that already understands IEC 61131-3. The focus should be on making the transition approachable by clearly explaining whatâ€™s new, whatâ€™s different, and why it matters for modern industrial systems.

â¸»

ðŸŸ© A (Action) â€“ How You Should Approach It
	1.	Summarize the key concepts of IEC 61499:
	â€¢	Event-driven architecture
	â€¢	Function blocks with separated event/data interfaces
	â€¢	Distribution across networked devices
	2.	Compare with IEC 61131-3 by highlighting differences in:
	â€¢	Execution models (event-driven vs. scan-based)
	â€¢	Architecture (distributed vs. centralized)
	â€¢	Reusability and portability (61499â€™s platform independence)
	3.	Compile a list of 5 recommended resources for further learning:
	â€¢	Standards documents, key textbooks, and application papers
	â€¢	Focus on modern use cases in distributed control and Industry 4.0

â¸»

ðŸŸ¦ G (Goal) â€“ What You Should Deliver
