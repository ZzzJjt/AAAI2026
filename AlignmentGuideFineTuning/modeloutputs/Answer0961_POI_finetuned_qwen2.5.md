ðŸŸ§ S (Steps) â€“ How to Do It

	1.	Define a self-contained function block named BinarySearch that accepts the required inputs:
	â€¢	SearchArray : ARRAY[1..100] OF INT
	â€¢	TargetValue : INT
	â€¢	Enable : BOOL
	2.	Implement the binary search algorithm using a WHILE loop or equivalent, ensuring efficient narrowing of the search window:
	â€¢	Define internal variables for Low, High, Mid, and status flags.
	â€¢	Perform input validation to ensure that the search boundaries are within the valid range of the array.
	â€¢	Implement the binary search logic, adjusting the search window based on comparisons between the target value and the middle element of the current window.
	â€¢	Track the status of the search (found/not found) and provide an output flag to indicate the result.
	3.	Add comments to explain the logic of the binary search algorithm, including the steps involved in narrowing the search window and the conditions for continuing or stopping the search.
	4.	Ensure that the function block is scan-cycle-safe and efficient, with comments explaining the scan-cycle-safe implementation of the search algorithm.
