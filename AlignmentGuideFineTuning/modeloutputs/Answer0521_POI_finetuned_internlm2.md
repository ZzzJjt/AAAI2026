### Intent:
**Intent Summary:**  
Develop an IEC 61131-3 Structured Text PLC program for an automatic car wash station that safely initiates washing only when a car is detected and no humans are present, immediately halts on human intrusion, and locks the system until the area is clear.  

*(Focus: Safety-critical control with sensor monitoring, process interruption, and state locking.)*

### Prompt:
**Automatic Car Wash Station Control Using 61131-3 Structured Text:**

Write a PLC program in structured text (ST) according to IEC 61131-3 standards to control an automatic car wash station with a single wash bay. The system should use a sensor to detect the presence of a car. Once the car is detected and no human is present in the wash area, the system should initiate the car wash process. If a human is detected within the car wash area at any point, the station should immediately stop the wash process, trigger an alarm, and remain in a safe state until the area is clear.

**R-I-S-E:**

ðŸŸ¥ R (Role) â€“ Your Role

You are a PLC programmer tasked with developing a safe and efficient control system for an automatic car wash station using IEC 61131-3 Structured Text (ST). Your objective is to ensure the wash cycle operates only under safe conditions and immediately halts in case of human presence.

ðŸŸ© I (Input) â€“ What Youâ€™re Given

You are provided with the following system components:
	â€¢	Sensors:
	â€¢	CarPresentSensor : BOOL â€” TRUE when a car is inside the wash bay
	â€¢	HumanDetectedSensor : BOOL â€” TRUE when a person is detected inside the bay
	â€¢	Outputs to control:
	â€¢	WashActive : BOOL â€” TRUE when the wash process is running
	â€¢	AlarmActive : BOOL â€” TRUE when a human is detected during wash operation
	â€¢	SafeToRun : BOOL â€” internal flag to lock/unlock wash permission based on safety state

â¸»

ðŸŸ§ S (Steps) â€“ What You Need to Do
	1.	Monitor the sensors each scan cycle:
	â€¢	Continuously check the presence of a car (CarPresentSensor)
	â€¢	Continuously check for human detection (HumanDetectedSensor)
	2.	Develop the control logic using structured text:
	â€¢	If a human is detected at any time, stop the wash (WashActive := FALSE), set the alarm (AlarmActive := TRUE), and disable further operation (SafeToRun := FALSE)
	â€¢	If a car is present, no human is detected, and SafeToRun = TRUE, allow the wash to start
	â€¢	Once the area is clear and the wash is inactive, reset SafeToRun to TRUE to enable a new cycle
	3.	Document each condition clearly with comments explaining:
	â€¢	The priority of human safety
	â€¢	Why the wash process must lock after a safety breach
	â€¢	How SafeToRun prevents immediate unsafe restarts

â¸»

ðŸŸ¦ E (Expectation) â€“ What Success Looks Like

You will have implemented a reliable and safe car wash controller that:
	â€¢	Starts washing only when a car is detected and no person is present
	â€¢	Instantly halts and alarms when a person enters during the cycle
	â€¢	Locks out the system until the area is verified clear and wash is idle
	â€¢	Can be easily integrated with HMI displays, safety relays, and alarm beacons
	â€¢	Follows structured and maintainable logic written according to IEC 61131-3 ST standards

ðŸŸª A (Additional) â€“ Context/Constraints

Focus on the safety-critical aspects of the car wash control system, ensuring that human presence is always prioritized over the wash process. The logic should be self-contained within the PLC, with minimal reliance on external systems. Emphasize the importance of locking out the system after a safety breach to prevent unintended restarts.

**C-A-R:**

ðŸŸ¥ C (Context) â€“ Background

Automatic car wash stations are becoming increasingly common in commercial settings. Ensuring the safety of both the car and the people operating the system is crucial. By implementing a self-contained PLC control system, you can ensure that the wash process only starts when a car is present and no humans are detected. This prevents accidents and ensures that the wash cycle is only initiated under safe conditions.

â¸»

ðŸŸ© A (Action) â€“ The Approach

To develop a self-contained PLC control system for an automatic car wash station, you will use IEC 61131-3 Structured Text (ST) to create a program that monitors the presence of a car and the detection of humans in the wash area. The program will use the sensor inputs to control the wash process, ensuring that it only starts when a car is present and no humans are detected. If a human is detected during the wash cycle, the system will immediately stop the wash, trigger an alarm, and lock the system until the area is clear.

ðŸŸ¨ R (Result) â€“ What Happened

You have successfully developed a self-contained PLC control system for an automatic car wash station using IEC 61131-3 Structured Text (ST). The program monitors the presence of a car and the detection of humans in the wash area, ensuring that the wash process only starts when a car is present and no humans are detected. If a human is detected during the wash cycle, the system will immediately stop the wash, trigger an alarm, and lock the system until the area is clear.
