ðŸŸ© I (Input) â€“ What Youâ€™re Given

You need to design a function block that:
	â€¢	Accepts a 10Ã—10 REAL matrix as input
	â€¢	Computes and outputs the eigenvalues in a 10-element REAL array
	â€¢	Includes comments explaining the algorithm steps (e.g., normalization, iteration, convergence check)

	â€¢	Numerical stability (e.g., rounding errors, floating-point limits)
	â€¢	Convergence of iterative algorithms
	â€¢	Execution time and performance in PLC environments

ðŸŸ§ S (Steps) â€“ What You Need to Do
	1.	Choose an appropriate algorithm (e.g., Power Iteration or a simplified QR method) suited for a PLCâ€™s processing capabilities
	2.	Create a function block structure with:
	â€¢	Matrix input: MatrixInput : ARRAY[1..10, 1..10] OF REAL
	â€¢	Eigenvalue output: EigenValues : ARRAY[1..10] OF REAL
	3.	Implement the core logic:
	â€¢	Initialize a vector
	â€¢	Perform matrix-vector multiplication
	â€¢	Normalize the vector
	â€¢	Estimate the dominant eigenvalue
	â€¢	Repeat with convergence threshold or iteration limit
	4.	Include detailed inline comments explaining:
	â€¢	Each stepâ€™s mathematical purpose
	â€¢	How you ensure convergence
	â€¢	How fail-safes are built in for real-time performance
	5.	Optionally: create a fallback output or diagnostic flag if the algorithm doesnâ€™t converge within a safe number of cycles

ðŸŸ¦ E (Expectation) â€“ What Success Looks Like

You produce a modular, well-documented function block that can be integrated into PLC projects needing matrix analysisâ€”especially useful in model-based control, signal processing, or system diagnostics. The function block:
	â€¢	Provides reasonably accurate eigenvalues under PLC constraints
	â€¢	Performs reliably within execution cycle time limits
	â€¢	Fails safely and predictably if it detects instability or divergence

ðŸŸ¨ S (Solution) â€“ How to Get There

1. **Choose an Algorithm:**
	â€¢	Consider the Power Iteration method, which is simple and efficient for PLCs. It iteratively improves an initial vector to find the dominant eigenvalue.
	â€¢	Alternatively, a simplified QR method could be used, which decomposes the matrix into orthogonal and triangular matrices, but it may be more complex to implement.
2. **Create the Function Block:**
	â€¢	Define the input and output variables as per the instructions.
	â€¢	Ensure the function block is self-contained, meaning it doesn't rely on external libraries or functions.
3. **Implement the Core Logic:**
	â€¢	Initialize a vector with random values or a specific pattern (e.g., all ones).
	â€¢	Perform matrix-vector multiplication, resulting in a new vector.
	â€¢	Normalize the vector to ensure it's not too large or too small.
	â€¢	Estimate the dominant eigenvalue by comparing the current vector's norm to the previous one.
	â€¢	Repeat the process until the difference between successive eigenvalues is below a predefined threshold or a maximum number of iterations is reached.
4. **Include Detailed Comments:**
	â€¢	Explain each step's mathematical purpose, such as why we're normalizing the vector or how the Power Iteration method works.
	â€¢	Describe how you ensure convergence, such as by monitoring the difference between successive eigenvalues or the rate of change in the vector.
	â€¢	Explain how fail-safes are built in for real-time performance, such as by setting a maximum number of iterations or a convergence threshold.
	â€¢	Consider adding a fallback output or diagnostic flag if the algorithm doesn't converge within a safe number of cycles.
5. **Test and Refine:**
	â€¢	Test the function block with various input matrices to ensure it works correctly and efficiently.
	â€¢	Refine the algorithm or implementation as needed to improve performance, stability, or accuracy.
