### Intent:
**Intent Summary:**  
Create an IEC 61131-3 Structured Text function block to perform iterative heapsort on integer arrays in PLCs, avoiding recursion and `DOWNTO` loops, with in-place sorting, input validation, and scan-cycle optimization for industrial applications.

### Prompt:
**Heapsort:**
Implement a self-contained function block in IEC 61131-3 structured text to perform the heapsort algorithm on an array of integers without using recursion or the â€˜DOWNTOâ€™ keyword in loops. Ensure efficient heap construction and sorting.

**R-T-F:**

ðŸŸ¥ R (Role) â€“ Define Your Role

Act as a control systems programmer implementing IEC 61131-3 Structured Text algorithms for efficient, standards-compliant sorting within programmable logic controllers (PLCs).

ðŸŸ© T (Task) â€“ Define the Objective

Develop a self-contained function block to implement the heapsort algorithm on an array of integers. The solution must:
	â€¢	Avoid recursion to ensure compatibility with PLC scan-cycle execution
	â€¢	Not use the DOWNTO keyword, relying instead on ascending index logic
	â€¢	Efficiently construct a max heap using iterative loops
	â€¢	Sort the array in-place for memory efficiency
	â€¢	Be robust, reusable, and well-documented for industrial applications

ðŸŸ§ F (Format) â€“ Specify the Output Format

Provide a complete IEC 61131-3 Structured Text function block with:
	â€¢	Inputs:
	â€¢	InputArray : ARRAY[1..N] OF INT
	â€¢	Execute : BOOL
	â€¢	Outputs:
	â€¢	SortedArray : ARRAY[1..N] OF INT (optional if sorting in-place)
	â€¢	Done : BOOL

Include:
	â€¢	An iterative heapify routine
	â€¢	Heap construction loop using ascending indexing
	â€¢	Sorting phase logic with controlled swaps and heap reduction
	â€¢	Inline comments explaining the heap logic, array access, and execution phases

**C-A-R-E:**

ðŸŸ¥ C (Context) â€“ Background Situation

Sorting algorithms in PLCs often rely on recursion or unsupported syntax, which can lead to scan-cycle blocking or poor performance. Heapsort is a powerful, in-place sorting algorithm that is efficient and well-suited for PLC environments, but implementing it in IEC 61131-3 Structured Text requires careful attention to scan-cycle safety and standard compliance.

ðŸŸ© A (Action) â€“ Task Steps

	1.	Define the function block with inputs and outputs:
	â€¢	InputArray : ARRAY[1..N] OF INT
	â€¢	Execute : BOOL
	â€¢	SortedArray : ARRAY[1..N] OF INT (optional)
	â€¢	Done : BOOL
	2.	Implement the heapify function to convert an array into a max heap:
	â€¢	For each node in the array, starting from the last non-leaf node:
	â€¢	â€¢	Compare the node with its children
	â€¢	â€¢	Swap if necessary to maintain the max heap property
	â€¢	â€¢	Perform the swap and adjust the heap accordingly
	3.	Implement the main heapsort logic:
	â€¢	â€¢	Heapify the entire array
	â€¢	â€¢	Repeatedly extract the maximum element (at the root) and swap it with the last element in the heap
	â€¢	â€¢	Reduce the heap size and heapify the remaining elements
	â€¢	â€¢	Track the sorting progress with the Done flag
	4.	Add detailed comments explaining the heap construction, sorting process, and scan-cycle-safe execution
	5.	Ensure the function block is self-contained and includes all necessary logic for in-place sorting

â¸»

ðŸŸ§ R (Result) â€“ Expected Outcome

The function block should:
	â€¢	Accept an input array and execute the heapsort algorithm
	â€¢	Sort the array in-place or provide a sorted output array
	â€¢	Be scan-cycle-safe, with efficient heap construction and sorting logic
	â€¢	Be well-documented, explaining the algorithmâ€™s steps and limitations
	â€¢	Be reusable in industrial control systems, where scan-cycle efficiency is critical
