⸻

🟩 A (Action) – How It Works
	1.	Inputs:
	•	SP (Setpoint): The desired target value of the process (e.g., 75°C).
	•	PV (Process Variable): The actual measured value (e.g., current temperature).
	•	Kp, Ki, Kd: Tuning constants that define proportional, integral, and derivative behavior.
	•	Optional: MANUAL mode for overriding automatic control, and LIMIT_HI / LIMIT_LO for output clamping.
	2.	Processing:
	•	Computes Error := SP - PV.
	•	Calculates:
	•	Proportional Term: Kp * error
	•	Integral Term: Ki * ∫ error dt (to remove steady-state offset)
	•	Derivative Term: Kd * d(error)/dt (to dampen sudden changes)
	•	Combines these to form the control signal (OUT), with output limiting and anti-windup protection.
	3.	Outputs:
	•	OUT: The control signal to the actuator (e.g., valve position, motor speed).
	•	ERROR: Real-time deviation between SP and PV.
	•	Status flags: Such as saturation indicators (if limits are reached).

🟦 G (Goal) – What You Achieve

By using the OSCAT PID function block, you can:
	•	Maintain stable and accurate control over critical process parameters like pressure, temperature, or flow.
	•	Optimize process performance through real-time corrections.
	•	Reduce manual tuning and improve fault resilience with built-in saturation and mode-handling features.
	•	Apply PID logic to a wide variety of automation scenarios, from chemical dosing to speed regulation and HVAC systems.

🟨 I (Impact) – Why It Matters

The OSCAT PID function block is essential for effective process control in industrial automation because it provides a reliable and flexible way to regulate critical parameters. By tuning the PID controller, you can optimize performance, reduce errors, and minimize the impact of disturbances. This ensures consistent product quality, maximizes efficiency, and helps maintain a safe and stable production environment.
