### Intent:
**Intent Summary:**  
Create a text-based Piping and Instrumentation Diagram (P&ID) for a power plant's steam-water cycle, detailing equipment, instrumentation, control loops, and tagged signal pathways to support PLC/DCS programming and cross-functional collaboration.  

**Code Generation Focus:**  
Structured plain-text representation of process flow, control logic, and safety interlocks with ISA-5.1-compliant tags for automation system integration.

### Prompt:
**P-ID Steam Water Cycle:**

Create a P&I diagram in textual notation for a steam water cycle in a power plant. Include equipment, instrumentation, piping, and control loops. Provide concrete tag names.


**R-I-S-E:**

ðŸŸ¥ R (Role) â€“ Define Your Role

Act as a process control engineer responsible for documenting the steam-water cycle of a power plant using text-based P&ID notation for use in early design, instrumentation planning, or control logic development.

â¸»

ðŸŸ© I (Input) â€“ Information Provided

You are to create a textual Piping and Instrumentation Diagram (P&ID) that covers the full steam-water cycle, including:
	â€¢	Major equipment (e.g., boiler, steam drum, feedwater pump, condenser)
	â€¢	Associated instrumentation (e.g., transmitters, controllers, control valves)
	â€¢	Piping flow direction using arrows (-->)
	â€¢	Concrete tag names for all components (e.g., FT101, LT102, FCV103)

The output should mirror the clarity of a traditional P&ID but in structured text form, supporting use cases where graphics are unavailable or impractical.

ðŸŸ§ S (Steps) â€“ Steps to Perform
	1.	List key components of the steam-water cycle in operational order:
	â€¢	Feedwater Pump â†’ Boiler â†’ Steam Drum â†’ Turbine â†’ Condenser â†’ Back to Feed
	2.	For each equipment item, identify the associated instrumentation and control loops, e.g.:
	â€¢	FT101 (Flow Transmitter), FIC101 (Flow Controller), FCV101 (Flow Control Valve)
	3.	Connect elements using text-based flow notation, e.g.:

 P01 --> FT101 --> FIC101 --> FCV101 --> B01

 4.	Ensure each control loop includes a transmitter, controller, and actuator, and assign clear tag numbers.
	5.	Organize the diagram in logical blocks (e.g., Feedwater System, Boiler Section, Condensate Return) for readability.

â¸»

ðŸŸ¦ E (Expectation) â€“ Expected Outcome

Deliver a text-based P&ID that provides a complete, readable map of the steam-water cycle, including all control logic and signal pathways. It should:
	â€¢	Support cross-functional collaboration (engineering, automation, commissioning)
	â€¢	Serve as input for PLC/DCS programming
	â€¢	Ensure traceability through clearly labeled tags and flow paths
	â€¢	Be portable and editable in plain-text tools and version control systems

ðŸŸ¨ C (Code) â€“ Text-based P&ID Example

```
P01 --> FT101 --> FIC101 --> FCV101 --> B01

Feedwater System:
FWP01 --> FT201 --> FIC201 --> FCV201
FWP02 --> FT301 --> FIC301 --> FCV301
FWP03 --> FT401 --> FIC401 --> FCV401

Boiler Section:
FT501 --> FIC501 --> FCV501

Steam Drum:
FT601 --> FIC601 --> FCV601

Turbine:
FT701 --> FIC701 --> FCV701

Condenser:
FT801 --> FIC801 --> FCV801

Back to Feed:
FWP04 --> FT901 --> FIC901 --> FCV901
```

In this example, the steam-water cycle is divided into logical blocks for easier understanding. Each block contains the necessary instrumentation and control loops, and the flow of steam is clearly marked. The tags are consistent and descriptive, aiding in the automation system integration process.
