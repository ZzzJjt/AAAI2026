### Intent:
**Intent Summary:**  
Implement a model predictive control (MPC) system in Python to optimize continuous cellulose fiber production by managing upstream batch delays (2-hour dead time) and fluctuating demand, ensuring high buffer tank fill levels to prevent downstream disruptions.  

*(Focus: MPC for dead-time compensation, demand variability, and tank-level stability in a hybrid batch/continuous process.)*

### Prompt:
**Model Predictive Control for Continuous Cellulose Fiber Production Using Python:**

Explain how model predictive control (MPC) can optimize cellulose fiber production from wood, where continuous infeed and outfeed operations are required, while the material undergoes a two-stage batch process. The material is supplied at an average rate of 50 tons per hour, undergoing pre-treatment in a reactor followed by homogenization before entering a 1,000 cubic meter buffer tank. The product is extracted from the tank on demand, not at a constant rate. To minimize downtime in downstream processes, a high fill level in the tank must be maintained, despite the two-hour delay caused by upstream batch processes, making PID control unsuitable.

Develop Python code to simulate the system dynamics, including the dead time and fluctuating demand.

Implement Python code for a model predictive control (MPC) algorithm to optimize material flow, taking into account the time delay, fluctuating demand, and operational constraints.

**B-A-B:**

ðŸŸ¥ Bï¼ˆBeforeï¼‰

Continuous cellulose fiber production from wood involves a two-stage batch process followed by storage in a buffer tank. Although material is fed continuously at 50 tons/hour, the upstream processes (reactor and homogenizer) introduce a two-hour delay. Meanwhile, product outfeed is demand-driven and varies over time. Traditional PID control struggles to handle these dynamics, leading to potential tank underfill and costly downstream process interruptions.

ðŸŸ© Aï¼ˆAfterï¼‰

Use model predictive control (MPC) to optimize material flow in real time, accounting for dead time, batch-process delays, and fluctuating product demand. The system should maintain a high fill level in the buffer tank to ensure seamless downstream operations and reduce the risk of downtime.

ðŸŸ§ Bï¼ˆBridgeï¼‰

Explain the advantages of MPC in handling multi-stage processes with delays and variability. Then, develop Python code to simulate the system dynamicsâ€”including upstream batch delays and stochastic demand. Implement an MPC algorithm that anticipates future demand, optimizes infeed rates, and ensures buffer tank stability within operational constraints.
