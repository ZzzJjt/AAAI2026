### Prompt:
**Poisson Distribution:**

Design a self-contained function block in IEC 61131-3 Structured Text to compute the Poisson distribution for a given mean (Î») and input value.

**C-A-R-E:**

ðŸŸ¥ C (Context) â€“ The Background

In industrial automation and process monitoring, itâ€™s often important to predict the likelihood of discrete events occurring over a period of timeâ€”such as sensor triggers, part arrivals, or faults. The Poisson distribution is widely used in such event-driven systems to estimate the probability of a certain number of events happening within a fixed interval. However, most IEC 61131-3 Structured Text environments do not provide built-in statistical functions, making it necessary to implement this computation manually and carefully handle numerical stability and factorials.

ðŸŸ© A (Action) â€“ The Implementation Task

Create a self-contained function block in IEC 61131-3 Structured Text, named PoissonProbability, which:
	â€¢	Inputs:
	â€¢	Lambda : REAL â€“ the average number of expected events (Î»)
	â€¢	K : INT â€“ the number of observed events
	â€¢	Output:
	â€¢	Probability : REAL â€“ the result of the Poisson distribution calculation:
P(k; \lambda) = \frac{e^{-\lambda} \cdot \lambda^k}{k!}
	â€¢	Steps to implement:
	1.	Calculate the exponential component using EXP(-Lambda)
	2.	Raise Lambda to the power of K using POW(Lambda, K)
	3.	Compute K! using a loop
	4.	Combine all terms to get the result
	â€¢	Comment your code to explain:
	â€¢	The mathematical basis of the Poisson formula
	â€¢	Why and how the factorial is computed manually
	â€¢	How the block handles edge cases such as K < 0 or Lambda â‰¤ 0
	â€¢	Optimize for real-time use:
	â€¢	Avoid recursion
	â€¢	Keep loop depth fixed
	â€¢	Use REAL types to minimize overflow

ðŸŸ¨ R (Result) â€“ The Expected Outcome

The result is a modular and reusable function block that:
	â€¢	Accurately computes the Poisson probability
	â€¢	Is safe for use in PLC environments, with deterministic execution
	â€¢	Handles edge cases and overflows gracefully
	â€¢	Can be applied in:
	â€¢	Event prediction (e.g., machine faults)
	â€¢	Production variability modeling
	â€¢	Queue arrival simulations
	â€¢	Provides an essential statistical tool for real-time diagnostic or prediction logic

Imagine a sensor that detects metal parts passing on a conveyor belt. If the expected average rate is 4 parts/min (Î» = 4), and 2 parts are observed in one minute (K = 2), this block calculates the probability of that event:

// INPUT: Lambda := 4.0; K := 2
