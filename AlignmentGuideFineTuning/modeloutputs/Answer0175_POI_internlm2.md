### Intent:
**Intent Summary:**  
Create an IEC 61131-3 Structured Text function block to iteratively perform heapsort on an integer array without recursion or `DOWNTO` loops, ensuring industrial PLC compatibility, in-place sorting, and clear documentation.  

*(Focus: Iterative heapsort, PLC constraints, reusability, and industrial deployment.)*

### Prompt:
**Heapsort:**
Implement a self-contained function block in IEC 61131-3 structured text to perform the heapsort algorithm on an array of integers without using recursion or the â€˜DOWNTOâ€™ keyword in loops. Ensure efficient heap construction and sorting.

**B-A-B:**

ðŸŸ¥ B (Before) â€“ The Problem or Challenge

Sorting algorithms are essential for many automation tasks such as prioritization, scheduling, and sensor data organization. However, many traditional sorting routines rely on recursion or unsupported syntax like the DOWNTO keyword, which are not always practical or allowed in IEC 61131-3 Structured Text. Without a properly structured iterative approach, implementing heapsortâ€”an efficient, in-place comparison-based sorting algorithmâ€”can be complex, error-prone, and inefficient in a PLC environment.

ðŸŸ© A (After) â€“ The Desired Outcome

Implement a self-contained function block in IEC 61131-3 Structured Text that performs the heapsort algorithm on an array of integers. The function block must:
	â€¢	Avoid recursion entirely
	â€¢	Avoid the use of DOWNTO loops for compatibility
	â€¢	Build the heap using an efficient iterative max-heapify process
	â€¢	Perform in-place sorting of the array with high execution reliability and scan-cycle compatibility
	â€¢	Be reusable and well-commented for deployment in industrial control logic

â¸»

ðŸŸ§ B (Bridge) â€“ How to Get There
	1.	Define a function block with inputs like InputArray : ARRAY[1..N] OF INT, and Execute : BOOL.
	2.	Use internal iterative logic to:
	â€¢	Build a max heap from the array (starting from the middle and working backwards using FOR loops)
	â€¢	Repeatedly swap the first and last unsorted elements and reduce the heap size
	â€¢	Call a custom iterative heapify function to restore heap order
	3.	Ensure sorting happens in-place for memory efficiency.
	4.	Include logic state tracking (e.g., Step : INT) if needed to spread execution over multiple scan cycles.
	5.	Provide outputs such as a sorted array and a Done : BOOL flag.
	6.	Comment all major operations and decisions for clarity.

**Example:**

```IEC
FUNCTION_BLOCK SortArray : BOOL
INPUTS
  InputArray : ARRAY[1..N] OF INT,
  Execute : BOOL
OUTPUTS
  SortedArray : ARRAY[1..N] OF INT,
  Done : BOOL
END_FUNCTION_BLOCK

VAR_INPUT
  InputArray : ARRAY[1..N] OF INT,
  Execute : BOOL
END_VAR_INPUT

VAR_OUTPUT
  SortedArray : ARRAY[1..N] OF INT,
  Done : BOOL
END_VAR_OUTPUT

VAR
  Step : INT := 0,
  N : INT := SIZE(InputArray),
  I : INT := N / 2,
  J : INT := 1
END_VAR

IF Execute THEN
  IF Step = 0 THEN
    FOR I := N / 2 DOWNTO 1 DO
      MAX_HEAPIFY(InputArray, I, N)
    END_FOR
  END_IF

  IF Step = 0 THEN
    SortedArray := InputArray
  ELSE IF Step = 1 THEN
    FOR J := 1 TO N - 1 DO
      IF J MOD 2 = 0 THEN
        SWAP(InputArray, J, N - J)
      END_IF
      HEAPIFY(InputArray, J, N - J)
    END_FOR
  END_IF

  IF Step = 1 THEN
    SortedArray := InputArray
    Done := TRUE
  END_IF

  Step := Step + 1
END_IF
```

**Key Points:**

- The function block is designed to be reusable and well-documented for industrial control logic.
- The function block avoids recursion and DOWNTO loops for compatibility with IEC 61131-3 Structured Text.
- The function block performs in-place sorting of the array for memory efficiency.
- The function block includes logic state tracking (e.g., Step : INT) if needed to spread execution over multiple scan cycles.
- The function block includes comments for clarity and understanding.
- The function block is designed to be easily integrated into existing control logic and can be used for a variety of sorting tasks in industrial automation.
