### Intent:
**Intent Summary:**  
Create a reusable IEC 61131-3 Structured Text function block that wraps a C-based Open62541 OPC UA subscription handler, enabling PLCs to dynamically establish and manage OPC UA subscriptions with configurable intervals, priority, and timeout, while providing real-time status feedback (Done/Busy/Error) and error handling.  

*(Focus: C-to-ST integration for OPC UA subscriptions with cyclic execution and adjustable parameters.)*

### Prompt:
**OPC UA Subscription Creation Using Open62541 and IEC 61131-3 Structured Text:**

Develop a C function block for OPC UA subscription creation using the Open62541 library, which will be wrapped in IEC 61131-3 structured text code. The function block receives a Connection Handle as a DWORD and has the following inputs: an executed flag (BOOL), a priority (BYTE), and a timeout (TIME). As outputs, it provides three status flags (Done, Busy, Error) along with two DWORD outputs (ErrorID, SubscriptionHdl). The function block also includes an IN/OUT variable PublishingInterval (type TIME), which allows dynamic adjustment of the subscription interval.

In your explanation, describe how this C function block can be wrapped inside IEC 61131-3 structured text code, highlighting the integration steps and providing an example of how to call the function block within an ST program. Discuss error handling, subscription management, and real-time communication with OPC UA servers.

**R-T-F:**

ðŸŸ¥ R (Role) â€“ Your Role

Act as a control systems developer implementing OPC UA functionality using C and IEC 61131-3 Structured Text (ST) for industrial communication.

ðŸŸ© T (Task) â€“ What You Need to Do

Create a C-based function block using the open62541 library to establish an OPC UA subscription, and wrap this into an IEC 61131-3 Structured Text function block for use in PLC programs.

The ST function block should include the following interface:

Inputs:
	â€¢	Execute (BOOL): Triggers the subscription creation
	â€¢	ConnectionHdl (DWORD): OPC UA session handle
	â€¢	Priority (BYTE): Subscription priority level
	â€¢	Timeout (TIME): Max wait duration for the operation
	â€¢	PublishingInterval (IN/OUT, TIME): The data update interval, dynamically adjustable

Outputs:
	â€¢	Done (BOOL): Indicates successful subscription creation
	â€¢	Busy (BOOL): TRUE while the operation is in progress
	â€¢	Error (BOOL): Set if an error occurs
	â€¢	ErrorID (DWORD): Provides a specific error code
	â€¢	SubscriptionHdl (DWORD): The handle of the newly created subscription

Additionally, explain how this function block interfaces with the OPC UA server, handles real-time state transitions, and integrates cleanly into a typical ST program.

ðŸŸ§ F (Format) â€“ Expected Output

Provide:
	â€¢	A well-structured C implementation for OPC UA subscription creation using open62541
	â€¢	An ST function block that wraps the C functionality and maps all I/O
	â€¢	Logic for rising-edge detection on Execute, management of Busy/Done/Error flags, and dynamic publishing interval updates
	â€¢	Example ST code showing how the function block is instantiated and executed in a cyclic task
	â€¢	Comments and documentation to support reusability and integration in industrial control systems
