### Prompt:
**Control Narrative for Ammonium Nitrate Reactor**

Create a control narrative for a reactor producing ammonium nitrates including concrete setpoints and ranges.

**C-A-R-E:**

ðŸŸ¥ C (Context) â€“ Background Situation

In ammonium nitrate production, the reactor is a critical unit where ammonia and nitric acid react under controlled temperature and pressure conditions. A well-defined control narrative is essential for ensuring safety, optimizing yield, and maintaining regulatory compliance. Without clear setpoints, instrumentation, and sequence logic, the process may suffer from inefficiencies or become hazardous.

ðŸŸ© A (Action) â€“ Task to Perform

Create a control narrative for an ammonium nitrate reactor, focusing on:
	â€¢	Specifying concrete control setpoints and operational ranges for key process parameters
	â€¢	Identifying the necessary equipment and instrumentation (e.g., flow controllers, pH sensors, pressure and temperature transmitters)
	â€¢	Outlining the normal operating sequence, including startup, steady-state operation, and shutdown procedures
	â€¢	Describing the control loops and interlock logic for alarms or emergency shutdown conditions

â¸»

ðŸŸ¨ R (Result) â€“ Expected Outcome

The final deliverable should be a clear and structured control narrative that can be used by engineers, operators, and programmers to:
	â€¢	Ensure safe and consistent operation of the reactor
	â€¢	Support PLC/DCS programming
	â€¢	Simplify commissioning, training, and troubleshooting
	â€¢	Provide a solid foundation for future automation upgrades

Instrumentation and Equipment:
	â€¢	Flow transmitters on acid and ammonia lines
	â€¢	Pressure and temperature transmitters on reactor dome
	â€¢	pH sensor in reactor outlet
	â€¢	Emergency shutoff valves with interlocks tied to high temperature (>185â€¯Â°C), overpressure (>5.2â€¯bar), or low pH (<5.5)

Operational Sequence Overview:
	1.	Initialize system; confirm all valves in closed and tank levels in range
	2.	Begin controlled ammonia and nitric acid flow
	3.	Ramp up reactor temperature using steam jacket
	4.	Adjust ammonia-to-acid ratio to maintain pH
	5.	Monitor steady-state; activate alarms/interlocks on deviation
	6.	Shutdown by closing feeds and venting pressure safely
