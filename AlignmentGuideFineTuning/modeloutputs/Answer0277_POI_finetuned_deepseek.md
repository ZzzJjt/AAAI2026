### Intent:
**Intent Summary:**  
Create a robust IEC 61131-3 Structured Text function block (`NaturalLog`) that safely computes the natural logarithm of a positive real input, handles invalid inputs (â‰¤0/NaN) with error flags and diagnostics, and ensures deterministic execution for industrial applications like sensor linearization or decay modeling.  

*(Key focus: Safety, edge-case handling, and industrial practicality.)*

### Prompt:
**Natural Logarithm:**

Develop a self-contained function block in IEC 61131-3 Structured Text to compute the natural logarithm of a given input. Ensure that the implementation is efficient and well-documented, with comments explaining the mathematical foundation of the natural logarithm. Additionally, address potential edge cases, such as handling non-positive inputs, and discuss the precision and performance of this function block in typical industrial applications.

ðŸŸ¥ C (Context) â€“ The Background

In industrial control systems, functions like the natural logarithm (ln) are often required for applications such as sensor calibration, flow linearization, and modeling exponential decay. However, many PLC platforms programmed using IEC 61131-3 Structured Text do not provide reliable built-in logarithmic functions or may behave unpredictably with invalid inputs such as zero or negative numbers. A well-documented and error-resistant function block is essential for safety and accuracy.

ðŸŸ© A (Action) â€“ The Implementation Task

Create a self-contained IEC 61131-3 Structured Text function block, named NaturalLog, that:
	â€¢	Accepts an input:
	â€¢	X : REAL â€“ the number for which to calculate the natural logarithm
	â€¢	Returns an output:
	â€¢	LnX : REAL â€“ the natural logarithm of X
	â€¢	Includes an error flag:
	â€¢	Error : BOOL â€“ set to TRUE if the input is zero or negative
	â€¢	Implements logic as follows:
	â€¢	If X > 0, use LN(X) (built-in function)
	â€¢	If X â‰¤ 0, set LnX := 0.0 and raise the Error flag
	â€¢	Contains clear inline comments explaining:
	â€¢	The mathematical principle: ln(x) is undefined for x â‰¤ 0
	â€¢	Why the LN() function is used (or provide approximation fallback)
	â€¢	How the block ensures safe behavior and deterministic execution
	â€¢	Optimizes for real-time control system constraintsâ€”no recursion, fixed logic flow, and deterministic execution time

â¸»

ðŸŸ¨ R (Result) â€“ The Expected Outcome

You will have a robust function block that:
	â€¢	Safely computes ln(x) for valid inputs
	â€¢	Detects and handles invalid inputs to prevent runtime faults
	â€¢	Can be reused in any application requiring exponential/logarithmic calculations, such as:
	â€¢	Sensor signal linearization
	â€¢	Chemical concentration decay models
	â€¢	PID gain scheduling based on logarithmic response curves
	â€¢	Ensures performance, readability, and safety across industrial platforms

ðŸŸ¦ E (Example) â€“ A Practical Use Case

In a flow measurement application, a PLC receives a voltage signal that represents logarithmic flow. To linearize it, the engineer uses the NaturalLog block:
IF X > 0.0 THEN
    LnX := LN(X);
    Error := FALSE;
ELSE
    LnX := 0.0;
    Error := TRUE;
END_IF;

In a flow measurement application, a PLC receives a voltage signal that represents logarithmic flow. To linearize it, the engineer uses the NaturalLog block:
IF X > 0.0 THEN
    LnX := LN(X);
    Error := FALSE;
ELSE
    LnX := 0.0;

This ensures that the linearized flow signal is always positive and well-defined, while also providing diagnostic feedback if the input is invalid.
(* IEC 61131-3 Structured Text: NaturalLog Function Block *)
(* Purpose: Computes natural logarithm of a real input, handles invalid inputs *)

FUNCTION_BLOCK NaturalLog
VAR_INPUT
    X : REAL; (* Input number for which to compute ln(x) *)

(* Main Logic *)
IF X > 0.0 THEN
