### Intent:
**Intent Summary:**  
Create a NORSOK-compliant textual System Control Diagram (SCD) for an LNG vaporizer system, detailing instrumentation (e.g., FT101, TIC201), control loops (PID logic for flow/pressure/temperature), safety interlocks (ESD triggers), and piping flow, formatted for clarity and traceability.  

**Code-Generation Intent:**  
Generate a structured textual representation of control logic, instrumentation tags, and interlock sequences for an LNG vaporizer system, adhering to NORSOK I-005 standards.  

*(Output format: Hierarchical text with arrows (-->), grouped sections, and explicit tag references for control loops, alarms, and shutdown logic.)*

### Prompt:
**SCD LNG Vaporizer:**

Create a NORSOK system control diagram (SCD) in textual notation for a LNG Vaporizer System. Include instrumentation, control loops, and interlocks. Provide concrete tag numbers and piping.


**C-A-R-E:**

ðŸŸ¥ C (Context) â€“ Background Situation

In LNG (Liquefied Natural Gas) processing, the vaporizer system plays a critical role in converting LNG into gas for downstream use. For projects governed by NORSOK standards, a System Control Diagram (SCD) is required to document control loops, instrumentation, and interlocks in a structured, traceable format. When graphical SCD tools are unavailableâ€”such as in early design phases or text-based engineering environmentsâ€”engineers must rely on textual notation to convey the same level of detail and logic clarity.

ðŸŸ© A (Action) â€“ Task to Perform

Create a NORSOK-compliant System Control Diagram (SCD) using textual notation for an LNG vaporizer system. The diagram should include:
	â€¢	Major equipment and piping flow (e.g., LNG inlet â†’ vaporizer â†’ gas outlet)
	â€¢	Key instrumentation and control loops, with standard tag names (e.g., TT101, FIC201, FCV202)
	â€¢	Defined interlocks and trip signals, such as high-pressure shutdowns or emergency stop triggers
	â€¢	Logical formatting using directional arrows (-->), indents, and grouped sections for clarity

â¸»

ðŸŸ¨ R (Result) â€“ Expected Outcome

The result will be a structured, readable, and logically complete textual SCD that can:
	â€¢	Support system design, safety analysis, and DCS/PLC implementation
	â€¢	Facilitate interdepartmental review of instrumentation and control logic
	â€¢	Comply with NORSOK I-005 standards for system documentation
	â€¢	Act as a draft for graphical SCD development later in the design phase

ðŸŸ§ S (Safety) â€“ Potential Hazards

While creating a textual SCD, it is crucial to ensure that all safety interlocks and trip signals are correctly identified and implemented. Inaccurate or incomplete interlocks can lead to system failures, equipment damage, or safety hazards. Therefore, it is essential to double-check the SCD against the design specifications and consult with safety experts to ensure all safety-critical elements are accounted for.

ðŸŸª T (Tips) â€“ Best Practices

1. **Use Standard Tag Nomenclature:** Adhere to the NORSOK I-005 standard for tag naming conventions, which includes prefixes for equipment, control loops, and interlocks (e.g., TT for temperature, PS for pressure, FCV for flow control valve).

2. **Maintain Logical Flow:** Organize the SCD in a way that mirrors the physical flow of the system, with arrows indicating the direction of control and interlocks.

3. **Include All Control Loops:** Ensure that all control loops, including those for temperature, pressure, and flow, are represented in the SCD.

4. **Verify Interlocks:** Double-check that all safety interlocks are correctly identified and that they are triggered by the appropriate process variables.

5. **Review with Stakeholders:** Share the SCD with other engineers, safety experts, and project stakeholders to ensure that it accurately represents the control logic and interlocks.

6. **Prepare for Graphical Conversion:** If the SCD will be converted to a graphical format later, consider using a text editor that supports copy-paste functionality to facilitate the transition.
