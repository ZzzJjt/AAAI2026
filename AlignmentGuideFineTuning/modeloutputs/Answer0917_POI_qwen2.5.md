### Intent:
**Intent Summary:**  
Develop an IEC 61131-3 Structured Text program for cascade control of a heat exchanger, where an outer temperature loop sets the flow setpoint for an inner flow loop, with safety checks, output clamping, and emergency handling to maintain stable and safe operation.

### Prompt:
**PID Pressure Control Chemical Reactor:**

Develop a self-contained IEC 61131-3 Structured Text program to implement PID feedback control for regulating the pressure in a chemical reactor. The program should continuously adjust the opening of a pressure control valve based on a setpoint to maintain optimal pressure levels within the reactor.

Include the PID control loop parameters (proportional, integral, and derivative gains) and ensure the logic accounts for pressure deviations from the setpoint. The program should also include safeguards to prevent over-pressurization or under-pressurization by limiting the valveâ€™s operational range. Discuss the critical role of pressure control in chemical reactors, emphasizing safety, process efficiency, and system stability under dynamic reaction conditions.

ðŸŸ© A (Action) â€“ How to Do It
	1.	Measure the reactor pressure (Pressure_PV) and compare it to a setpoint (Pressure_SP := 5.0).
	2.	Calculate the control error and apply the PID algorithm using:
	â€¢	Proportional gain: Kp := 2.0
	â€¢	Integral gain: Ki := 0.8
	â€¢	Derivative gain: Kd := 0.3
	3.	Use a sampling interval of 100 ms to update internal PID variables.
	4.	Clamp the valve output (Valve_Output) within a safe operating range (0.0 to 100.0).
	5.	Store the previous error to compute the derivative in the next cycle.
