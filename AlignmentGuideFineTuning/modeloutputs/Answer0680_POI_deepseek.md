### Intent:
Generate an IEC 61131-3 compliant Sequential Function Chart (SFC) in ASCII art for a traffic light system with timed states (Green:5s, Yellow:2s, Red:5s) using TON timers and cyclic transitions.

### Prompt:
**SFC Traffic Light:**

Create a 61131-3 sequential function chart in ASCII art for a traffic light. Include proper delays for switching the lights.

**R-I-S-E:**

ðŸŸ¥ R (Role) â€“ Define Your Role

Act as a PLC programmer or automation engineer tasked with designing a Sequential Function Chart (SFC) for a traffic light control system using IEC 61131-3 standards in ASCII format.

â¸»

ðŸŸ© I (Input) â€“ Information Provided

You need to design a traffic light cycle with the following features:
	â€¢	Three sequential states: Green, Yellow, and Red
	â€¢	Each light stays on for a fixed duration:
	â€¢	Green: 5 seconds
	â€¢	Yellow: 2 seconds
	â€¢	Red: 5 seconds
	â€¢	Use TON (on-delay) timers to manage timing
	â€¢	The diagram should be presented as ASCII art that visually represents steps, transitions, and timers

â¸»

ðŸŸ§ S (Steps) â€“ Steps to Perform
	1.	Define the SFC structure with three steps (S1: Green, S2: Yellow, S3: Red)
	2.	For each step, assign a TON timer with an appropriate preset time
	3.	Add transitions that are triggered when each timer completes (tGreen.Q, tYellow.Q, tRed.Q)
	4.	Format the steps and transitions using clear ASCII blocks and arrows to represent flow
	5.	Close the cycle by looping the final transition (Red â†’ Green)

â¸»

ðŸŸ¦ E (Expectation) â€“ Expected Outcome

Produce a plain-text Sequential Function Chart that clearly outlines the logic and timing of a traffic light control system. This SFC should be:
	â€¢	Standards-compliant with IEC 61131-3
	â€¢	Readable and understandable in environments without graphics
	â€¢	Useful for PLC implementation, documentation, and training

ðŸŸ¨ S (Solution) â€“ How to Solve

```
Step 1: Define the SFC structure with three steps (S1: Green, S2: Yellow, S3: Red)

S1:
TON(tGreen, 5, 1)

Green ON

S2:
TON(tYellow, 2, 1)

Yellow ON

S3:
TON(tRed, 5, 1)

Red ON

Step 2: Add transitions that are triggered when each timer completes (tGreen.Q, tYellow.Q, tRed.Q)

Green OFF -> Yellow ON (tGreen.Q)

Yellow OFF -> Red ON (tYellow.Q)

Red OFF -> Green ON (tRed.Q)

Step 3: Format the steps and transitions using clear ASCII blocks and arrows to represent flow

```

```
TON(tGreen, 5, 1)

Green ON

```

```
TON(tYellow, 2, 1)

Yellow ON

```

```
TON(tRed, 5, 1)

Red ON

```

```
Green OFF -> Yellow ON (tGreen.Q)

Yellow OFF -> Red ON (tYellow.Q)

Red OFF -> Green ON (tRed.Q)

Step 4: Close the cycle by looping the final transition (Red â†’ Green)
