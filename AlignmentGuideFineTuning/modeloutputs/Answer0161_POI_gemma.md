### Intent:
**Intent Summary:**  
Create an IEC 61131-3 structured text function block to perform precise floating-point comparisons (REAL types) up to a user-defined decimal precision, including error handling and output flags for equality, greater-than, and less-than conditions.

### Prompt:
**Binary Search:**
Implement a self-contained function block in IEC 61131-3 structured text to perform a binary search on an array of 100 integers. Include input validation and efficient handling of search boundaries.

**B-A-B:**

ðŸŸ¥ B (Before) â€“ The Problem or Challenge

Searching through large arrays in PLC-based systems can be inefficient if done linearly, especially in time-sensitive applications like sorting, classification, or threshold detection. Without a structured and optimized approach like binary search, search operations on a 100-element integer array could result in unnecessary CPU cycles, poor performance, and missed response deadlines in industrial control systems.

ðŸŸ© A (After) â€“ The Desired Outcome

Develop a self-contained function block in IEC 61131-3 Structured Text that performs a binary search on a 100-integer array. The function should:
	â€¢	Efficiently locate a target value using binary search logic
	â€¢	Include input validation (e.g., bounds check, sorted array assumption)
	â€¢	Handle search boundaries accurately to avoid indexing errors or infinite loops
	â€¢	Be modular and reusable in PLC programs where fast data lookup is essential

ðŸŸ§ B (Bridge) â€“ How to Get There
	1.	Define the function block interface with inputs for:
	â€¢	SearchArray : ARRAY[1..100] OF INT
	â€¢	TargetValue : INT
	â€¢	Enable : BOOL
	2.	Implement binary search logic using WHILE or REPEAT loops and variables like Low, High, and Mid.
	3.	Add validation to ensure the array index boundaries are respected and the search halts when Low > High or the value is found.
	4.	Include outputs such as:
	â€¢	Found : BOOL
	â€¢	Index : INT (position in array if found, else -1)
	5.	Comment each section for clarity and maintainability.

**B-A-B:**

ðŸŸ¥ B (Before) â€“ The Problem or Challenge

The IEC 61131-3 standard provides a set of programming languages for industrial control systems, including structured text (ST), but it does not include a built-in function for comparing floating-point numbers with a user-defined decimal precision. This can be a challenge for applications that require precise comparisons, such as in process control or robotics, where small differences in values can have significant consequences.

ðŸŸ© A (After) â€“ The Desired Outcome

Create a self-contained function block in IEC 61131-3 structured text that performs precise floating-point comparisons (REAL types) up to a user-defined decimal precision. The function should:
	â€¢	Take two REAL inputs and a precision value as inputs
	â€¢	Compare the two REAL values using the specified precision
	â€¢	Output a BOOL value indicating whether the values are equal, greater than, or less than
	â€¢	Include error handling for invalid inputs or precision values
	â€¢	Be modular and reusable in PLC programs where precise floating-point comparisons are needed

	1.	Define the function block interface with inputs for:
	â€¢	Value1 : REAL
	â€¢	Value2 : REAL
	â€¢	Precision : INT
	2.	Implement the comparison logic using a loop that iterates through the decimal places of the two values, comparing each digit and stopping when the precision is reached.
	3.	Add error handling to check for invalid inputs or precision values and return an error code or flag.
	4.	Include outputs such as:
	â€¢	Equal : BOOL
	â€¢	Greater : BOOL
	â€¢	Less : BOOL
	5.	Comment each section for clarity and maintainability.
