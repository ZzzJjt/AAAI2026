### Intent:
**Intent Summary:**  
Create a recursive-free, scan-cycle-safe quicksort function block in IEC 61131-3 Structured Text to efficiently sort integer arrays in PLCs using an iterative approach with stack-managed subarrays.  

*(Focus: Iterative quicksort for real-time PLCs, avoiding recursion while maintaining efficiency and safety.)*

### Prompt:
**Quicksort:**
Implement a self-contained function block in IEC 61131-3 structured text to perform the quicksort algorithm on an array of integers. Ensure efficient partitioning and recursion handling.

**R-I-S-E:**

ðŸŸ¥ R (Role) â€“ Define Your Role

Act as a PLC developer designing a recursive-free quicksort function block in IEC 61131-3 Structured Text for efficient integer array sorting in real-time control applications.

â¸»

ðŸŸ© I (Input) â€“ Information Provided

You are tasked with implementing a quicksort algorithm that:
	â€¢	Sorts an array of integers
	â€¢	Avoids recursion and the use of unsupported syntax
	â€¢	Is scan-cycle-safe and executable on standard PLCs
	â€¢	Uses an iterative approach with internal stack simulation for managing subarray ranges
	â€¢	Accepts a trigger (Execute) and returns a Done status after sorting

â¸»

ðŸŸ§ S (Steps) â€“ Steps to Perform
	1.	Define the function block with inputs:
	â€¢	InputArray : ARRAY[1..N] OF INT
	â€¢	Execute : BOOL
	2.	Add internal state variables:
	â€¢	StackPointer : INT
	â€¢	Two arrays: LowStack, HighStack for subarray bounds
	â€¢	Pivot, i, j for partitioning
	3.	On Execute = TRUE:
	â€¢	Initialize the stack with the full array bounds
	â€¢	Use a WHILE or REPEAT loop to simulate recursive calls:
	â€¢	Pop a range from the stack
	â€¢	Partition the subarray
	â€¢	Push the resulting left and right subranges (if valid) back onto the stack
	4.	Implement the partition logic (e.g., Lomuto or Hoare scheme) as a subroutine or inline code
	5.	Mark sorting as Done when the stack is empty and all ranges are processed

â¸»

ðŸŸ¦ E (Expectation) â€“ Expected Outcome

Deliver a robust, recursive-free quicksort function block that:
	â€¢	Sorts integer arrays in place using an efficient and well-commented algorithm
	â€¢	Runs safely in a scan-cycle environment without risking stack overflows
	â€¢	Is modular, easy to tune or extend, and reusable across various PLC applications that require real-time data sorting
