### Intent:
The task is to create a reusable timer function block in IEC 61131-3 Structured Text with configurable duration, start/stop controls, and status outputs for precise industrial automation timing operations.

### Prompt:
**Timer:**
Implement a self-contained function block in IEC 61131-3 structured text to create a timer. Include configurable time duration, start/stop controls, and timeout handling.

**R-I-S-E:**

ðŸŸ¥ R (Role) â€“ Define Your Role

Act as a PLC developer creating a flexible and reusable timer function block in IEC 61131-3 Structured Text for use in industrial automation programs.

ðŸŸ© I (Input) â€“ Information Provided

The timer must:
	â€¢	Accept a configurable input PresetTime : TIME
	â€¢	Be controlled with Start and Stop : BOOL inputs
	â€¢	Track elapsed time internally
	â€¢	Output status flags:
	â€¢	Running : BOOL â€” timer is active
	â€¢	Done : BOOL â€” timer reached its preset
	â€¢	RemainingTime : TIME (optional)
	â€¢	Be self-contained, scan-cycle safe, and suitable for ladder logic replacement

â¸»

ðŸŸ§ S (Steps) â€“ Steps to Perform
	1.	Define the function block interface with inputs and outputs as described
	2.	Initialize and manage state:
	â€¢	Detect rising edge of Start
	â€¢	Store the system time as StartTime
	3.	While running:
	â€¢	Continuously calculate ElapsedTime := CURRENT_TIME - StartTime
	â€¢	Set Done := TRUE if ElapsedTime â‰¥ PresetTime
	â€¢	Calculate RemainingTime := PresetTime - ElapsedTime
	4.	On Stop signal:
	â€¢	Reset timer state and output flags
	5.	Use internal variables for state control and accurate tracking
	6.	Include comments to explain timing behavior and guard logic for reliability

â¸»

ðŸŸ¦ E (Expectation) â€“ Expected Outcome

You will deliver a robust, reusable timer function block suitable for precise delays and sequencing operations. It should:
	â€¢	Work accurately across PLC scan cycles
	â€¢	Allow runtime control via Start/Stop inputs
	â€¢	Support easy integration with other logic structures
	â€¢	Help replace standard timers (TON, TP, etc.) with more tailored functionality
