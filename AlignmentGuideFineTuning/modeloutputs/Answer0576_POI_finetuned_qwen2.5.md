### Intent:
**Intent Summary:**  
Develop a feedforward control system in Structured Text that dynamically adjusts the flow rate of Reactant A (Flow_A_Setpoint) based on measured Reactant B flow (Flow_B), concentration (Concentration_B), and temperature (Temperature_B), while compensating for deviations from nominal conditions and enforcing operational limits to maintain a target mixing ratio (Desired_Ratio).  

*(Focus: Ratio control with dynamic compensation for process variability and safety clamping.)*

### Prompt:
**PID Level Control Distillation Column:**

Develop a self-contained IEC 61131-3 Structured Text program to implement PID feedback control for maintaining the liquid level in a distillation column. The control system should adjust the opening of an inlet valve that feeds liquid into the column based on the level setpoint.

The program should incorporate the PID parameters (proportional, integral, and derivative gains) and handle scenarios where the liquid level deviates from the setpoint. Ensure that the logic includes limits on the inlet valve position to prevent overfeeding or underfeeding the column. Discuss the importance of level control in maintaining the efficiency and stability of the distillation process, focusing on response time and control precision under varying operating conditions.

**R-I-S-E:**

ðŸŸ© I (Input) â€“ What Youâ€™re Given
	â€¢	A measured process variable: Level_PV (liquid level in %)
	â€¢	A level setpoint: Level_SP := 60.0 (%)
	â€¢	PID tuning parameters:
	â€¢	Proportional gain Kp := 1.5
	â€¢	Integral gain Ki := 0.4
	â€¢	Derivative gain Kd := 0.2
	â€¢	A 100 ms sample time
	â€¢	Inlet valve output: Valve_Position, which should be clamped between Valve_Min := 0.0 and Valve_Max := 100.0

ðŸŸ§ S (Steps) â€“ What You Need to Do
	1.	Calculate the error between the level setpoint and the measured level:
Error := Level_SP - Level_PV
	2.	Update the integral term using accumulated error over time:
Integral := Integral + Error * 0.1
	3.	Compute the derivative based on the change in error:
Derivative := (Error - Prev_Error) / 0.1
	4.	Calculate the PID output (valve position):
Valve_Position := (Kp * Error) + (Ki * Integral) + (Kd * Derivative)
	5.	Clamp the valve position to prevent overfeeding or underfeeding:
Use IF conditions to restrict it within safe bounds.
	6.	Store the current error for use in the next cycle:
Prev_Error := Error

ðŸŸ¦ E (Expectation) â€“ What Success Looks Like

The final program should:
	â€¢	Maintain the liquid level at the desired setpoint, even under varying process conditions
	â€¢	React promptly to disturbances such as feed flow changes or reflux fluctuations
	â€¢	Prevent flooding or drying of trays by clamping the inlet valve position
	â€¢	Provide a stable, efficient, and safe control solution suitable for real-time execution on a PLC
