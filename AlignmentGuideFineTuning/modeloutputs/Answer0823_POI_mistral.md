### Intent:
The task is to develop an IEC 61131-3 Structured Text program that controls an EtherCAT slave device's state machine, ensuring sequential transitions (INITâ†’PREOPâ†’SAFEOPâ†’OP) with 5-second delays, symbolic state names, and protocol-compliant error handling.  

*(Intent: Generate ST code for EtherCAT state machine control with timed transitions and fault detection.)*

### Prompt:
**EtherCAT State Machine Control Using IEC 61131-3 Structured Text:**

Develop an IEC 61131-3 structured text (ST) program to sequentially transition through all the states of an EtherCAT slave device using the ESM (EtherCAT State Machine) function block. The program should use descriptive state names (such as INIT, PREOP, SAFEOP, OP, etc.) rather than numerical values, ensuring that state transitions occur only when allowed. A 5-second timer delay should be implemented before each state transition to ensure proper timing and stabilization. Discuss the implementation of the EtherCAT state machine, including logic for handling state transitions, error checking, and ensuring compliance with EtherCAT protocol requirements.

**T-A-G:**

ðŸŸ¥ T (Task) â€“ What You Need to Do

Develop an IEC 61131-3 Structured Text (ST) program to control the EtherCAT State Machine (ESM) for a slave device.

ðŸŸ© A (Action) â€“ How to Do It

Write logic that sequentially transitions the slave through the standard EtherCAT states: INIT, PREOP, SAFEOP, and OP. Use symbolic state names instead of numeric values to improve readability. Implement a 5-second timer delay before each transition to ensure stability, and include condition checks to verify that transitions are valid. Incorporate error-handling routines to detect and respond to failed or illegal transitions.

ðŸŸ¦ G (Goal) â€“ What You Want to Achieve

Ensure reliable, protocol-compliant EtherCAT state control with readable, maintainable code that supports safe transitions, proper timing, and real-time fault handling for industrial communication systems.

**Implementation:**

1. Define the EtherCAT states as variables with descriptive names (e.g., `state_INIT`, `state_PREOP`, `state_SAFEOP`, `state_OP`).

```st
VAR_INPUT
  // Inputs

VAR_OUTPUT
  // Outputs

VAR
  // Local variables
  state_current : EtherCAT_State;
  timer_5s     : TON;
  timer_5s_val : TIME;

VAR_CONST
  EtherCAT_State_INIT : EtherCAT_State := 0;
  EtherCAT_State_PREOP : EtherCAT_State := 1;
  EtherCAT_State_SAFEOP : EtherCAT_State := 2;
  EtherCAT_State_OP : EtherCAT_State := 3;
```

2. Initialize the current state to INIT.

```st
state_current := EtherCAT_State_INIT;
```

3. Implement the 5-second timer delay using a timer function block (TON).

```st
timer_5s_val := T#5s;
```

4. Create a function block to check if the timer has expired.

```st
IF timer_5s_expired(timer_5s, timer_5s_val) THEN
  // Timer has expired, perform state transition
END_IF;
```

5. Implement the state transition logic using a CASE statement.

```st
CASE state_current OF
  EtherCAT_State_INIT:
    // Initialization logic
    IF condition_to_transition_to_PREOP THEN
      state_current := EtherCAT_State_PREOP;
      timer_5s := TON_OFF;
    END_IF;

  EtherCAT_State_PREOP:
    // Pre-operation logic
    IF condition_to_transition_to_SAFEOP THEN
      state_current := EtherCAT_State_SAFEOP;
      timer_5s := TON_OFF
