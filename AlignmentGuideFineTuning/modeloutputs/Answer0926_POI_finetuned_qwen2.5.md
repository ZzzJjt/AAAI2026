### Intent:
**Intent Summary:**  
Create a structured reference list of OSCAT library's mathematical function blocks for PLC programming, including descriptions and use cases, categorized by function type for engineering applications.  

**Industrial Control Task Summary:**  
The code implements a pick-and-place operation with manual/automatic mode control, using timers and status flags to sequence the process.  

*(Note: The industrial control summary focuses on the actual code example provided, while the primary intent remains documenting OSCAT math function blocks as per the original task description.)*

### Prompt:
**List Mathematical Function Blocks:**
Compile a detailed list of all mathematical function blocks available in the OSCAT library for PLC programming, including a brief description of their functionality and typical use cases.

**T-A-G:**

ðŸŸ¥ T (Task) â€“ What You Need to Do
