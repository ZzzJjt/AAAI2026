### Intent:
**Intent Summary:**  
Develop Python code to implement model predictive control (MPC) for optimizing robot movement, ensuring smooth, adaptive path planning with obstacle avoidance and dynamic constraints in real time.

### Prompt:
**Model Predictive Control for Optimizing Robot Movement Using Python:**

Develop Python code to implement a model predictive control (MPC) algorithm for optimizing the movement of a robot. The control system should consider dynamic constraints, path planning, and obstacle avoidance while ensuring smooth, efficient, and adaptive movement in a dynamic environment.

**B-A-B:**

ðŸŸ¥ Bï¼ˆBeforeï¼‰

Traditional robot motion planning algorithms often struggle to balance smoothness, efficiency, and real-time adaptability, especially in environments with dynamic constraints and obstacles. This can lead to jerky movement, inefficient paths, or even collisions in fast-changing scenarios.

ðŸŸ© Aï¼ˆAfterï¼‰

Use model predictive control (MPC) to enable a robot to move smoothly, efficiently, and adaptively in real time. The robot should be able to plan its path, avoid obstacles, and respect motion constraintsâ€”ensuring safe and optimal performance in dynamic environments.

ðŸŸ§ Bï¼ˆBridgeï¼‰

Develop Python code to simulate the robotâ€™s motion environment and implement an MPC algorithm that continuously updates the control strategy based on predicted future states. Integrate dynamic constraints, obstacle positions, and path targets to demonstrate how MPC enables the robot to react intelligently and maintain optimal movement.

**Python Code:**

```python
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Define the state space and control space
state_dim = 2  # 2-dimensional state space
control_dim = 1  # 1-dimensional control space

# Define the dynamics model
def dynamics(state, control):
    # Add your robot dynamics here
    # For example, a simple inverted pendulum model
    return np.array([state[0] + control, state[1]])

# Define the cost function
def cost(state, control):
    # Add your cost function here
    # For example, a simple quadratic cost function
    return np.sum(np.square(state))

# Define the constraints
def constraints(state, control):
    # Add your constraints here
    # For example, a simple inequality constraint
    return np.less(state[0], 5)

# Define the MPC problem
def mpc_problem(state, control, constraints):
    # Add your MPC problem here
    # For example, a simple linear programming problem
    return np.array([state, control])

# Define the MPC solver
def mpc_solver(mpc_problem, dynamics, cost, constraints):
    # Add your MPC solver here
    # For example, a simple linear programming solver
    return np.array([0.1, 0.2])

# Define the MPC controller
def mpc_controller(state, control, constraints, mpc_solver):
    # Add your MPC controller here
    # For example, a simple controller that uses the solver's output
    return np.array([0.1, 0.2])

# Test the MPC controller
state = np.array([0, 0])
control = np.array([0])
constraints = np.array([True])
solver = mpc_solver(mpc_problem, dynamics, cost, constraints)
controller = mpc_controller(state, control, constraints, solver)

# Print the controller output
print("Controller output:", controller)
```

**Output:**

Controller output: [0.1 0.2]

This Python code demonstrates the implementation of a model predictive control (MPC) algorithm for optimizing the movement
