ðŸŸ© A (Action) â€“ How to Do It
	1.	Define a function block named MeanStdDevCalculator with the following structure:
	â€¢	Input:
	â€¢	InputArray : ARRAY[1..100] OF INT
	â€¢	Outputs:
	â€¢	Mean : REAL
	â€¢	StdDev : REAL
	2.	Implement the calculation logic:
	â€¢	Mean:
	â€¢	Sum all input values using a REAL accumulator
	â€¢	Divide the total sum by 100.0 to get the average
	â€¢	Standard Deviation:
	â€¢	Loop through the array again, subtracting the mean from each element
	â€¢	Square the difference, accumulate the squared values
	â€¢	Divide the total by 99.0 (sample standard deviation), then apply SQRT
	3.	Add inline comments to explain:
	â€¢	Each step of the calculation
	â€¢	Why REAL is used instead of INT
	â€¢	Why the divisor is 99 (Nâˆ’1)
	â€¢	How this approach ensures deterministic timing for PLC scan cycles
	4.	Address edge cases and system constraints:
	â€¢	Prevent integer overflow by converting to REAL early
	â€¢	Avoid floating-point precision loss
	â€¢	Ensure the function block executes within real-time control limits
