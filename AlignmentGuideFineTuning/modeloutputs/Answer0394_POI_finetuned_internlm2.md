### Intent:
**Intent Summary:**  
Create an ASCII art function block diagram showing an analog input feeding both a timer and PID controller, with the PID output connected to an analog output, for industrial process control documentation.

### Prompt:
**FBD PID:**

Create a 61131-3 function block diagram in ASCII art. It shall contain an analog input, a timer block, and a PID block as well as an analog output. The analog input feeds both the timer and the PID block. Only the PID block is connected to the analog output. Provide typical input and output signals for each function block and show them inside each block.

**C-A-R-E:**

🟥 C (Context) – Background Situation

When designing control systems using IEC 61131-3 Function Block Diagrams (FBD), it’s often helpful to communicate the layout using ASCII art in documentation, code comments, or plain text environments where graphical tools aren’t available. A basic structure involving an analog input, timer, PID controller, and analog output is a common pattern in automation and control logic design.

⸻

🟩 A (Action) – Task to Perform

Create an ASCII-based FBD diagram that includes:
	•	An analog input block
	•	A TON (on-delay) timer block
	•	A PID control block
	•	An analog output block

The analog input should feed both the timer and the PID controller, and only the PID block should be connected to the analog output. Inside each block, show the typical signal names for the inputs and outputs (e.g., IN, ET, PV, SP, CV, OUT, etc.).

⸻

🟨 R (Result) – Expected Outcome

You will produce a text-based representation of a function block diagram that clearly illustrates the signal flow, block interconnections, and naming conventions used in PLC programming. This will help engineers document control strategies, review logic, and share designs without the need for graphics software.

In this example, the analog input (AI) is connected to both the timer (TON) and the PID controller. The timer has an external trigger (ET) and a delay (Q) output. The PID controller has a setpoint (SP) of 50.0 and a process variable (PV) of the input signal. The output of the PID (CV) is connected to the analog output (AO), which receives the control variable (CV) as its input.

🟪 I (Implication) – What It Means

This ASCII FBD diagram provides a clear, text-based representation of a control system with an analog input, a timer, a PID controller, and an analog output. It demonstrates how to document control logic using simple ASCII art, which can be useful in environments where graphical tools are not available or when sharing code snippets in plain text.
