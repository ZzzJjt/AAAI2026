🟩 A (Action) – How to Do It
	1.	Define a function block called SplineInterpolator with:
	•	Inputs:
	•	X : ARRAY[1..N] OF REAL – known x-values
	•	Y : ARRAY[1..N] OF REAL – corresponding y-values
	•	TargetX : REAL – the x-value at which to interpolate
	•	Output:
	•	InterpolatedY : REAL – the result of spline interpolation
	2.	Implement logic to perform cubic spline interpolation:
	•	Identify the correct interval for TargetX between X[i] and X[i+1]
	•	Use precomputed spline coefficients (A[i], B[i], C[i], D[i]) to evaluate:
InterpolatedY = A[i] + B[i](x - X[i]) + C[i](x - X[i])^2 + D[i](x - X[i])^3
	3.	Ensure the implementation is modular:
	•	Coefficients may be computed externally and passed in or initialized once
	•	Runtime logic is optimized for real-time scan cycles
	•	Add comments explaining the math and implementation decisions
	4.	Address challenges:
	•	Handle boundary conditions and extrapolation safely
	•	Use efficient logic for indexing and evaluating the correct segment
	•	Maintain precision without excessive memory or processing overhead

	•	Motion trajectory planning
	•	Sensor data smoothing
	•	Profile-driven process control
	•	Operates predictably and safely within PLC real-time constraints
	•	Is reusable and adaptable to different array sizes and system needs
