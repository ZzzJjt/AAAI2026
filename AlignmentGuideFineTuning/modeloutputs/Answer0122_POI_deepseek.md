ðŸŸ¦ B (Background) â€“ What Is the PID Function Block?

The PID function block in the OSCAT library is a tool for implementing PID control in industrial process control systems. PID stands for Proportional, Integral, Derivative control, and it helps to maintain the desired setpoint of a process variable (e.g., temperature, pressure, flow rate) by adjusting an output (e.g., control valve position, motor speed) in response to deviations from the setpoint.

PID control is widely used in industries such as chemical processing, oil refining, water treatment, and power generation due to its ability to maintain precise control over complex systems that require dynamic adjustments.

ðŸŸ© A (Action) â€“ Inputs and Outputs of the PID Function Block

Inputs:
	1.	PV (Process Variable)
	â€¢	The measured value of the process variable (e.g., current temperature or pressure).
	2.	SP (Setpoint)
	â€¢	The desired target value for the process variable.
	3.	Kp (Proportional Gain)
	â€¢	Controls the response to the current error. A higher Kp increases the output in response to an error.
	4.	Ki (Integral Gain)
	â€¢	Adjusts for accumulated past errors, aiming to eliminate steady-state error over time.
	5.	Kd (Derivative Gain)
	â€¢	Reacts to the rate of change of the error, helping to reduce overshoot and oscillations.
	6.	Setpoint deviation (error)
	â€¢	The difference between the SP and the PV, calculated to determine the corrective output.
	7.	Time-related parameters
	â€¢	Include parameters like the sampling time (e.g., dt) and limits for output.

Outputs:
	1.	Control Output
	â€¢	The adjusted output signal that drives the actuator, such as the valve position or motor speed.
	2.	Error (e)
	â€¢	Represents the difference between the Setpoint (SP) and the Process Variable (PV), which is used for calculation in the PID loop.
	3.	Saturation Flags
	â€¢	Indicators for whether the output has reached its limits.

ðŸŸ© A (Action) â€“ Example Implementation

Consider a simple example of a PID function block controlling a process variable (e.g., temperature) via a control valve.

1.	PV: Current temperature (e.g., 50Â°C)
2.	SP: Desired temperature (e.g., 50Â°C)
3.	Kp: Proportional gain (e.g., 0.1)
4.	Ki: Integral gain (e.g., 0.01)
5.	Kd: Derivative gain (e.g., 0.01)
6.	Sampling time (e.g., 0.1 seconds)

The PID function block calculates the error (SP - PV) and adjusts the control output accordingly. The control output is the difference between the desired setpoint and the current process variable.

For example, if the current temperature is 50Â°C, and the setpoint is 50Â°C, the error would be 0, and the control output would be 0. If the temperature increases to 55Â°C, the error would be 5, and the control output would be 5.

The PID function block would then adjust the control output based on the error and the gains specified. The control output would be adjusted to reduce the error, and the process would continue until the error is minimized or the setpoint is reached.
