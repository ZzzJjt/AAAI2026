### Intent:
**Intent Summary:**  
Create an IEC 61131-3 Structured Text program to regulate pneumatic airflow at 50 SLPM while maintaining pressure between 5.5â€“6.0 bar, with safety checks for deviations and deterministic 100 ms control cycles.  

*(Focus: Real-time flow/pressure control with fault handling in a PLC.)*

### Prompt:
**Pneumatic System Control Using 61131-3 Structured Text:**

Write a self-contained 61131-3 structured text program (not a function block) to control a pneumatic system with a control loop frequency of 100 ms. The system should regulate the flow of air to actuators based on input signals, maintaining a flow rate of 50 standard liters per minute. The system must also ensure that the pressure remains within the specified range of 5.5 to 6 bar. Implement safety checks to handle any deviations in flow or pressure and ensure efficient and reliable operation under varying load conditions.

**R-I-S-E:**

ðŸŸ¥ R (Role) â€“ Your Role

ðŸŸ© I (Input) â€“ What Youâ€™re Given
	â€¢	Control loop frequency: 100 ms (program should update every 0.1 seconds)
	â€¢	Target flow rate: 50 standard liters per minute (SLPM)
	â€¢	Pressure operating range: 5.5 to 6.0 bar
	â€¢	Sensor inputs:
	â€¢	FlowInput (REAL): Current flow rate
	â€¢	PressureInput (REAL): Current pressure
	â€¢	Actuator outputs:
	â€¢	FlowValveOutput (BOOL): Controls air valve
	â€¢	PressureReliefValve (BOOL): Activates if pressure is out of bounds
	â€¢	Safety conditions:
	â€¢	Trigger alerts or actuator shutdowns if pressure or flow deviate from desired range

â¸»

ðŸŸ§ S (Steps) â€“ What You Need to Do
	1.	Calculate Flow Control Logic:
	â€¢	If FlowInput < 50.0 SLPM, open FlowValveOutput
	â€¢	Else, close it to maintain or reduce flow
	2.	Check Pressure Safety Range:
	â€¢	If PressureInput < 5.5 bar or > 6.0 bar, set PressureError := TRUE and open PressureReliefValve
	â€¢	Otherwise, keep valve closed and clear the fault flag
	3.	Monitor Flow Deviation:
	â€¢	If ABS(FlowInput - FlowSetpoint) > 5.0, raise FlowError := TRUE
	â€¢	Else, set FlowError := FALSE
	4.	Ensure program executes deterministically within 100 ms cycle time
	â€¢	Avoid excessive computation or nested delays

â¸»

ðŸŸ¦ E (Expectation) â€“ What Success Looks Like

Your final program will:
	â€¢	Stably regulate flow around 50 SLPM
	â€¢	Protect equipment by responding to over/under-pressure events
	â€¢	Set FlowError and PressureError flags for diagnostics and alarming
	â€¢	Be modular, clear, and suitable for use in real-time industrial automation
	â€¢	Allow for future upgrades like PID control, data logging, or remote HMI integration

ðŸŸ¨ C (Conclusion) â€“ What to Do Next

After implementing the above steps, test the program with various load conditions to ensure it maintains stable flow and pressure within the desired range. If necessary, adjust the flow setpoint, pressure limits, or safety thresholds to achieve optimal performance. Document the program's functionality and any necessary maintenance procedures.

Finally, integrate the program into the overall pneumatic system, ensuring proper communication with other components and safety measures. Monitor the system's performance and make any necessary adjustments to the program or system configuration to maintain optimal performance and safety.
