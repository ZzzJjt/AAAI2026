### Intent:
**Intent Summary:**  
Develop an IEC 61131-3 Structured Text PLC program to safely control an automatic car wash station, ensuring the wash process only runs when a car is present and no humans are detected, with immediate shutdown and alarm activation if a human enters the wash area.  

*(Focus: Safety prioritization, sensor monitoring, and process interruption logic.)*

### Prompt:
**Automatic Car Wash Station Control Using 61131-3 Structured Text:**

Write a PLC program in structured text (ST) according to IEC 61131-3 standards to control an automatic car wash station with a single wash bay. The system should use a sensor to detect the presence of a car. Once the car is detected and no human is present in the wash area, the system should initiate the car wash process. If a human is detected within the car wash area at any point, the station should immediately stop the wash process, trigger an alarm, and remain in a safe state until the area is clear.

**R-I-S-E:**

ðŸŸ¥ R (Role) â€“ Your Role

You are a PLC programmer tasked with developing a safe and efficient control system for an automatic car wash station using IEC 61131-3 Structured Text (ST). Your objective is to ensure the wash cycle operates only under safe conditions and immediately halts in case of human presence.

â¸»

ðŸŸ© I (Input) â€“ What Youâ€™re Given

You are provided with the following system components:
	â€¢	Sensors:
	â€¢	CarPresentSensor : BOOL â€” TRUE when a car is inside the wash bay
	â€¢	HumanDetectedSensor : BOOL â€” TRUE when a person is detected inside the bay
	â€¢	Outputs to control:
	â€¢	WashActive : BOOL â€” TRUE when the wash process is running
	â€¢	AlarmActive : BOOL â€” TRUE when a human is detected during wash operation
	â€¢	SafeToRun : BOOL â€” internal flag to lock/unlock wash permission based on safety state

â¸»

ðŸŸ§ S (Steps) â€“ What You Need to Do
	1.	Monitor the sensors each scan cycle:
	â€¢	Continuously check the presence of a car (CarPresentSensor)
	â€¢	Continuously check for human detection (HumanDetectedSensor)
	2.	Develop the control logic using structured text:
	â€¢	If a human is detected at any time, stop the wash (WashActive := FALSE), set the alarm (AlarmActive := TRUE), and disable further operation (SafeToRun := FALSE)
	â€¢	If a car is present, no human is detected, and SafeToRun = TRUE, allow the wash to start
	â€¢	Once the area is clear and the wash is inactive, reset SafeToRun to TRUE to enable a new cycle
	3.	Document each condition clearly with comments explaining:
	â€¢	The priority of human safety
	â€¢	Why the wash process must lock after a safety breach
	â€¢	How SafeToRun prevents immediate unsafe restarts

â¸»

ðŸŸ¦ E (Expectation) â€“ What Success Looks Like

You will have implemented a reliable and safe car wash controller that:
	â€¢	Starts washing only when a car is detected and no person is present
	â€¢	Instantly halts and alarms when a person enters during the cycle
	â€¢	Locks out the system until the area is verified clear and wash is idle
	â€¢	Can be easily integrated with HMI displays, safety relays, and alarm beacons
	â€¢	Follows structured and maintainable logic written according to IEC 61131-3 ST standards

**Structured Text Program:**

```structuredtext
PROGRAM CarWashControl
VAR
    CarPresentSensor : BOOL;
    HumanDetectedSensor : BOOL;
    WashActive : BOOL;
    AlarmActive : BOOL;
    SafeToRun : BOOL;
END_VAR

// Initialize SafeToRun to allow the first cycle
SafeToRun := TRUE;

// Main control loop
WHILE TRUE DO
    // Check for human presence
    IF HumanDetectedSensor THEN
        // If a human is detected, stop the wash, activate the alarm, and lock the system
        WashActive := FALSE;
        AlarmActive := TRUE;
        SafeToRun := FALSE;
    ELSE
        // If no human is detected, check for car presence
        IF CarPresentSensor AND SafeToRun THEN
            // If a car is present and it's safe to run, start the wash
            WashActive := TRUE;
            AlarmActive := FALSE;
        END_IF;
    END_IF;
    
    // Wait for the next scan cycle
    SLEEP(100); // Adjust the sleep time based on your PLC's scan rate
END_WHILE;
END_PROGRAM
```

This structured text program ensures that the car wash station operates safely, with immediate shutdown and alarm activation in case of human presence. The `SafeToRun` flag is crucial for preventing the system from restarting the wash process until the area is clear and safe.
