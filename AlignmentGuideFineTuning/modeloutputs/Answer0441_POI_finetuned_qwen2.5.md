### Intent:
The task involves creating a Structured Text function block to dynamically register or deregister CANOpen PDOs (Process Data Objects) based on COBID values, with additional functionality to clear all registrations and buffer messages when specified, while ensuring robust error handling and network communication management.  

**Intent Summary:**  
*"Implement a CANOpen PDO registration manager in ST that handles dynamic COBID registration/deregistration with buffer clearing capability and error handling."*

### Prompt:
**CANOpen PDO Registration Using 61131-3 Structured Text:**

Develop a structured text (ST) function block named CAN_REGISTER_COBID based on IEC 61131 standards. The block will be responsible for registering or deleting a PDO (Process Data Object) or CAN Layer 2 message for reception by the network layer. When the REGISTER input is set to TRUE, the specified COBID (CAN identifier) will be registered for receiving messages. If REGISTER is set to FALSE, the registration of the respective COBID will be deleted. Additionally, when REGISTER is FALSE and COBID is set to 0, all registrations and messages stored in the network layer buffer will be cleared. Discuss the function blockâ€™s implementation, including error handling, network communication management, and memory buffer clearing mechanisms.

**R-I-S-E:**

ðŸŸ¥ R (Role) â€“ Your Position

Act as an industrial automation engineer developing reusable function blocks in Structured Text (ST) under IEC 61131-3 standards for CANOpen-based communication systems.

ðŸŸ© I (Input) â€“ What Youâ€™re Given

You need to implement a function block called CAN_REGISTER_COBID. This block must handle the registration and deregistration of Process Data Objects (PDOs) or CAN Layer 2 messages. When the REGISTER input is set to TRUE, the given COBID is registered to receive messages. When REGISTER is FALSE, that COBID is deregistered. Additionally, if REGISTER = FALSE and COBID = 0, all registrations and buffered messages in the network layer should be cleared.

ðŸŸ§ S (Steps) â€“ What to Do
	1.	Define the CAN_REGISTER_COBID function block interface with inputs: COBID (DWORD), REGISTER (BOOL), and appropriate status outputs.
	2.	Implement logic to register or deregister the COBID from the reception buffer depending on the value of REGISTER.
	3.	Add a special condition: if REGISTER = FALSE and COBID = 0, clear all current registrations and the buffer memory.
	4.	Incorporate error handling for invalid COBIDs, duplicate registrations, and internal faults, using output status codes or flags.
	5.	Ensure the function block can be reused reliably in different contexts with varying communication needs.

ðŸŸ¦ E (Expectation) â€“ What Success Looks Like

The final function block should allow flexible and safe dynamic registration of CANOpen messages, improve communication efficiency, and simplify buffer management. It should support network reconfiguration during runtime while offering robust error handling and predictable behavior during process transitions or resets.
