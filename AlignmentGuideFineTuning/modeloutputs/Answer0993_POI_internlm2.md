**Control Narrative for Ethanol Production**

**1. Introduction**

Ethanol production is a complex process that involves several stages, including fermentation. The fermentation stage is critical for producing high-quality ethanol with a high yield. This control narrative aims to provide a structured and detailed explanation of the fermentation stage, including the control objectives, setpoints, control methods, and safety logic for key parameters.

**2. Fermentation Stage Overview**

The fermentation stage is the process of converting sugars into ethanol and carbon dioxide using yeast. The process involves several steps, including inoculation, temperature control, pH adjustment, agitation, and foam control.

**3. Fermentation Control**

**3.1 Inoculation**

The inoculation step involves adding yeast to the fermentation vessel. The objective is to ensure that the yeast is evenly distributed throughout the vessel. The setpoint for the inoculation step is to add the yeast at a specific volume rate. The control method is to use a peristaltic pump to add the yeast at a constant rate. The feedback sensor used is a flow meter to ensure that the yeast is added at the correct rate. The interlock used is a high-level alarm to stop the inoculation if the yeast is not added at the correct rate.

**3.2 Temperature Control**

The temperature control step is critical for ensuring that the yeast is active and producing ethanol. The objective is to maintain the temperature within a specific range. The setpoint for the temperature control step is to maintain the temperature between 32 and 35 degrees Celsius. The control method is to use a PID controller to adjust the temperature based on the feedback from a temperature sensor. The feedback sensor used is a temperature sensor to measure the actual temperature. The interlock used is a high-level alarm to stop the fermentation if the temperature goes outside the setpoint range.

**3.3 pH Adjustment**

The pH adjustment step is critical for ensuring that the yeast is active and producing ethanol. The objective is to maintain the pH within a specific range. The setpoint for the pH adjustment step is to maintain the pH between 4.5 and 5.0. The control method is to use a pH controller to adjust the pH based on the feedback from a pH sensor. The feedback sensor used is a pH sensor to measure the actual pH. The interlock used is a high-level alarm to stop the fermentation if the pH goes outside the setpoint range.

**3.4 Agitation**
