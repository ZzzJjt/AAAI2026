ðŸŸ© A (Action) â€“ How It Works
	1.	Inputs:
	â€¢	SP (Setpoint): The desired target value of the process (e.g., 75Â°C).
	â€¢	PV (Process Variable): The actual measured value (e.g., current temperature).
	â€¢	Kp, Ki, Kd: Tuning constants that define proportional, integral, and derivative behavior.
	â€¢	Optional: MANUAL mode for overriding automatic control, and LIMIT_HI / LIMIT_LO for output clamping.
	2.	Processing:
	â€¢	Computes Error := SP - PV.
	â€¢	Calculates:
	â€¢	Proportional Term: Kp * error
	â€¢	Integral Term: Ki * âˆ« error dt (to remove steady-state offset)
	â€¢	Derivative Term: Kd * d(error)/dt (to dampen sudden changes)
	â€¢	Combines these to form the control signal (OUT), with output limiting and anti-windup protection.
	3.	Outputs:
	â€¢	OUT: The control signal to the actuator (e.g., valve position, motor speed).
	â€¢	ERROR: Real-time deviation between SP and PV.
	â€¢	Status flags: Such as saturation indicators (if limits are reached).

ðŸŸ¦ R (Reasoning) â€“ Why It Matters

The PID function block is a fundamental building block in process control systems, as it allows for the automatic regulation of a process variable to a desired setpoint. By using the PID algorithm, engineers can minimize overshoot, reduce steady-state error, and improve overall system stability. This leads to increased efficiency, reduced waste, and improved product quality in various industrial applications.

ðŸŸ¦ E (Examples) â€“ How It's Used

1.	In a urea synthesis reactor, the PID function block could be used to control the temperature by adjusting the cooling water flow rate based on the measured reactor temperature.
2.	In a chemical dosing system, the PID function block could be used to maintain a constant pH level by controlling the flow rate of an acid or base solution.
3.	In a HVAC system, the PID function block could be used to regulate the room temperature by adjusting the fan speed or heating/cooling output.
4.	In a water treatment plant, the PID function block could be used to control the chlorine dosage based on the measured residual chlorine level.
