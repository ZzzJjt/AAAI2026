### Intent:
**Intent Summary:**  
Develop an IEC 61131-3 Structured Text program to implement feedforward control for a conveyor belt, adjusting its speed proactively based on predicted load input (via sensor data) to optimize efficiency and prevent overloading/underloading, while adhering to operational speed limits.

### Prompt:
**Feedforward Control Conveyor:**

Develop a self-contained IEC 61131-3 Structured Text program (not a function block) to implement feedforward control for adjusting the speed of a conveyor belt based on sensor-predicted load changes. The program should use input from sensors that predict the weight or volume of material entering the conveyor system, allowing for real-time adjustments to the belt speed before a load change occurs.

Include logic that calculates the required conveyor speed based on the predicted load and adjusts the motor speed accordingly, ensuring that the conveyor operates efficiently without overloading or underloading. Discuss the benefits of feedforward control in conveyor systems, particularly in reducing delays and improving response times compared to feedback-only control strategies.

Feedforward control is a proactive control strategy that anticipates the effect of a control action on the system output. In the context of conveyor systems, feedforward control can be used to adjust the conveyor speed based on predicted load input, allowing for proactive adjustments before a load change occurs.

The benefits of feedforward control in conveyor systems include:
	â€¢	Faster response times: By anticipating load changes, feedforward control can adjust the conveyor speed before a load change occurs, reducing delays and improving response times.
	â€¢	Improved efficiency: By optimizing conveyor speed based on predicted load, feedforward control can prevent overloading or underloading, maintaining optimal flow and system efficiency.
	â€¢	Reduced system wear: By preventing jams and underloads, feedforward control can reduce the strain on conveyor components, extending their lifespan and reducing maintenance costs.
