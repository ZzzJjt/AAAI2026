Develop a non-linear model-predictive controller (NMPC) in Python to optimize the startup process of a steam generator in a power plant. The NMPC should be designed to handle the non-linear dynamics of the steam generation process, considering key variables such as pressure, temperature, and flow rates.

Starting up a steam generator in a power plant is a complex task involving non-linear interactions between variables like temperature, pressure, and flow rate.

To develop a non-linear model-predictive controller (NMPC) for optimizing the startup of a steam generator in a power plant, we will follow a structured approach. This involves building a dynamic model of the steam generator, designing the NMPC framework, implementing the controller in Python, and validating its performance. Below is a detailed step-by-step guide:

### Step 1: Build a Non-Linear Dynamic Model of the Steam Generator

The steam generator can be modeled using a set of differential equations that describe the dynamics of pressure, temperature, and flow rate. For simplicity, let's assume the following simplified model:

\[ \frac{dP}{dt} = \frac{Q_{in} - Q_{out}}{V} \]
\[ \frac{dT}{dt} = \frac{Q_{in} - Q_{out}}{C_p V} \]
\[ \frac{dQ_{out}}{dt} = \frac{P_{out} - P_{in}}{R} \]

Where:
- \( P \) is the pressure.
- \( T \) is the temperature.
- \( Q_{in} \) is the input flow rate.
- \( Q_{out} \) is the output flow rate.
- \( V \) is the volume.
- \( C_p \) is the specific heat capacity.
- \( R \) is the resistance.

### Step 2: Design the NMPC Framework

The NMPC framework consists of:
- **Prediction Model**: A model that predicts the future states of the system based on current inputs.
- **Finite Control Horizon**: A fixed number of future time steps over which the optimization is performed.
- **Objective Function**: A function that defines the goal of the optimization (e.g., minimize startup time).
- **Constraints**: Safety and operational constraints that must be satisfied.

### Step 3: Implement the NMPC in Python

We will create a modular Python implementation with the following files:
- `model.py`: Contains the dynamic model of the steam generator.
- `controller.py`: Implements the NMPC algorithm.
- `main.py`: Runs the simulation and visualizes the results.

#### model.py

```python
import numpy as np

class SteamGeneratorModel:
    def __init__(self, V, C_p, R):
        self.V = V
        self.C_p = C_p
        self.R = R

    def dynamics(self, t, state, inputs):
        P, T, Q_out
