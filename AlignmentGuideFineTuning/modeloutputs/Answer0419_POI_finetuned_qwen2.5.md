### Prompt:
**Model Predictive Control for Wind Farm Optimization Using C++:**

Develop C++ code to implement a model predictive control (MPC) algorithm to optimize the operation of a wind farm. The control system should consider factors such as wind speed variability, turbine dynamics, and power output efficiency. It should also ensure grid stability while accounting for constraints on turbine operation, energy storage, and power dispatch under fluctuating environmental conditions.

Implement C++ code to simulate the wind farmâ€™s operational dynamics and demonstrate the effectiveness of the MPC in managing real-time power generation and distribution.

Before You Begin

	â€¢	B (Before) â€“ The Background Situation

Wind farms operate in highly variable environments, where wind speed and direction can fluctuate rapidly.
