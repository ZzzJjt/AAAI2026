### Intent:
The task is to generate a structured textual Piping and Instrumentation Diagram (P&ID) for a power plant steam-water cycle, including equipment, instrumentation, control loops with concrete tag names, and piping connections, to serve as a non-graphical process documentation tool.

### Prompt:
**P-ID Steam Water Cycle:**

Create a P&I diagram in textual notation for a steam water cycle in a power plant. Include equipment, instrumentation, piping, and control loops. Provide concrete tag names.

**C-A-R-E:**

🟥 C (Context) – Background Situation

In power plant engineering, the steam-water cycle is a critical process that involves feedwater supply, steam generation, energy transfer, and condensate recovery. Typically, this system is documented using graphical Piping and Instrumentation Diagrams (P&IDs). However, in environments where visual tools aren’t available—such as early-stage design, textual documentation, or version-controlled environments—engineers often rely on structured textual notation to convey the same information effectively.

⸻

🟩 A (Action) – Task to Perform

Create a text-based P&ID for a steam-water cycle that includes:
	•	Process equipment (e.g., boiler, steam drum, feedwater pump, condenser)
	•	Instrumentation (e.g., pressure transmitters, level controllers, flow elements)
	•	Control loops with concrete tag names (e.g., FT101, FCV102, LT103)
	•	Piping flow paths clearly represented using arrows (-->) and structured indentation

Ensure the layout clearly communicates the relationship between instruments, control logic, and equipment within the system.

⸻

🟨 R (Result) – Expected Outcome

The result will be a readable, logically sequenced P&ID in textual format, suitable for:
	•	Early-stage design discussions
	•	Control narrative development
	•	Integration with PLC or DCS logic
	•	Documenting control loop structure for cross-disciplinary teams

It will serve as a bridge between process design and automation, even in environments where graphical diagrams are not practical.

C01  --> Pump P02 --> Feedwater Tank T01
T01  --> FT201 --> FIC201 --> FCV201

In this example, P01 represents the boiler, and the arrows represent the flow of steam and condensate. FT101, FCV101, LT102, and FCV201 are control loops with concrete tag names.

⸻

🟪 R (Recommendation) – How to Proceed

To create the P&ID, follow these steps:
	1. Identify the major equipment and control loops in the steam-water cycle.
	2. Assign concrete tag names to each control loop.
	3. Organize the equipment and control loops in a logical sequence.
	4. Use arrows and indentation to represent the flow of steam and condensate.
	5. Ensure the P&ID is easy to read and understand, even for cross-disciplinary teams.

By following these steps, you will create a structured textual P&ID that effectively communicates the steam-water cycle process.
