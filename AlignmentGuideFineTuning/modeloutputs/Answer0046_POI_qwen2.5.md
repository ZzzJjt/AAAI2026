### Intent:
**Intent Summary:**  
Develop an IEC 61131-3 Structured Text program to automatically close a vessel's inlet valve when the liquid level exceeds a high setpoint, maintain the interlock until the level drops below a reset threshold, and enforce fail-safe actions for sensor/valve faults to prevent overfilling.

### Prompt:
**Interlock Overfill Protection:**

Develop a self-contained IEC 61131-3 Structured Text program to implement an interlock system for overfill protection of a vessel. The program should utilize a level sensor to monitor the liquid level in the vessel and control an inlet valve to prevent overfilling.

The logic should ensure that the inlet valve automatically closes when the level sensor detects that the liquid has reached a predefined high-level setpoint. The interlock should remain engaged until the level drops below a safe threshold. Additionally, include a fail-safe mechanism to handle sensor failure or valve malfunction, ensuring the system defaults to a safe state. Discuss the importance of interlocks in industrial process safety and the role of overfill protection in preventing hazardous conditions.

**B-A-B:**

ðŸŸ¥ B (Before) â€“ The Challenge

In many industrial processes, uncontrolled vessel overfilling can lead to dangerous spills, environmental damage, equipment failure, or even fire and explosion hazards. Without an automatic protection mechanism, operators may not react in time to high-level conditions or instrumentation faults. Manual intervention alone is not always reliable, especially in unattended or fast-filling operations.

ðŸŸ© A (After) â€“ The Ideal Outcome

Develop a self-contained IEC 61131-3 Structured Text program that performs automatic overfill protection for a process vessel. The system should:
	â€¢	Continuously monitor the liquid level using a level sensor.
	â€¢	Automatically close the inlet valve (e.g., INLET_VALVE := FALSE) when the level reaches a predefined high-level setpoint.
	â€¢	Keep the valve closed until the level drops below a safe lower reset threshold, avoiding valve chattering.
	â€¢	Include a fail-safe mechanism that:
	â€¢	Closes the inlet valve if the level sensor fails (e.g., stuck signal or sensor offline).
	â€¢	Defaults to a safe state in the event of valve malfunction.

This logic ensures that the system proactively responds to overfill risks and maintains safe operation without requiring manual input under fault conditions.

ðŸŸ§ B (Bridge) â€“ The Implementation Strategy

To build this interlock system:
	1.	Define input variables for the level signal, fault detection, and valve status.
	2.	Use conditional logic to monitor for high-level conditions:

 IF LevelSensor > HIGH_SETPOINT THEN
    INLET_VALVE := FALSE;
    SHUTDOWN_LATCH := TRUE;
END_IF;

IF SHUTDOWN_LATCH AND LevelSensor < RESET_THRESHOLD THEN
    SHUTDOWN_LATCH := FALSE;
END_IF;

IF SensorFault OR ValveFault THEN
    INLET_VALVE := FALSE; // Fail-safe action
END_IF;

	3.	Implement latching logic to maintain interlock status until reset conditions are met.
	4.	Include manual override protections only with supervisory control and alarm acknowledgment.

Finally, explain how overfill interlocks are critical to process safety, asset protection, and regulatory compliance, particularly in chemical, pharmaceutical, and oil & gas industries.

**IEC 61131-3 Structured Text Program for Overfill Protection:**

```structuredtext
PROGRAM OverfillProtection
VAR
    LevelSensor : REAL; // Input variable for level sensor signal
    HIGH_SETPOINT : REAL := 80.0; // High-level setpoint in percentage
    RESET_THRESHOLD : REAL := 70.0; // Reset threshold in percentage
    INLET_VALVE : BOOL := TRUE; // Output variable for inlet valve status
    SHUTDOWN_LATCH : BOOL := FALSE; // Latch for interlock status
    SensorFault : BOOL := FALSE; // Input variable for sensor fault detection
    ValveFault : BOOL := FALSE; // Input variable for valve fault detection
END_VAR

// Main logic for overfill protection
IF LevelSensor > HIGH_SETPOINT AND NOT SHUTDOWN_LATCH THEN
    INLET_VALVE := FALSE;
    SHUTDOWN_LATCH := TRUE;
END_IF;

IF SHUTDOWN_LATCH AND LevelSensor < RESET_THRESHOLD THEN
    SHUTDOWN_LATCH := FALSE;
END_IF;

// Fail-safe mechanism for sensor and valve faults
IF SensorFault OR ValveFault THEN
    INLET_VALVE := FALSE; // Close the inlet valve in case of fault
END_IF;
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Input Variables:**
   - `LevelSensor`: The input variable for the level sensor signal.
   - `HIGH_SETPOINT`: The high-level setpoint in percentage.
   - `RESET_THRESHOLD`: The reset threshold in percentage.
   - `INLET_VALVE`: The output variable for the inlet valve status.
   - `SHUTDOWN_LATCH`: A latch variable to maintain the interlock status.
   - `SensorFault`: An input variable for sensor fault detection.
   - `ValveFault`: An input variable for valve fault detection.

2. **Main Logic:**
   - The program checks if the `LevelSensor` exceeds the `HIGH_SETPOINT` and the `SHUTDOWN_LATCH` is not already set. If both conditions are met, it sets the `INLET_VALVE` to `FALSE` and sets the `SHUTDOWN_LATCH` to `TRUE`.
   - If the `SHUTDOWN_LATCH` is set and the `LevelSensor` drops below the `RESET_THRESHOLD`, the `SHUTDOWN_LATCH` is reset
