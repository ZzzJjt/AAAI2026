### Intent:
The task is to create an IEC 61131-3 structured text function block that establishes an OPC UA subscription by interfacing with external C-code, handling subscription parameters, error checking, and lifecycle management for real-time industrial data monitoring.

### Prompt:
**Ethernet PowerLink Diagnostics Using IEC 61131-3 Structured Text:**

Develop a function block in structured text (ST) based on IEC 61131 standards to retrieve Ethernet PowerLink diagnostic information from a control node device via a PowerLink managing node (MN). The function block should collect and display key diagnostic data such as communication status, error codes, and node health. The program must ensure that the diagnostic information is accurately processed and relayed to the controller for further analysis. Discuss how the function block interacts with the PowerLink network, handles error detection, and provides real-time diagnostics for maintaining network integrity.

**B-A-B:**

ðŸŸ¥ B (Before) â€“ The Challenge

In Ethernet PowerLink-based industrial networks, monitoring communication health is critical. However, without a dedicated diagnostic function, retrieving and interpreting diagnostic dataâ€”such as error codes, communication failures, or node statusâ€”can be difficult, delayed, and error-prone. This lack of real-time visibility makes troubleshooting and network maintenance inefficient.

ðŸŸ© A (After) â€“ The Ideal Outcome

Develop a Structured Text (ST) function block, compliant with IEC 61131 standards, that communicates with a PowerLink Managing Node (MN) to retrieve diagnostic data from connected control nodes. The function block should provide real-time access to key information such as communication status, error codes, and node health, making it available to the controller for analysis and system-level decision-making.

ðŸŸ§ B (Bridge) â€“ The Implementation Strategy

Design the function block to interface with the PowerLink MN using defined service or diagnostic channels. Implement logic to cyclically poll diagnostic registers, parse status codes, and identify node-level issues such as timeouts, offline states, or internal faults. Include mechanisms for error detection and structured output formatting, so that the controller or operator interface can clearly display the health of each nodeâ€”supporting quick diagnostics, faster fault resolution, and improved network reliability.

**C (Circumstances) â€“ The Context:**

Ethernet PowerLink is a real-time, deterministic communication protocol for industrial automation networks. It provides high-speed, reliable data exchange between control nodes, enabling real-time monitoring and control of industrial processes. However, without proper diagnostic tools, troubleshooting and maintaining network integrity can be challenging. Develop a function block in IEC 61131-3 Structured Text to retrieve diagnostic information from a PowerLink managing node, providing real-time visibility into the health of connected control nodes.

**R (Rationale) â€“ The Reasoning:**

Developing a function block to retrieve diagnostic information from a PowerLink network is essential for maintaining network integrity and ensuring real-time visibility into the health of connected nodes. By implementing a self-contained diagnostic function, you can provide a structured and reliable way to monitor the status of each node, enabling faster troubleshooting and more efficient network maintenance.

**E (Example) â€“ The Execution:**

Develop a function block in IEC 61131-3 Structured Text that retrieves diagnostic information from a PowerLink managing node. The function block should include logic to poll diagnostic registers, parse status codes, and format the output for easy interpretation by the controller or operator interface. Ensure that the function block handles error detection and provides clear, real-time visibility into the health of connected control nodes.

**T (Tips) â€“ The Key Points:**
