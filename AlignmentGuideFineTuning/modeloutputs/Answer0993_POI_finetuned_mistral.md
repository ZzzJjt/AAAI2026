**T-A-G:**

ðŸŸ¥ T (Task)

Develop a control narrative for an ethanol production process, with emphasis on the fermentation phase, including all critical parameters and automation logic.

â¸»

ðŸŸ© A (Action)
	â€¢	Specify concrete setpoints and ranges for key fermentation variables such as temperature (e.g., 32â€“35â€¯Â°C), pH (e.g., 4.5â€“5.0), and agitation speed.
	â€¢	Break Section 3: Fermentation into logical subsections (e.g., 3.1 Inoculation, 3.2 Temperature Control, 3.3 pH Adjustment, 3.4 Agitation, 3.5 Foam Control).
	â€¢	For each subsection, write one paragraph that describes:
	â€¢	The control objective
	â€¢	Setpoints or control bands
	â€¢	The control method (e.g., PID, on/off logic)
	â€¢	Any feedback sensors, interlocks, or alarm thresholds used to ensure safe and stable operation

â¸»

ðŸŸ¦ G (Goal)

Deliver a structured, detailed, and implementation-ready control narrative that helps automation engineers, operators, and system integrators understand how the fermentation stage is controlled, why it matters, and how the system should respond to deviationsâ€”ensuring safe, high-yield ethanol production.

### Ethanol Production Control Narrative

#### 1. Introduction
This control narrative describes the automation logic for the ethanol production process, with a focus on the fermentation phase. The narrative provides detailed control strategies, setpoints, and logic for key parameters such as temperature, pH, agitation, foam control, and product transfer. It ensures safe, efficient, and consistent operation of the ethanol production system.

#### 2. Process Overview
The ethanol production process consists of the following stages:
- Raw Material Preparation
- Saccharification
- Fermentation
- Distillation
- Dehydration
- Product Storage

This narrative focuses on the Fermentation phase, which involves controlling the fermenter to maintain optimal conditions for yeast growth and ethanol production.

#### 3. Fermentation Phase

##### 3.1 Inoculation

###### Objective
Inoculate the fermenter with a consistent amount of yeast culture to ensure efficient fermentation.

###### Setpoint
- Yeast concentration: 100 billion cells/mL

###### Control Method
- Add yeast culture to the fermenter using a calibrated dosing pump.
- Measure yeast concentration using a cell counter.
- Adjust dosing rate as needed to reach the setpoint.

###### Safety and Alarm Logic
- If yeast concentration falls below 90 billion cells/mL, trigger an alarm and pause fermentation until the issue is resolved.

##### 3.2 Temperature Control

###### Objective
Maintain a consistent fermentation temperature to support yeast growth and ethanol production.

###### Setpoint
- Temperature: 32â€“35Â°C

###### Control Method
- Use a PID controller to regulate the temperature by adjusting the heating or cooling system based on the temperature sensor reading.
- Maintain a temperature setpoint of 33.5Â°C with a tolerance of Â±0.5Â°C.

###### Safety and Alarm Logic
- If temperature exceeds 35Â°C or drops below 32Â°C, trigger an alarm and pause fermentation until the issue is resolved.
