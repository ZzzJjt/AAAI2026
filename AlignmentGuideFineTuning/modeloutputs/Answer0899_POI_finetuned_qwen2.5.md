### Intent:
The task is to develop an IEC 61131-3 Structured Text program that controls a traffic light system with pedestrian requests and emergency vehicle handling while ensuring safe state transitions and real-time operation.

### Prompt:
**Pneumatic System Control Using 61131-3 Structured Text:**

Write a self-contained 61131-3 structured text program (not a function block) to control a pneumatic system with a control loop frequency of 100 ms. The system should regulate the flow of air to actuators based on input signals, maintaining a flow rate of 50 standard liters per minute. The system must also ensure that the pressure remains within the specified range of 5.5 to 6 bar. Implement safety checks to handle any deviations in flow or pressure and ensure efficient and reliable operation under varying load conditions.

**T-A-G:**

ðŸŸ¥ T (Task) â€“ What You Need to Do

Develop a self-contained IEC 61131-3 Structured Text (ST) program to control a pneumatic system. The system must maintain a stable flow rate and safe pressure range while executing on a 100 ms control cycle. You must also implement safety checks for fault conditions.

ðŸŸ© A (Action) â€“ How to Do It
	1.	Flow Control Logic:
	â€¢	Use FlowInput (REAL) to monitor the current airflow rate.
	â€¢	Maintain a flow rate of 50 SLPM by controlling FlowValveOutput (BOOL).
	â€¢	Open the valve if FlowInput is below the setpoint; otherwise, hold or close.
	2.	Pressure Monitoring and Protection:
	â€¢	Use PressureInput (REAL) to ensure the pressure stays between 5.5 and 6.0 bar.
	â€¢	If pressure is out of bounds, activate PressureReliefValve (BOOL) and raise a PressureError flag.
	3.	Deviation & Fault Detection:
	â€¢	If the absolute difference between FlowInput and FlowSetpoint is greater than 5.0, set FlowError := TRUE.
	4.	Timing Requirement:
	â€¢	Ensure the logic runs every 100 ms, complying with the systemâ€™s real-time requirements.

ðŸŸ¦ G (Goal) â€“ What You Want to Achieve

Your program should:
	â€¢	Maintain airflow stability at 50 SLPM
	â€¢	Keep system pressure safely between 5.5 and 6.0 bar
	â€¢	Detect and report anomalies in flow or pressure
	â€¢	Run reliably in a real-time industrial control loop, ready for integration with alarms, HMI displays, or safety logic

    PressureInput : REAL;
    FlowSetpoint : REAL := 50.0;
    MinPressure : REAL := 5.5;
    MaxPressure : REAL := 6.0;

    FlowValveOutput : BOOL := FALSE;
    PressureReliefValve : BOOL := FALSE;
    FlowError : BOOL := FALSE;
    PressureError : BOOL := FALSE;
END_VAR

// Flow control logic
IF FlowInput < FlowSetpoint THEN
    FlowValveOutput := TRUE;
ELSE
    FlowValveOutput := FALSE;
END_IF

// Pressure check logic
IF PressureInput < MinPressure OR PressureInput > MaxPressure THEN
    PressureError := TRUE;
    PressureReliefValve := TRUE;
ELSE
    PressureError := FALSE;
    PressureReliefValve := FALSE;
END_IF

// Flow deviation check
IF ABS(FlowInput - FlowSetpoint) > 5.0 THEN
    FlowError := TRUE;

    FlowError := FALSE;

**T (Task) â€“ What You Need to Do:**

Develop a self-contained IEC 61131-3 Structured Text (ST) program to control a traffic light system with pedestrian requests and emergency vehicle handling. The system must ensure safe state transitions, prioritize emergency vehicles, and respond to pedestrian requests while maintaining smooth traffic flow.

â¸»

**A (Action) â€“ How to Do It:**

	1.	Define the systemâ€™s states (Green, Yellow, Red) and transitions (e.g., from Green to Yellow, from Yellow to Red, etc.).
	2.	Implement logic to handle pedestrian requests, giving priority to crossing requests over normal traffic light cycles.
	3.	Integrate emergency vehicle detection, ensuring that emergency vehicles are given priority by overriding normal light sequencing.
	4.	Manage timing and sequencing to ensure smooth traffic flow while responding to pedestrian and emergency vehicle requests.
	5.	Implement safety checks to ensure that the system defaults to a safe state (e.g., Red) if any input is lost or invalid.

	6.	Ensure that the program is structured in a way that is easy to understand and maintain, with clear comments explaining the logic behind each part of the system.

	7.	Perform thorough testing to ensure that the system operates reliably under all conditions, including normal traffic flow, pedestrian requests, and emergency vehicle priority.

	8.	Optimize the program for real-time execution, ensuring that all transitions occur within the specified timing constraints.

	9.	Include detailed comments explaining the logic of the program, including the handling of pedestrian requests, emergency vehicle detection, and state transitions.

	10.	Provide a clear explanation of the systemâ€™s operation, including how it prioritizes different types of requests and manages traffic flow.

**G (Goal) â€“ What You Want to Achieve:**

	â€¢	Create a self-contained IEC 61131-3 Structured Text program that controls a traffic light system with pedestrian requests and emergency vehicle handling.
	â€¢	Ensure that the system operates reliably and efficiently, with safe state transitions and real-time responsiveness.
	â€¢	Implement logic that prioritizes emergency vehicles while still allowing for pedestrian requests and normal traffic flow.
	â€¢	Provide a clear and maintainable code structure with detailed comments explaining the systemâ€™s operation and logic.

	â€¢	Develop a system that is both functional and safe, with the ability to respond quickly to changing traffic
