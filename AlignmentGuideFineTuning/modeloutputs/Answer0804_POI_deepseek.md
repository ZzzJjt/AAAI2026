**MATLAB Code Explanation:**

The code above defines a model predictive control (MPC) problem for an aircraft. The state vector `x` contains the aircraft's position, velocity, and control inputs. The control vector `u` contains the aircraft's pitch, roll, and yaw angles.

The state transition model `A` and input matrix `B` describe the dynamics of the aircraft. The cost function
