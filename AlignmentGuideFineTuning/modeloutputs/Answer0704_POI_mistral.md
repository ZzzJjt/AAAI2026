	â€¢	Output as numerical values or logs (optional: comments explaining each section)

**Notes:**

1.	Use a standard aircraft model (e.g., 6-DOF model) for the dynamic simulation.
2.	Consider the following constraints:
	â€¢	Maximum thrust and drag
	â€¢	Maximum angle of attack and sideslip angle
	â€¢	Minimum and maximum speed
	â€¢	Minimum and maximum altitude
3.	Optimize the fuel efficiency by minimizing the fuel consumption rate.
4.	Include a wind disturbance model in the simulation.
5.	Ensure the MPC controller can handle real-time implementation.
6.	Consider using MATLAB's built-in optimization functions (e.g., `fmincon`) for the MPC optimization problem.
7.	Document the code with comments to explain each section and its purpose.

**Examples:**

1.	Implement a MATLAB script for a 6-DOF aircraft model with MPC control, considering dynamic constraints, fuel efficiency, and wind disturbances.
2.	Develop a MATLAB script to simulate the MPC-controlled aircraft trajectory under various wind conditions and compare the fuel efficiency performance.
3.	Modify the MATLAB script to include safety constraints, such as minimum distance from other aircraft or obstacles.
4.	Optimize the MPC controller parameters to improve the robustness and performance of the aircraft trajectory control system.
