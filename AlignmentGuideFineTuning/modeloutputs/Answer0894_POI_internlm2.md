### Intent:
**Intent Summary:**  
Create an IEC 61131-3 Structured Text program to control a 5-floor elevator system, managing floor detection, door timing (7s default + 10s extension if no requests), directional movement prioritization, and safety interlocks (e.g., no motion while doors are open).

### Prompt:
**Elevator Control System Using 61131-3 Structured Text:**

Write a self-contained 61131-3 structured text program to control an elevator in a 5-floor building. Each floor has top and bottom limit switches to detect the elevatorâ€™s position. The elevator door should remain open for 7 seconds after reaching a floor. If no buttons inside the elevator cabin are pressed during this time, the door should reopen for an additional 10 seconds before closing. The elevatorâ€™s movement is governed by its current direction and the direction imposed by the up and down call buttons on each

**T-A-G:**

ðŸŸ¥ T (Task) â€“ What You Need to Do

Write a self-contained IEC 61131-3 Structured Text program to control an elevator system in a 5-floor building. The program must manage floor detection, door operation, movement direction, and button requests, all while ensuring safety and timing precision.

ðŸŸ© A (Action) â€“ How to Do It
	1.	Define Inputs:
	â€¢	AtFloor[1..5] â€“ detects the elevatorâ€™s current position
	â€¢	CabinRequest[1..5] â€“ buttons pressed inside the elevator
	â€¢	UpCall[1..4], DownCall[2..5] â€“ floor call buttons for up/down requests
	â€¢	TopLimit / BottomLimit â€“ physical limit switches (optional for validation)
	2.	Implement Door Logic:
	â€¢	When the elevator arrives at a floor (AtFloor[CurrentFloor] = TRUE):
	â€¢	Open the door and run a 7-second timer
	â€¢	If no cabin request is received during this time, extend door opening by 10 more seconds using a second timer
	â€¢	After timeout, close the door automatically
	3.	Direction and Movement Logic:
	â€¢	Maintain a GoingUp or GoingDown flag
	â€¢	While moving, prioritize handling requests in the current direction
	â€¢	If no requests remain in the current direction, reverse direction
	â€¢	Elevator must not move if the door is open
	4.	Sample Logic Snippet:

 IF AtFloor[CurrentFloor] THEN
    DoorOpen := TRUE;
    Timer7s(IN := TRUE, PT := T#7s);

    IF Timer7s.Q THEN
        IF NOT AnyCabinRequest THEN
            Timer10s(IN := TRUE, PT := T#10s);
            IF Timer10s.Q THEN
                DoorOpen := FALSE;
            END_IF;
        ELSE
            DoorOpen := FALSE;
        END_IF;
    END_IF;
END_IF;

IF NOT DoorOpen THEN
    IF GoingUp THEN
        // Handle UpCall and CabinRequest above
    ELSIF GoingDown THEN
        // Handle DownCall and CabinRequest below
    END_IF;
END_IF;
ðŸŸ¦ G (Goal) â€“ What You Want to Achieve

Deliver a fully functional elevator control program that:
	â€¢	Accurately opens and closes the door with conditional delay logic
	â€¢	Responds dynamically to floor and cabin button inputs
	â€¢	Honors the current direction of movement and reverses only when needed
	â€¢	Prevents motion when the door is open, ensuring passenger safety
	â€¢	Is clean, modular, and adaptable to additional features such as emergency stop, overload protection, or voice annunciators

ðŸ”µ R (Reasoning) â€“ Why It Matters

The elevator control system is a critical component of any multi-floor building, ensuring the safe and efficient movement of passengers and cargo. By implementing a well-designed, modular, and adaptable program, you can create a reliable and maintainable system that meets the needs of your building and its occupants.

ðŸ”´ W (Warning) â€“ What to Watch Out For

When designing and implementing the elevator control system, be mindful of the following:
	â€¢	Safety interlocks: Ensure that the elevator cannot move while the door is open, and that it stops immediately if an emergency stop is activated.
	â€¢	Load capacity: Consider the maximum weight the elevator can carry and implement appropriate safety measures to prevent overloading.
	â€¢	Reliability: Use robust and reliable hardware components, and implement redundancy where necessary to ensure continuous operation.
	â€¢	Scalability: Design the program with future expansion in mind, allowing for easy integration of additional features or floors.
	â€¢	Testing and validation: Thoroughly test the system in various scenarios, including normal operation, emergency situations, and edge cases, to ensure its reliability and safety.

ðŸ”µ T (Tips) â€“ How to Do It Even Better

To further enhance the elevator control system, consider the following tips:
	â€¢	Implement a voice announcement system to inform passengers of the elevator's current status and estimated arrival time.
	â€¢	Include an emergency stop button on each floor, allowing passengers to halt the elevator in case of an emergency.
	â€¢	Implement a weight sensor to monitor the elevator's load and prevent overloading.
	â€¢	Consider adding a priority system for VIPs or disabled passengers, allowing them to bypass the queue and access the elevator more quickly.
	â€¢	Use a graphical user interface (GUI) to monitor and control the elevator system, providing an intuitive and user-friendly interface for maintenance and troubleshooting.

ðŸ”µ E (Example) â€“ How It Could Look

Here's a simplified example of how the elevator control program might look in IEC 61131-3 Structured Text:

```scss
IF AtFloor[CurrentFloor] THEN
    DoorOpen := TRUE;
    Timer7s(IN := TRUE, PT := T#7s);

    IF Timer7s.Q THEN
        IF NOT AnyCabinRequest THEN
            Timer10s(IN := TRUE, PT := T#10s
