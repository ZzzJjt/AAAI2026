Provide a clear and concise report of your findings and recommendations for the implementation of the fuzzy logic controller in a real-world chemical reactor system.

**Note:** This task is designed to test your understanding of intelligent control systems, particularly fuzzy logic control, and your ability to apply this knowledge to a practical chemical process control problem. You are expected to demonstrate a good understanding of the principles of fuzzy logic, the design of fuzzy rules, and the implementation of fuzzy inference systems in Python.

**Task 1: Design Fuzzy Logic Rules and Membership Functions**

1.1. Define the input and output variables for the fuzzy logic controller.

Input variables: Temperature (T), Pressure (P), and Reaction Rate (R)

Output variables: Control Actions (CA)

1.2. Determine the membership functions for each input variable.

For example, you can use triangular or trapezoidal membership functions for each variable. The number of membership functions can be determined based on the complexity of the process and the desired level of control.
