### Intent:
**Intent Summary:**  
Develop a fuzzy logic controller in Python to optimize turbine operation in a thermal power plant by dynamically adjusting temperature and pressure based on real-time conditions, ensuring efficient and stable performance under varying loads.

### Prompt:
**Model Predictive Control for Turbine Optimization in a Thermal Power Plant Using Python:**

Develop Python code to implement a model predictive control (MPC) algorithm for optimizing the operation of a turbine in a thermal power plant. The MPC should account for operational constraints, energy efficiency, and thermal dynamics, while ensuring robust performance under varying load conditions and external disturbances.

**R-I-S-E:**

🟥 R（Role）

Act as a control systems engineer developing Python-based model predictive control (MPC) solutions for energy systems in thermal power plants.

🟩 I（Input）

You are tasked with optimizing the operation of a turbine in a thermal power plant. The system must handle complex thermal dynamics, respond to varying electrical load demands, and operate within strict physical and efficiency constraints, all while being robust to external disturbances.

🟧 S（Steps）
	1.	Model the turbine’s thermal and dynamic behavior in Python, including relevant constraints such as maximum pressure, temperature, and ramp rates.
	2.	Design and implement a model predictive control (MPC) algorithm that forecasts system behavior and adjusts control inputs to meet future targets.
	3.	Integrate considerations for energy efficiency, load tracking, and operational safety.
	4.	Simulate the turbine’s performance under various load scenarios and disturbances to validate the effectiveness of the MPC strategy.

🟦 E（Expectation）

The resulting MPC system should demonstrate improved control performance, with higher energy efficiency, better load-following capability, and enhanced robustness compared to traditional control approaches—ensuring optimal turbine operation even under fluctuating conditions.
