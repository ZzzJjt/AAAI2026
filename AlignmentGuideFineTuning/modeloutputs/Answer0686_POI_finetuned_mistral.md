### Intent:
The task involves creating a structured I/O list for feedwater control in a power plant's steam-water cycle, documenting instrumentation signals (analog/digital), ranges, setpoints, and P&ID references to support PLC/HMI integration and commissioning.  

**Intent Summary:**  
*"Generate a standardized I/O list table for feedwater control signals (flow, level, valves, pumps) with tagnames, engineering units, ranges, and P&ID links to enable control system implementation."*

### Prompt:
**IO List Steam Water Cycle:**

Create an I/O list as a table for feedwater control in a steam-water cycle in a power plant. Have as columns names, signal tagnumber, analog/digital, engineering unit, ranges, setpoint, and P&ID reference.

**R-I-S-E:**

ðŸŸ¥ R (Role) â€“ Define Your Role

Act as a control systems engineer responsible for defining instrumentation and signal documentation for the feedwater control system in a steam-water cycle of a power plant.

â¸»

ðŸŸ© I (Input) â€“ Information Provided

You are to create an I/O list in table format that includes the following columns for each signal:
	â€¢	Signal Name
	â€¢	Signal Tag Number
	â€¢	Analog/Digital
	â€¢	Engineering Unit
	â€¢	Range
	â€¢	Setpoint
	â€¢	P&ID Reference

This list will cover essential elements of the feedwater control loop, such as flow transmitters, drum level indicators, control valves, and pump statuses.

ðŸŸ§ S (Steps) â€“ Steps to Perform
	1.	Identify common I/O signals associated with feedwater control, including:
	â€¢	Drum Level Transmitters
	â€¢	Feedwater Flow Transmitters
	â€¢	Control Valve Positions
	â€¢	Pump Start/Stop Signals
	2.	Assign each signal a unique tagnumber and specify whether it is analog or digital.
	3.	Add appropriate engineering units (e.g., %, t/h, bar), define realistic ranges (e.g., 0â€“100%), and enter typical setpoints.
	4.	Ensure each entry is linked to a P&ID reference for traceability and cross-discipline alignment.
	5.	Format the data into a clean, consistent table that can be imported into design tools, PLC/HMI projects, or engineering reports.

â¸»

ðŸŸ¦ E (Expectation) â€“ Expected Outcome

Deliver a complete and professionally structured I/O list for the feedwater control section of the steam-water cycle. This list will support:
	â€¢	PLC configuration
	â€¢	Instrumentation specification
	â€¢	HMI integration
	â€¢	Commissioning and validation aligned with P&ID documentation
