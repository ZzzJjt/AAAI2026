### Intent:
**Intent Summary:**  
Develop a structured text program to control a coffee machine's automated process, managing valves and mixer operations through state transitions while ensuring emergency stop functionality and proper ingredient dispensing.

### Prompt:
**Pneumatic System Control Using 61131-3 Structured Text:**

Write a self-contained 61131-3 structured text program (not a function block) to control a pneumatic system with a control loop frequency of 100 ms. The system should regulate the flow of air to actuators based on input signals, maintaining a flow rate of 50 standard liters per minute. The system must also ensure that the pressure remains within the specified range of 5.5 to 6 bar. Implement safety checks to handle any deviations in flow or pressure and ensure efficient and reliable operation under varying load conditions.

**C-A-R-E:**

ðŸŸ¥ C (Context) â€“ The Background

In pneumatic automation systems, precise flow and pressure control is essential to ensure reliable actuator performance and energy efficiency. Industrial applications often require real-time responsiveness, flow rate stability, and safety enforcement. Implementing this in a PLC with IEC 61131-3 Structured Text allows for scalable, deterministic control across varying load conditions.

ðŸŸ© A (Action) â€“ The Implementation Task

Develop a self-contained Structured Text (ST) program that:
	â€¢	Executes every 100 milliseconds (100 ms loop frequency)
	â€¢	Regulates airflow to a setpoint of 50 standard liters per minute (SLPM)
	â€¢	Monitors pressure to ensure it stays between 5.5 and 6.0 bar
	â€¢	Includes safety mechanisms that:
	â€¢	Detect and respond to over/under pressure
	â€¢	Handle abnormal flow deviations
	â€¢	Activates relevant outputs such as:
	â€¢	A flow valve actuator
	â€¢	A pressure relief valve
	â€¢	Error flags for fault diagnostics

â¸»

ðŸŸ¨ R (Result) â€“ The Expected Outcome

The resulting program will:
	â€¢	Maintain stable flow to meet actuator requirements
	â€¢	Ensure operational safety by preventing pressure-related faults
	â€¢	Trigger alerts or shutoffs when unsafe conditions are detected
	â€¢	Operate reliably across varying loads and environmental conditions
	â€¢	Be suitable for integration into larger industrial automation systems

    PressureError := TRUE;
    PressureReliefValve := TRUE;  // Activate safety
ELSE
    PressureError := FALSE;
    PressureReliefValve := FALSE;
END_IF

// Flow Deviation Check
IF ABS(FlowInput - FlowSetpoint) > 5.0 THEN
    FlowError := TRUE;
ELSE
    FlowError := FALSE;
