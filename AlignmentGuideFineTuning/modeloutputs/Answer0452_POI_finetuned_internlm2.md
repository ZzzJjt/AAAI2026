### Intent:
**Intent Summary:**  
Develop an IEC 61131-3 Structured Text function block to monitor OPC UA, Modbus, and Profinet connections, trigger alarms on failures, and log detailed audit trail entries with error codes and timestamps for real-time diagnostics.

### Prompt:
**Communication Monitoring for OPC UA, Modbus, and Profinet Using IEC 61131-3 Structured Text:**

Develop a function block in structured text (ST) as per IEC 61131-3 standards to monitor communication connections to an OPC UA server, Modbus server, and Profinet in a machine system. The function block should continuously check the connection status of each protocol, and if any connection fails, an alarm should be triggered. Additionally, when a connection is lost, an entry must be created in the audit trail, detailing the reason for the server being down along with the corresponding error code. Discuss the implementation logic for monitoring multiple protocols, error detection, and how to effectively manage and log communication failures for real-time monitoring and troubleshooting.

**R-I-S-E:**

🟥 R (Role) – Your Role

Act as a control systems engineer developing IEC 61131-3 Structured Text (ST) function blocks for real-time communication monitoring in industrial automation systems.

🟩 I (Input) – What You’re Given

You need to create a function block that monitors communication links to an OPC UA server, a Modbus server, and a Profinet device. The function block must detect connection failures, trigger alarms for each protocol independently, and generate audit trail entries that include error codes and reasons for the failure. It should operate cyclically and be capable of managing multiple protocol states simultaneously.

🟧 S (Steps) – What You Need to Do
	1.	Design a function block in Structured Text (ST) with input parameters for each protocol’s connection state and error details.
	2.	Implement logic to detect status changes, timeouts, or communication faults.
	3.	When a failure is detected, raise an alarm (e.g., set a BOOL flag or output an error code) and log a detailed audit entry including timestamp, protocol type, error reason, and code.
	4.	Ensure that the function block handles each protocol independently and resets alarms or logs recovery if communication is restored.

🟦 E (Expectation) – What Success Looks Like

The result should be a robust, reusable ST function block capable of continuously monitoring OPC UA, Modbus, and Profinet connections. It should trigger real-time alarms for any failures and provide accurate, timestamped audit trail entries to support fast diagnostics, improved uptime, and system-wide communication transparency.

**C-Y-A:**

🟠 C (Context) – The Situation

In industrial automation systems, communication between devices and servers is critical for real-time control and data exchange. Monitoring the health of these connections is essential for maintaining system stability and ensuring timely intervention in case of failures. However, managing multiple protocols (e.g., OPC UA, Modbus, and Profinet) can be complex, requiring a robust and self-contained solution to handle each protocol independently and provide real-time diagnostics.

🟢 Y (Your Answer) – The “So What?”

Develop a function block in IEC 61131-3 Structured Text (ST) to monitor communication links to an OPC UA server, a Modbus server, and a Profinet device. The function block should detect connection failures, trigger alarms for each protocol independently, and generate audit trail entries that include error codes and reasons for the failure. The function block should operate cyclically and be capable of managing multiple protocol states simultaneously.

🟠 A (Action) – What You Should Do Next

Implement the function block in Structured Text, ensuring that it handles each protocol independently and provides real-time diagnostics through alarms and audit trail entries. Test the function block with various connection scenarios, including successful and failed connections, to verify its robustness and accuracy.
