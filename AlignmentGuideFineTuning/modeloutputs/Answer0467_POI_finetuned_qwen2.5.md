### Intent:
**Intent Summary:**  
Develop an IEC 61131-3 Structured Text safety interlock program to monitor reactor conditions (pressure, temperature, level, etc.), trigger protective actions (valve control, alarms, shutdowns) upon faults, and ensure fail-safe operation during emergencies or sensor failures.  

*(Focus: Automated safety logic for reactor protection with fault tolerance and predefined responses to critical events.)*

### Prompt:
**Interlock Pressure Relief:**

Develop a self-contained IEC 61131-3 Structured Text program to implement an interlock system for opening a pressure relief valve in a vessel upon detecting overpressure. The program should monitor the vessel pressure using a pressure sensor and trigger the opening of the relief valve when the pressure exceeds a predefined safe limit.

The logic should ensure that the pressure relief valve remains open until the vessel pressure drops below a safe threshold. Additionally, incorporate safety checks to account for sensor failures or valve malfunctions, ensuring that the system defaults to a safe state in the event of a fault. Discuss the significance of pressure relief systems in protecting industrial processes from overpressure hazards and ensuring operational safety.

ðŸŸ¥ R (Role) â€“ Your Role

Act as an industrial automation engineer responsible for implementing automated pressure relief interlock logic using IEC 61131-3 Structured Text to ensure safe operation of a pressurized vessel.

ðŸŸ© I (Input) â€“ What Youâ€™re Given

You are tasked with developing a self-contained Structured Text program to protect a vessel from overpressure. The system must:
	â€¢	Monitor pressure using a pressure transmitter (PT)
	â€¢	Open a pressure relief valve when the pressure exceeds a defined high limit (e.g., 15 bar)
	â€¢	Keep the valve open until the pressure drops below a reset threshold (e.g., 12 bar)
	â€¢	Include fail-safe logic that activates the relief valve in case of:
	â€¢	Sensor failure (e.g., invalid or stuck reading)
	â€¢	Valve malfunction
	â€¢	Ensure the system defaults to a safe state (valve open) when faults are detected

â¸»

ðŸŸ§ S (Steps) â€“ What You Need to Do
	1.	Declare variables for the pressure sensor (PT_101), relief valve (RELIEF_VALVE), fault inputs (SensorFault, ValveFault), and latching logic (SHUTDOWN_LATCH).
	2.	Implement interlock logic that:
	â€¢	Opens the relief valve when PT_101 > HIGH_LIMIT
	â€¢	Maintains the open state until PT_101 < RESET_LIMIT
	â€¢	Sets RELIEF_VALVE := TRUE if any fault condition is detected
	3.	Add latching and reset functionality to avoid premature valve closure.
	4.	Include comments and structure for readability, testing, and operational traceability.

ðŸŸ¦ E (Expectation) â€“ What Success Looks Like

You produce a reliable, self-contained safety interlock that protects the vessel from overpressure. It reacts instantly to unsafe conditions, remains in a protective state until conditions stabilize, and automatically fails to a safe state during component faults. The interlock improves system safety, prevents equipment damage, and ensures compliance with industrial safety standards.

**A (Action) â€“ How to Do It:**

	1.	Define the required variables:
	â€¢	PT: Pressure sensor input
	â€¢	Valve: Pressure relief valve output
	â€¢	Overpressure: Boolean flag for overpressure detection
	â€¢	Reset: Boolean flag for pressure reset
	â€¢	Interlock: Boolean flag for interlock status
	â€¢	Shutdown: Boolean flag for shutdown logic
	2.	Implement the logic to monitor the pressure and trigger the interlock:
	â€¢	When PT > Overpressure limit, set Overpressure to TRUE and Valve to TRUE.
	â€¢	When PT < Reset limit, set Overpressure to FALSE and Valve to FALSE.
	â€¢	Use a timer or latching mechanism to ensure the valve remains open until the pressure resets.
	3.	Add safety checks for sensor and valve faults:
	â€¢	When Overpressure is TRUE and Valve is FALSE, set Shutdown to TRUE.
	â€¢	When Shutdown is TRUE, ensure the system defaults to a safe state (e.g., valve open).
	4.	Implement fault handling and latching logic to ensure the system remains in a safe state during sensor or valve failures.
