### Intent:
**Intent Summary:**  
Generate an IEC 61131-3 Structured Text PLC program to automate a two-step urea synthesis process, controlling material injection (ammonia/COâ‚‚), monitoring reactor pressure/temperature, enforcing timed reactions, and ensuring safety limits, with fault handling and state-based logic.  

*(Focus: Distributed control systems, event-driven execution, and scalability for Industry 4.0 applications.)*

### Prompt:
**Learning IEC 61499:**
Provide a concise introduction to the IEC 61499 programming language, emphasizing key concepts for someone already familiar with IEC 61131-3. Include a comparison of their fundamental differences in terms of architecture, execution models, and flexibility for distributed control systems. Additionally, compile a list of five key references for further reading on IEC 61499, highlighting its relevance in modern industrial applications.


**B-A-B:**

ðŸŸ¥ Before â€“ The Starting Point

Youâ€™re already familiar with IEC 61131-3, the traditional standard for PLC programming used in industrial automation. While IEC 61131-3 is effective for centralized control, it can be limiting when building distributed, event-driven, and component-based control systemsâ€”increasingly common in Industry 4.0 environments.

ðŸŸ© After â€“ The Desired Outcome

Get a concise introduction to IEC 61499, focusing on:
	â€¢	Its core concepts (function blocks, event/data separation, distribution)
	â€¢	A clear comparison with IEC 61131-3 regarding:
	â€¢	Architectural philosophy
	â€¢	Execution models (scan-based vs. event-driven)
	â€¢	Scalability and flexibility for distributed systems
	â€¢	A curated list of five key references to dive deeper into IEC 61499, including books, academic papers, and official documentation relevant to modern industrial applications.

â¸»

ðŸŸ¦ Bridge â€“ How to Get There

To help users transition from IEC 61131-3 to IEC 61499:
	â€¢	Present parallel concepts (e.g., FBs in both standards) and explain how IEC 61499 extends or redefines them
	â€¢	Highlight decentralized control logic, portability, and event-driven execution as key strengths of IEC 61499
	â€¢	Recommend authoritative resources such as the IEC standard itself, literature by industrial automation experts, and academic tutorials focused on real-world deployment in smart factories
