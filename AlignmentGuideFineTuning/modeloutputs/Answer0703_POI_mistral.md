### Intent:
Develop a MATLAB script to model a distillation column's dynamics (focusing on feed rate-temperature relationships) and implement model predictive control (MPC) for process optimization under constraints, without graphical outputs.

### Prompt:
**MATLAB Distillation Column Modeling and Control:**

Develop MATLAB code for a mathematical model of a distillation column, capturing its dynamic relationships between feed rates and temperature. Avoid plotting results.
Implement a model predictive control (MPC) scheme using the developed model to optimize the distillation process while considering operational constraints.

**R-T-F:**

ðŸŸ¥ Rï¼ˆRoleï¼‰

Act as a MATLAB engineer specializing in process modeling and predictive control.

ðŸŸ© Tï¼ˆTaskï¼‰

Develop MATLAB code to model the dynamic behavior of a distillation column, focusing on the relationship between feed rates and temperature. Then, implement a model predictive control (MPC) strategy using the developed model to optimize column operation under defined constraints. Do not include any plots or graphical outputs.
