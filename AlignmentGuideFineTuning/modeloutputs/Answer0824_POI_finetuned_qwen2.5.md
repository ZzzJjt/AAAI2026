### Intent:
**Intent Summary:**  
Develop an OPC UA subscription function block in IEC 61131-3 Structured Text to create, manage, and monitor real-time data subscriptions with configurable priority and interval, while handling errors and connection states.  

*(Focus: OPC UA subscription lifecycle, error handling, and real-time monitoring for industrial control systems.)*

### Prompt:
**Ethernet PowerLink Diagnostics Using IEC 61131-3 Structured Text:**

Develop a function block in structured text (ST) based on IEC 61131 standards to retrieve Ethernet PowerLink diagnostic information from a control node device via a PowerLink managing node (MN). The function block should collect and display key diagnostic data such as communication status, error codes, and node health. The program must ensure that the diagnostic information is accurately processed and relayed to the controller for further analysis. Discuss how the function block interacts with the PowerLink network, handles error detection, and provides real-time diagnostics for maintaining network integrity.

**T-A-G:**

ðŸŸ¥ T (Task) â€“ What You Need to Do

Develop an IEC 61131-3 Structured Text (ST) function block to retrieve and process diagnostic information from Ethernet PowerLink control nodes via a Managing Node (MN).

ðŸŸ© A (Action) â€“ How to Do It

Implement logic to cyclically collect key diagnostic data such as communication status, error codes, and node health. The function block should interact with the MN to access diagnostic registers, process and validate the received data, detect errors, and forward structured output to the controller. Include logic for fault handling and ensure that the data is refreshed in real time for monitoring and logging purposes.

ðŸŸ¦ G (Goal) â€“ What You Want to Achieve

Provide a reliable and reusable diagnostic tool that enables real-time visibility into the condition of PowerLink nodes, improves troubleshooting efficiency, and supports the long-term stability and maintainability of the communication network.

**R-I-S-E:**

ðŸŸ¥ R (Role) â€“ Your Role

You are a PLC programmer or control systems engineer responsible for developing diagnostic tools for Ethernet PowerLink networks using IEC 61131 standards.

ðŸŸ© I (Input) â€“ What Youâ€™re Given

You are working with an Ethernet PowerLink network where diagnostic information is stored in the control nodes and can be read via a Managing Node (MN). Your task is to create a function block that will retrieve and display key diagnostic data such as communication status, error codes, and node health.

ðŸŸ¦ S (Steps) â€“ How to Do It

	1.	Define the function block inputs and outputs:
	â€¢	Inputs:
	â€¢	Control node identifier
	â€¢	MN connection parameters
	â€¢	Optional: error handling flags
	â€¢	Outputs:
	â€¢	Communication status (e.g., up/down)
	â€¢	Error codes (e.g., communication errors, protocol errors)
	â€¢	Control node health (e.g., operational, maintenance required)
	2.	Implement logic to establish a connection to the Managing Node (MN) using PowerLink communication protocols.
	3.	Develop a method to read diagnostic data from the control node via the MN, including key information such as communication status, error codes, and node health.
	4.	Process the diagnostic data, ensuring proper error handling and status reporting.
	5.	Implement cyclic execution to continuously monitor and update the diagnostic information.
	6.	Provide an output format that is easy to read and interpret for real-time monitoring and troubleshooting.

ðŸŸ© E (Example) â€“ What It Should Look Like

	â€¢	Inputs:
	â€¢	Control node identifier: 10
	â€¢	MN connection parameters: (IP address, port number)
	â€¢	Outputs:
	â€¢	Communication status: up
	â€¢	Error codes: 0 (no errors)
	â€¢	Control node health: operational
	â€¢	(Optional) Error handling flags: no errors
	â€¢	Real-time monitoring: continuously updated diagnostic information

	â€¢	Programming example (Pseudocode):
		FUNCTION_BLOCK DiagnosticsControlNode
		 VAR
		ControlNodeId : INT := 10;
		MNAddress : STRING := "192.168.1.100:10011";
		CommunicationStatus : BOOL := FALSE;
		ErrorCodes : ARRAY[1..10] OF INT := [
