### Intent:
**Intent Summary:**  
Create a detailed control narrative for an ammonium nitrate reactor, specifying setpoints, instrumentation, operational sequences, and interlock logic to ensure safe, automated, and consistent reactor operation.  

*(For code generation: Focus on translating setpoints, PID control loops, equipment actions, and safety interlocks into programmable logic.)*

### Prompt:
**Control Narrative Beer Brewing:**

Create a control narrative for beer brewing including concrete setpoints and ranges.

Create a detailed explanation of the Lautering process (Section 4). Include the equipment and instrumentation needed. Provide a list of the steps to execute.

**C-A-R-E:**

🟥 C (Context) – Background Situation

In beer brewing automation, a well-defined control narrative is essential for ensuring that brewing stages are executed with precision and consistency. One of the most critical stages is lautering, where wort is separated from the grain. Without a clear explanation of setpoints, instrumentation, and steps, engineers and operators may face inefficiencies, delays, or poor-quality output.

⸻

🟩 A (Action) – Task to Perform

Develop a structured control narrative for the entire beer brewing process, and provide a detailed Section 4 focused on the lautering phase, including:
	•	Concrete setpoints and ranges (e.g., temperature, flow, turbidity)
	•	The equipment and instrumentation used during lautering
	•	A step-by-step description of the lautering process logic
	•	Automated control actions triggered by sensor feedback and operator input

⸻

🟨 R (Result) – Expected Outcome

The result should be a practical, actionable control narrative that:
	•	Standardizes brewing operations for consistent beer quality
	•	Provides engineering and operations teams with a shared reference
	•	Includes key automation logic and instrumentation details
	•	Helps integrate control systems with process equipment

Section 4: Lautering Process

Setpoints:
	•	Mash rest temperature: 67 °C
	•	Lautering flow rate: 1.8 L/min
	•	Turbidity cut-off: < 200 NTU
	•	Sparge water temperature: 76 °C

Equipment & Instrumentation:
	•	Lauter tun with rake arms and false bottom
	•	Turbidity sensor at wort outlet
	•	Flow transmitter on wort and sparge lines
	•	Level transmitter in lauter tun
	•	Motorized valve to divert cloudy wort to waste

Steps:
	1.	Begin recirculation until turbidity < 200 NTU
	2.	Start wort transfer to kettle
	3.	Begin sparging at 76 °C while maintaining lauter tun level
	4.	Adjust rake arm position based on wort flow resistance
	5.	Stop sparging when grain bed is dry and total volume reached

Certainly! Below is a detailed control narrative for an ammonium nitrate reactor, including setpoints, instrumentation, operational sequences, and interlocks. This narrative is designed to provide clear guidance for engineers, operators, and automation teams responsible for the safe and efficient operation of the reactor.

### Ammonium Nitrate Reactor Control Narrative

#### Overview
The ammonium nitrate reactor is a continuous-flow reactor that produces ammonium nitrate by reacting ammonia and nitric acid in a controlled environment. The reactor operates at a fixed temperature and pressure, with precise flow control of the reactants. The process is monitored using a suite of sensors and instrumentation, and is controlled using PID loops and interlocks to ensure safe and efficient operation.

#### Setpoints and Ranges

| Parameter       | Setpoint       | Range                 |
|-----------------|----------------|-----------------------|
| Temperature     | 175 °C         | 170 °C – 180 °C      |
| Pressure        | 10 bar         | 9.5 bar – 10.5 bar   |
| Ammonia Flow    | 1000 kg/h      | 950 kg/h – 1050 kg/h |
| Nitric Acid Flow| 1000 kg/h      | 950 kg/h – 1050 kg/h |

#### Instrumentation

| Sensor/Transmitter | Location       | Signal Type | Purpose
