// Secondary loop variables
PV2: REAL; // Process variable: flow rate
SP2: REAL; // Setpoint: target flow rate (OP1)
OP2: REAL; // Output: control valve position
Kp2: REAL := 2.0; // Proportional gain

e2, e2_prev, e2_sum, e2_diff: REAL;

dt: TIME := t#100ms; // Sample time
t_last: TIME;
END_VAR

METHOD RunCascadeControl // Read current pressure and flow rate values PV1 := ReadPressure(); PV2 := ReadFlowRate();
// Primary loop: pressure control
e1 := SP1 - PV1;
e1_sum := e1_sum + e1 * dt;
e1_diff := (e1 - e1_prev) / dt;
OP1 := Kp1 * e1 + Ki1 * e1_sum + Kd1 * e1_diff;
e1_prev := e1;

// Limit OP1 to a valid range
IF OP1 > 100.0 THEN
    OP1 := 100.0;
ELSIF OP1 < 0.0 THEN
    OP1 := 0.0;

// Limit OP2 to a valid range
IF OP2 > 100.0 THEN
    OP2 := 100.0;
ELSIF OP2 < 0.0 THEN
    OP2 := 0.0;

🟥 B (Before) – The Challenge

Controlling pressure in a complex industrial process like a vessel or reactor can be difficult when fast disturbances affect an intermediate variable—like flow rate—that also impacts the pressure. Traditional single-loop PID controllers may not respond quickly enough, especially when the dynamics of the inner and outer loops differ significantly. You need a more responsive and stable control strategy.

⸻

🟩 A (After) – The Ideal Outcome

The provided code implements a cascade control structure using IEC 61131-3 Structured Text. It achieves:
	•	Tight control of vessel pressure (primary variable)
	•	Fast response to disturbances in flow rate (secondary variable)
	•	A nested control architecture, where the output of the outer PID (pressure loop) becomes the setpoint for the inner PID (flow loop)
	•	Stable and efficient process control with real-time feedback and output clamping to protect actuator ranges

⸻

🟧 B (Bridge) – The Explanation of the Code

The program defines two PID control loops:

✅ Primary Loop: Pressure Control
	•	Inputs:
	•	PV1: actual vessel pressure (from ReadPressure())
	•	SP1: desired pressure setpoint
	•	Computation:
	•	Calculates error e1 := SP1 - PV1
	•	Performs PID logic using Kp1, Ki1, and Kd1
	•	The output OP1 becomes the setpoint for the secondary loop (flow rate)
	•	Clamping: Ensures OP1 stays within [0, 100]

✅ Secondary Loop: Flow Control
	•	Inputs:
	•	PV2: actual flow rate (from ReadFlowRate())
	•	SP2 := OP1: setpoint received from the primary loop
	•	Computation:
	•	Calculates flow error e2 := SP2 - PV2
	•	Executes PID control using Kp2, Ki2, and Kd2
	•	The output OP2 sets the valve position via SetValvePosition(OP2)
	•	Clamping: Ensures OP2 stays within [0, 100]

⏱ Sample Time
	•	dt := t#100ms is used in integration and derivative calculations (although note: in actual implementation dt needs to be converted to a numeric type like REAL for math operations).

⸻

This code represents a classic cascade control system, where:
	•	The outer loop (pressure) addresses the slow-changing primary variable
	•	The inner loop (flow) quickly corrects disturbances affecting the outer loop
	•	Both loops use PID logic with separate tuning parameters, ensuring optimal control at each level

**Safety Considerations:**

The code does not include safety features such as fail-safe modes, emergency shutdown, or overpressure protection. These are critical for industrial processes and should be implemented in a real-world application. Additionally, the code assumes that the ReadPressure() and ReadFlowRate() functions return valid values. In a real system, these functions would need to include error handling and fault detection to ensure reliable operation.

**Additional Notes:**

1. The code uses a fixed sample time of 100ms for simplicity. In a real-world application, the sample time should be chosen based on the process dynamics and control requirements.
2. The code uses a simple clamping mechanism to limit the output to the actuator range. In a real system, more sophisticated anti-windup techniques may be necessary to prevent instability and ensure accurate control.
3. The code does not include any diagnostics or logging. In a real-world application, it's important to monitor the control loops' performance and record events for troubleshooting and process optimization.
4. The code does not account for any time delays in the process or control system. In a real system, these delays should be considered and compensated for to improve control performance.
5. The code does not include any tuning or optimization of the PID gains. In a real-world application, these parameters should be carefully tuned based on the process dynamics and control requirements.
6. The code does not include any anti-aliasing or filtering techniques to remove noise or high-frequency components from the control signals. In a real system, these techniques may be necessary to improve control stability and reduce oscillations.
7. The code does not include any deadband or hysteresis in the control logic. In a real system, these features may be used to improve control robustness and prevent oscillations near setpoints.
8. The code does not include any deadtime compensation or reset windup techniques. In a real system, these techniques may be necessary to improve control performance and prevent instability.
9. The code does not include any model predictive control (MPC) or advanced control techniques. In a real system, these techniques may be used to improve control performance and handle more complex process dynamics.
10. The code does not include any human-machine interface (HMI) or operator interface for monitoring and controlling the process. In a real system, an HMI would be necessary to interact with the control system and monitor process variables.
