### Intent:
**Intent Summary:**  
Design a pressure relief interlock system that opens a relief valve and triggers a shutdown when pressure exceeds safe limits, sensor failure occurs, or valve malfunction is detected, while ensuring safe reset conditions and alarm signaling.

### Prompt:
**Motor Interlock Function Block Diagram:**

Design a motor interlock as a function block diagram that prevents the motor from starting while other associated equipment is still running. The interlock should monitor the operational status of surrounding equipment and block the motor start command if any equipment is still active. Include inputs from sensors or status indicators and outputs that control the motor start circuit.

Provide the implementation of the MotorInterlock function block in IEC 61131-3 Structured Text. This function block should check the statuses of relevant equipment (e.g., EquipmentRunning), and if all equipment is stopped, it should allow the motor to start by setting the output to TRUE. If any equipment is still running, the output should remain FALSE, preventing the motor from starting.

Discuss the role of motor interlocks in industrial safety and how this logic prevents premature or unsafe motor operation.

**C-A-R-E:**

ðŸŸ¥ C (Context) â€“ The Background

In many industrial systems, motors are interdependent with other equipment such as pumps, conveyors, or valves. Starting a motor while surrounding equipment is still running may cause mechanical damage, sequence errors, or unsafe operating conditions. To ensure safety and process integrity, motor start commands must be interlocked with the status of associated equipment.

ðŸŸ© A (Action) â€“ The Implementation Task

Design a Motor Interlock Function Block Diagram and implement it in IEC 61131-3 Structured Text. The logic must:
	â€¢	Monitor the status of surrounding equipment using digital inputs such as Equipment1Running, Equipment2Running, etc.
	â€¢	Block the motor start if any of these inputs are TRUE (i.e., other equipment is active)
	â€¢	Set the output AllowStart := TRUE only when all equipment is inactive
	â€¢	Provide a function block (MotorInterlock) that is modular and reusable

Implementation structure:

FUNCTION_BLOCK MotorInterlock
VAR_INPUT
    Equipment1Running : BOOL;
    Equipment2Running : BOOL;
    Equipment3Running : BOOL;
END_VAR
VAR_OUTPUT
    AllowStart : BOOL;
END_VAR

AllowStart := NOT Equipment1Running AND NOT Equipment2Running AND NOT Equipment3Running;

ðŸŸ¨ R (Result) â€“ The Expected Outcome

This function block ensures that the motor only starts under safe conditions, preventing unintended operation during active sequences. It enhances operational safety, supports equipment coordination, and reduces the risk of mechanical failure or downtime caused by improper sequencing.

â¸»

ðŸŸ¦ E (Example) â€“ A Practical Use Case

In a mixing system, if Equipment1Running indicates that the agitator is active and Equipment2Running signals the tank feed pump is still flushing, then AllowStart := FALSE, and the motor cannot be started. Once both units are confirmed stopped, the operator can issue a valid start command, and AllowStart := TRUE.

This logic is essential for ensuring safe startup conditions, interlock chaining, and compliance with industrial automation safety standards.

**C-A-R-E:**

ðŸŸ¥ C (Context) â€“ The Background

Motor interlocks are crucial components in industrial safety systems. They prevent the unintended operation of motors or other equipment that could lead to accidents, equipment damage, or process disturbances. By interlocking the start of a motor with the status of associated equipment, we can ensure that the motor only starts when it is safe to do so.

â¸»

ðŸŸ© A (Action) â€“ The Implementation Task

To design a motor interlock function block, we need to consider the following steps:

1. **Identify the associated equipment**: Determine which equipment must be monitored to ensure safe motor operation. This could include pumps, valves, or other machinery that must be stopped before the motor can start.

2. **Define the interlock logic**: Create a logic that checks the status of the associated equipment. If any equipment is still running, the motor should not start. If all equipment is stopped, the motor can start.

3. **Implement the logic in IEC 61131-3 Structured Text**: Write the logic in a function block that can be reused in different projects. The function block should have inputs for the status of the associated equipment and an output that indicates whether the motor can start.

4. **Test the function block**: Verify that the function block works as expected by simulating different scenarios and checking the output.

ðŸŸ¨ R (Result) â€“ The Expected Outcome

The motor interlock function block should prevent the motor from starting when associated equipment is still running. This ensures that the motor only starts under safe conditions, reducing the risk of accidents, equipment damage, or process disturbances.

ðŸŸ¦ E (Example) â€“ A Practical Use Case

Consider a chemical plant where a reactor is connected to a pump that feeds raw materials into the reactor. The motor interlock function block can be used to ensure that the pump is stopped before the motor is started. If the pump is still running, the motor interlock function block will prevent the motor from starting, preventing the reactor from receiving raw materials and potentially causing an accident.

In this example, the motor interlock function block is essential for ensuring safe operation and preventing accidents. By interlocking the motor with the status of the associated equipment, we can ensure that the motor
