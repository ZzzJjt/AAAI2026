### Intent:
**Intent Summary:**  
Create an IEC 61131-3 Structured Text function block to reliably read five process values from an IO-Link master, with error handling and status reporting for each read operation.  

*(Focus: IO-Link communication, data integrity, and diagnostic transparency in industrial automation.)*

### Prompt:
**IO-Link Data Acquisition Using 61131-3 Structured Text:**

Develop a function block in structured text (ST) based on IEC 61131 standards to read five values from a remote IO-Link master. The function block should handle communication with the IO-Link master, retrieve the required process data, and provide the status of each read operation. Discuss the methodology used for error checking, status reporting, and handling of potential communication issues between the IO-Link master and the connected devices.

**R-I-S-E:**

ðŸŸ¥ R (Role) â€“ Your Role

Act as an industrial automation engineer developing IEC 61131-3 Structured Text (ST) function blocks for device-level communication using IO-Link.

ðŸŸ© I (Input) â€“ What Youâ€™re Given

You need to create a function block that communicates with a remote IO-Link master to read five process values. The block must manage communication with the master, handle potential read errors, and report the status of each read operation. Reliability, fault tolerance, and status transparency are essential.

ðŸŸ§ S (Steps) â€“ What to Do
	1.	Define input parameters to initiate reading and identify IO-Link channels or data objects.
	2.	Implement logic to communicate with the IO-Link master and sequentially or concurrently retrieve five process values.
	3.	For each read, verify the result and generate a corresponding status output (e.g., success, timeout, CRC error).
	4.	Add error-handling routines to retry failed reads or flag issues to the controller, ensuring traceability and real-time feedback.

ðŸŸ¦ E (Expectation) â€“ What Success Looks Like

The resulting function block should reliably read five values from an IO-Link master, return those values along with individual read statuses, and provide built-in error detection. This enables real-time diagnostics, enhances data integrity, and ensures robust IO-Link communication under varying network conditions.

3.	Implement error-checking logic to detect communication issues, CRC errors, or timeout errors.
4.	Add error-handling routines to retry failed reads or flag issues to the controller.
5.	Generate status outputs for each read operation, indicating success or failure.
6.	Include documentation and comments to explain the function block's purpose, inputs, outputs, and logic.

FUNCTION_BLOCK IO_LINK_READER
VAR_INPUT
    IO_LINK_CHANNEL : INT; // IO-Link channel number
    READ_COUNT : INT; // Number of values to read
END_VAR
VAR_OUTPUT
    READ_STATUS : INT; // Status of each read operation
    READ_VALUES : ARRAY[0..READ_COUNT-1] OF INT; // Read values
END_VAR

// Initialize variables
FOR i = 0 TO READ_COUNT-1
    READ_VALUES[i] = -1; // Set initial values to -1
NEXT i

// Loop to read values from IO-Link master
FOR i = 0 TO READ_COUNT-1
    // Attempt to read value from IO-Link channel
    IF IO_LINK_CHANNEL = -1
        // Error occurred, flag the issue and retry
        READ_STATUS = i;
        RETURN;
    END_IF

    // Retrieve value from IO-Link channel
    READ_VALUES[i] = IO_LINK_CHANNEL;

    // Check for CRC error
    IF CRC_CHECK(IO_LINK_CHANNEL) = 0
        // CRC error, flag the issue and retry
        READ_STATUS = i;
        RETURN;
    END_IF

    // Update IO_LINK_CHANNEL for next read
    IO_LINK_CHANNEL = -1;
END_FOR

// All reads completed successfully
READ_STATUS = READ_COUNT;

// Return read values and status
