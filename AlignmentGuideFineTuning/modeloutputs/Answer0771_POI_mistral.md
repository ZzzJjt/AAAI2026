### Intent:
**Intent Summary:**  
Design a structured start-up and shutdown sequence in IEC 61131-3 Structured Text for a 3D pouch making machine, ensuring sequential activation/deactivation of heating/cooling stations, tension control via feeders, cutter synchronization, and safe parameterized procedures with timers and conditions.  

*(Focus: Machine sequencing, tension management, safety, and synchronization in packaging automation.)*

### Prompt:
**3D Pouch Making Machine:**

Design a detailed start-up and shutdown sequence for a 3D pouch making machine in IEC 61131-3 Structured Text. The machine consists of 8 heating stations, 8 cooling stations, one horizontal cutter, one vertical cutter, and two feeder units responsible for raw material feeding. Winding tension management is critical throughout the process to ensure proper tension in the raw material.

Write a structured start-up sequence that sequentially activates the heating and cooling stations, regulates the feeder units to maintain optimal tension, and ensures proper synchronization between the cutters and material flow. Additionally, create a shutdown sequence that safely deactivates each component in the correct order, ensuring proper cooling and tension release.

Ensure the program includes typical parameter values, timers, and conditions for each stage of the start-up and shutdown procedures, and discuss the importance of winding tension in maintaining machine efficiency and product quality.

**Start-up Sequence:**

1. Initialize variables and parameters:

```
PROGRAM Startup
VAR
  i: INT; // Loop counter
  heating_temp: REAL; // Heating temperature
  cooling_temp: REAL; // Cooling temperature
  tension: REAL; // Winding tension
  delay_time: TON; // Delay timer
  mode: BOOL; // Mode variable
END_VAR

heating_temp := 150.0; // Set heating temperature
cooling_temp := 25.0; // Set cooling temperature
tension := 10.0; // Set initial winding tension
delay_time := T#0.5s; // Set initial delay time
mode := FALSE; // Set initial mode to false (inactive)
```

2. Start heating stations:

```
FOR i := 1 TO 8 DO
  IF mode = TRUE THEN
    heating_station[i].set_temperature(heating_temp);
  END_IF
END_FOR
```

3. Start cooling stations:

```
FOR i := 1 TO 8 DO
  IF mode = TRUE THEN
    cooling_station[i].set_temperature(cooling_temp);
  END_IF
END_FOR
```

4. Start feeder units and set tension:

```
feeder_unit1.set_tension(tension);
feeder_unit2.set_tension(tension);
```

5. Start horizontal cutter:

```
horizontal_cutter.start();
```

6. Start vertical cutter:

```
vertical_cutter.start();
```

7. Set mode to active:

```
mode := TRUE;
```

8. Wait for the material to reach the desired tension:

```
WHILE (feeder_unit1.get_tension() < tension OR feeder_unit2.get_tension() < tension) DO
  TON_Wait(delay_time);
END_WHILE
```

9. Synchronize cutters and material flow:
