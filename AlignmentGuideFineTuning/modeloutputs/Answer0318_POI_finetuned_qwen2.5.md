### Intent:
**Intent Summary:**  
Develop an IEC 61131-3 Structured Text PID controller to regulate gas turbine inlet temperature by modulating an inlet valve, ensuring safe operation with clamped outputs, anti-windup, and diagnostic logging.

### Prompt:
**PID Temperature Control Gas Turbine:**

Develop a self-contained IEC 61131-3 Structured Text program to implement PID feedback control for regulating the temperature inside a gas turbine. The control program should manage the opening of an inlet valve based on a temperature setpoint, ensuring that the PID controller adjusts the valve position to maintain optimal turbine performance.

The program should include the necessary PID parameters (proportional, integral, and derivative gains) and logic to handle deviations from the temperature setpoint. Also, incorporate limits on the valve opening to ensure safe operation. Discuss the challenges of temperature regulation in gas turbines, focusing on system dynamics, response time, and maintaining stability under varying load conditions.

**C-A-R-E:**

ðŸŸ¥ C (Context) â€“ The Background

In gas turbine operation, temperature regulation is a critical control objective. Inlet temperatures that are too high can damage turbine components, while those that are too low can reduce efficiency and increase emissions. The turbine must respond rapidly to load changes and fuel variations. A robust PID control system is essential for maintaining safe and optimal operating temperatures.
