**R-I-S-E:**

üü• R (Role) ‚Äì Define Your Role

Act as a PLC software developer implementing reliable and reusable conversion utilities in IEC 61131-3 Structured Text for industrial applications.

üü© I (Input) ‚Äì Information Provided

You need to develop a function block that:
	‚Ä¢	Accepts a 10-digit decimal input (e.g., up to 9999999999)
	‚Ä¢	Converts this value to a hexadecimal representation
	‚Ä¢	Handles large values and edge cases, such as overflow risk, zero input, or maximum data type limits
	‚Ä¢	Returns the result as a STRING suitable for display, logging, or transmission
	‚Ä¢	Must be self-contained and operate safely within scan-cycle execution

‚∏ª

üüß S (Steps) ‚Äì Steps to Perform
	1.	Declare the function block with an input DecValue : LINT and an output HexString : STRING.
	2.	Initialize internal variables: remainder, digit character map (0 to F), a temporary string buffer, and a loop counter.
	3.	Implement the conversion logic using a loop:
	‚Ä¢	Divide the decimal value by 16
	‚Ä¢	Map the remainder to its corresponding hex digit
	‚Ä¢	Accumulate characters in reverse
	4.	Reverse the final result (if necessary) to correct the string order.
	5.	Add handling for special cases:
	‚Ä¢	Input = 0 ‚Üí output "0"
	‚Ä¢	Input > max LINT ‚Üí clip or raise a warning
	6.	Add inline comments explaining each major operation and safety consideration.

‚∏ª

üü¶ E (Expectation) ‚Äì Expected Outcome

The completed function block should reliably convert any valid 10-digit decimal input into a hexadecimal string, with correct formatting and protection against invalid values. It will serve as a modular utility block for various PLC programs where hexadecimal display, data formatting, or communication protocol encoding is needed.

The completed function block should reliably convert any valid 10-digit decimal input into a hexadecimal string, with correct formatting and protection against invalid values. It will serve as a modular utility block for various PLC programs where hexadecimal display, data formatting, or communication protocol encoding is needed. The self-contained nature of the function block ensures it can be easily reused in different industrial contexts without requiring additional support code.

**C-A-S-E:**

üü• C (Context) ‚Äì The Situation

In industrial automation, hexadecimal representation is often used for data transmission, configuration, or diagnostics. Converting decimal values to hexadecimal is a common task, but it can be challenging to implement safely and efficiently in IEC 61131-3 Structured Text. A self-contained function block that handles edge cases and large values would be a valuable addition to a PLC programmer's toolkit.

‚∏ª

üü© A (Action) ‚Äì What You Should Do

Develop a function block in IEC 61131-3 Structured Text that takes a 10-digit decimal value as input and returns a hexadecimal string representation. Ensure the function block handles edge cases such as zero input and large values, and provide inline comments to explain each step of the conversion process.

üüß S (Solution) ‚Äì How to Do It

Implement a function block named ‚ÄúDecToHex‚Äù with the following inputs and outputs:

	Inputs:
		DecValue: LINT (10-digit decimal value)

	Outputs:
		HexString: STRING (hexadecimal representation)

	Function:
		Convert the 10-digit decimal value to a hexadecimal string representation.

	Implementation:
		1.	Declare local variables:
			Remainder: LINT
			HexChars: CHAR[4] (0 to F)
			HexString: CHAR[10] (reverse order)
			Counter: LINT (loop counter)

		2.	Initialize HexChars with the hexadecimal character set (0 to F).

		3.	Implement the conversion logic using a loop:
			a.	Divide the decimal value by 16 and store the remainder in Remainder.
			b.	Map Remainder to its corresponding hex digit using HexChars.
			c.	Append the hex digit to HexString in reverse order.
			d.	Decrement the loop counter.

		4.	Reverse the final result if necessary.

		5.	Handle special cases:
			a.	If DecValue is 0, set HexString to "0".
			b.	If DecValue exceeds the maximum LINT value, clip it or raise a warning.

		6.	Return HexString as the output.

	7.	Include inline comments to explain
