ðŸŸ© I (Input) â€“ Information Provided

You need to implement a self-contained PID controller that:
	â€¢	Accepts configurable parameters for:
	â€¢	Proportional gain (Kp)
	â€¢	Integral gain (Ki)
	â€¢	Derivative gain (Kd)
	â€¢	Output limits (MinOutput, MaxOutput)
	â€¢	Operates on a control error calculated as:
\text{Error} = \text{Setpoint} - \text{ProcessVariable}
	â€¢	Includes input signals:
	â€¢	Enable to activate control
	â€¢	Reset to reinitialize internal states
	â€¢	Provides a real-time control output and handles error accumulation, anti-windup, and derivative filtering

ðŸŸ§ S (Steps) â€“ Steps to Perform
	1.	Declare inputs and outputs:
	â€¢	Inputs: Setpoint, ProcessVariable, Kp, Ki, Kd, MinOutput, MaxOutput, Enable, Reset
	â€¢	Outputs: ControlOutput, and optionally Error, IntegralTerm, DerivativeTerm
	2.	Initialize/reset states on rising edge of Reset signal
	3.	In the control loop (if Enable = TRUE):
	â€¢	Calculate the error
	â€¢	Update the integral term, with logic to prevent windup when output is clamped
	â€¢	Calculate the derivative term using previous ProcessVariable and DeltaT
	â€¢	Compute the PID output using the formula:
\text{Output} = Kp \cdot \text{Error} + Ki \cdot \text{Integral} - Kd \cdot \text{Derivative}
	â€¢	Apply output clamping and use flags to suspend further integration when limits are hit
	4.	Update previous process value for the next derivative calculation

ðŸŸ¦ E (Expectation) â€“ Expected Outcome

Deliver a modular, robust PID function block that:
	â€¢	Responds smoothly to changing setpoints and disturbances
	â€¢	Avoids overshoot and instability through proper tuning
	â€¢	Provides scan-cycle-safe execution with clear parameter structure
	â€¢	Can be reused across different automation tasks and systems

	â€¢	If Output < MinOutput, set Output = MinOutput and set ClampOutput = TRUE
	â€¢	If ClampOutput = TRUE, set Integral = 0 to prevent windup

ðŸŸ© I (Implementation) â€“ Additional Considerations

1.	Consider using floating-point arithmetic for improved precision and stability.
2.	Implement a function to tune the PID gains based on a step response or other tuning method.
3.	Include a function to reset the controller to its initial state, which can be called externally.
4.	Consider adding a function to calculate the controller's performance metrics, such as rise time
