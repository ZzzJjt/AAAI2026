### Intent:
The task involves developing an IEC 61131-3 Structured Text function block to manage EtherCAT slave state transitions (INITâ†’PREOPâ†’SAFEOPâ†’OP) with timed delays, state validation, and robust error handling for real-time industrial network control.

### Prompt:
**Ethernet PowerLink Diagnostics Using IEC 61131-3 Structured Text:**

Develop a function block in structured text (ST) based on IEC 61131 standards to retrieve Ethernet PowerLink diagnostic information from a control node device via a PowerLink managing node (MN). The function block should collect and display key diagnostic data such as communication status, error codes, and node health. The program must ensure that the diagnostic information is accurately processed and relayed to the controller for further analysis. Discuss how the function block interacts with the PowerLink network, handles error detection, and provides real-time diagnostics for maintaining network integrity.

ðŸŸ¥ T (Task) â€“ What You Need to Do

Develop an IEC 61131-3 Structured Text (ST) function block to retrieve and process diagnostic information from Ethernet PowerLink control nodes via a Managing Node (MN).

ðŸŸ© A (Action) â€“ How to Do It

Implement logic to cyclically collect key diagnostic data such as communication status, error codes, and node health. The function block should interact with the MN to access diagnostic registers, process and validate the received data, detect errors, and forward structured output to the controller. Include logic for fault handling and ensure that the data is refreshed in real time for monitoring and logging purposes.

ðŸŸ¦ G (Goal) â€“ What You Want to Achieve

Provide a reliable and reusable diagnostic tool that enables real-time visibility into the condition of PowerLink nodes, improves troubleshooting efficiency, and supports the long-term stability and maintainability of the communication network.

ðŸŸ¥ R (Role) â€“ Your Role

You are a PLC programmer or control systems engineer responsible for developing diagnostic tools for Ethernet PowerLink networks using IEC 61131 standards.

ðŸŸ© I (Input) â€“ What Youâ€™re Given

You are working with an Ethernet PowerLink network where diagnostic information is available through a Managing Node (MN). Your task is to retrieve and process this diagnostic data using IEC 61131-3 Structured Text (ST) to support real-time monitoring and troubleshooting.

ðŸŸ§ S (Steps) â€“ How to Do It

	1.	Define the function block interface with input pins for the PowerLink network connection and output pins for diagnostic data.
	2.	Implement logic to establish communication with the PowerLink MN using the appropriate PowerLink protocol commands.
	3.	Develop a timer or scan-cycle-driven function to retrieve diagnostic data from the control nodes, including communication status, error codes, and node health.
	4.	Process the diagnostic data, ensuring proper error handling and status validation.
	5.	Implement logic to display or log the diagnostic information in a structured format for further analysis.
	6.	Ensure that the function block interacts efficiently with the PowerLink network, with real-time updates and error detection mechanisms in place.

ðŸŸ© E (Example) â€“ How It Works

	â€¢	You are developing a function block named `EthernetPowerLink_Diagnostics` that will be called from your PLC program.
	â€¢	The function block receives a PowerLink network connection as input and outputs diagnostic data such as communication status, error codes, and node health.
	â€¢	You use PowerLink protocol commands to request diagnostic information from the control nodes, ensuring that the communication is robust and error-tolerant.
	â€¢	The function block processes the diagnostic data, handles any errors that may occur during communication, and provides a structured output that includes both normal and error conditions.
	â€¢	The diagnostic information is then relayed to the control system for real-time monitoring and troubleshooting, improving network reliability and maintenance efficiency.
