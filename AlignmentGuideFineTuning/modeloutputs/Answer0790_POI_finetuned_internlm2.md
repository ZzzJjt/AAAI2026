### Intent:
**Intent Summary:**  
Create a reusable IEC 61131-3 timer function block with configurable duration, start/stop controls, and real-time status outputs (running, done, remaining time) for industrial PLC applications.  

*(Focus: Modularity, scan-cycle efficiency, and precise timing logic.)*

### Prompt:
**Timer:**
Implement a self-contained function block in IEC 61131-3 structured text to create a timer. Include configurable time duration, start/stop controls, and timeout handling.

**R-T-F:**

🟥 R (Role) – Define Your Role

Act as a PLC programmer tasked with implementing a customizable timer function block using IEC 61131-3 Structured Text, suitable for precise and reusable industrial control logic.

⸻

🟩 T (Task) – Define the Objective

Develop a self-contained timer function block that includes:
	•	A configurable time duration input (PresetTime : TIME)
	•	Start and Stop Boolean inputs to control timing behavior
	•	Accurate elapsed time tracking
	•	Output flags to indicate timer status:
	•	Running : BOOL — timer is active
	•	Done : BOOL — timer has reached the preset time
	•	Optionally, RemainingTime : TIME

The timer must operate in a scan-cycle-compatible and modular way, with clean state handling and timeout logic.

⸻

🟧 F (Format) – Specify the Output Format

Provide a complete IEC 61131-3 Structured Text function block that includes:
	•	Inputs:
	•	Start : BOOL
	•	Stop : BOOL
	•	PresetTime : TIME
	•	Outputs:
	•	Running : BOOL
	•	Done : BOOL
	•	RemainingTime : TIME (optional)
	•	Internal Variables:
	•	StartTime : TIME
	•	ElapsedTime : TIME
	•	TriggerEdge : BOOL
	•	Logic Flow:
	•	Edge detection for Start
	•	Reset logic on Stop
	•	Time comparison to set Done and clear Running
