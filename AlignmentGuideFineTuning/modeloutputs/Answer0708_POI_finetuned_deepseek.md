### Intent:
"Implement a Python-based Model Predictive Control (MPC) algorithm to optimize turbine performance in a thermal power plant by modeling thermal dynamics, handling operational constraints, and maintaining efficiency under varying loads."

### Prompt:
**Model Predictive Control for Turbine Optimization in a Thermal Power Plant Using Python:**

Develop Python code to implement a model predictive control (MPC) algorithm for optimizing the operation of a turbine in a thermal power plant. The MPC should account for operational constraints, energy efficiency, and thermal dynamics, while ensuring robust performance under varying load conditions and external disturbances.

**R-T-F:**

ðŸŸ¥ Rï¼ˆRoleï¼‰

Act as a Python developer focused on energy systems modeling and advanced process control in thermal power plants.

ðŸŸ© Tï¼ˆTaskï¼‰

Develop Python code to implement a model predictive control (MPC) algorithm for optimizing turbine performance in a thermal power plant. The controller must consider dynamic thermal behavior, operational constraints, energy efficiency goals, and external disturbances, while maintaining stable and adaptive performance under varying load conditions.

ðŸŸ§ Fï¼ˆFormatï¼‰

Provide a Python script that includes:
	â€¢	A dynamic model of the turbineâ€™s thermal behavior
	â€¢	An MPC algorithm implementation with predictive horizon and constraints
	â€¢	Simulation logic for varying load conditions and external disturbances
	â€¢	Text-based or logged output (e.g., control actions, energy use, system stability metrics)
