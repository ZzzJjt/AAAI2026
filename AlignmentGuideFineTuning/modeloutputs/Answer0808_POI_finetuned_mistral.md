### Intent:
The task is to implement an artificial neural network (ANN)-based controller in Python to regulate temperature in a chemical reactor with nonlinear dynamics, comparing its performance against traditional PID control through simulation.

### Prompt:
**Model Predictive Control for Turbine Optimization in a Thermal Power Plant Using Python:**

Develop Python code to implement a model predictive control (MPC) algorithm for optimizing the operation of a turbine in a thermal power plant. The MPC should account for operational constraints, energy efficiency, and thermal dynamics, while ensuring robust performance under varying load conditions and external disturbances.

**T-A-G:**

ðŸŸ¥ Tï¼ˆTaskï¼‰

Implement a model predictive control (MPC) system in Python to optimize the operation of a turbine in a thermal power plant.

ðŸŸ© Aï¼ˆActionï¼‰
