**Assumptions:**

1. The distillation column is a well-mixed, continuous stirred tank reactor (CSTR) with a constant reflux ratio.
2. The column is operating under steady-state conditions.
3. The feed rate is the only manipulated variable.
4. The temperature is the controlled variable.
5. The model is linearized around the operating point.
6. The MPC controller uses a simple linear state-space model.

**Constraints:**

1. The feed rate must be within a certain range (e.g., 0.5-1.5 times the steady-state feed rate).
2. The temperature must be within a certain range (e.g., 50-70 degrees Celsius).

**Evaluation Criteria:**

The evaluation will be based on the following criteria:

1. Correctness of the MATLAB code in modeling the distillation column dynamics and implementing MPC.
2. Satisfactory fulfillment of the constraints during the simulation.
3. Optimization of the distillation process as evidenced by improved performance metrics (e.g., product purity, yield, energy efficiency).

**Additional Notes:**

- The provided task is a simplified version of a real-world problem. Real-world applications may require more complex models and control strategies.
- The evaluation will not include a detailed analysis of the model's accuracy or the robustness of the MPC controller. The focus is on the implementation of the requested features.
- The code should be well-commented and follow MATLAB best practices for readability and maintainability.
