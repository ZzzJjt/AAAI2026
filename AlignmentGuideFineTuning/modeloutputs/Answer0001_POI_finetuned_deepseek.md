### Intent:
**Intent Summary:**  
Implement an MPC-based trajectory control system for aircraft using a simplified 3DOF dynamics model in MATLAB, optimizing thrust, lift, and bank angle to track a reference trajectory while handling disturbances like wind and thermals.  

*(Focus: Aircraft trajectory control, MPC optimization, nonlinear dynamics, disturbance rejection, MATLAB/CasADi implementation.)*

### Prompt:
**Artificial Neural Network Control for Temperature Regulation in a Chemical Reactor Using Python:**

**Origin**

Develop Python code to implement an artificial neural network (ANN) for advanced process control of the temperature in a chemical reactor. The control system should leverage the predictive and adaptive capabilities of ANNs to manage the reactorâ€™s temperature, considering the nonlinear and time-varying nature of the reactorâ€™s dynamics. Train the ANN using historical process data to optimize temperature control, ensuring stability and efficiency under varying operational conditions.

Implement Python code to simulate the chemical reactorâ€™s temperature control dynamics and demonstrate how ANN-based control can outperform traditional methods in handling complex, nonlinear systems.

**B-A-B**

ðŸŸ¥ Bï¼ˆBeforeï¼‰

Traditional PID controllers struggle to manage the nonlinear and time-varying dynamics of chemical reactor temperature control, leading to suboptimal performance and reduced efficiency under fluctuating operating conditions.

ðŸŸ© Aï¼ˆAfterï¼‰

Develop and implement Python code for an artificial neural network (ANN)-based control system that significantly enhances temperature stability and process efficiency. The system should adapt to dynamic changes and outperform conventional control methods.

ðŸŸ§ Bï¼ˆBridgeï¼‰

Train the ANN using historical process data and design a simulation model in Python that reflects the reactorâ€™s dynamic behavior. Demonstrate the performance improvement by comparing ANN-based control results against those from traditional controllers, especially under nonlinear and time-varying scenarios.
