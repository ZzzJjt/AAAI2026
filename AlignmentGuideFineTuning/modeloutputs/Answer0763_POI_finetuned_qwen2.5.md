### Intent:
The task is to rewrite a traffic light control PLC program using IEC 61131-3 Structured Text that properly implements a state machine with timer-based light sequencing, handles pedestrian requests and emergency vehicle priority, while avoiding scan-cycle blocking and improper timer usage.

### Prompt:
**Fix Traffic Light Code:**

Can you find the error in the following 61131-3 ST code: PROGRAM TrafficLightControl VAR pedestrianButtonPressed: BOOL; emergencyVehicleApproaching: BOOL; greenLightOn: BOOL; yellowLightOn: BOOL; redLightOn: BOOL; timer: TON; // timer to control the duration of green and yellow lights END_VAR

// Initialize the program greenLightOn := TRUE; yellowLightOn := FALSE; redLightOn := FALSE; timer(IN := NOT emergencyVehicleApproaching, PT := T#5s);

// Main program loop WHILE TRUE DO // Check for pedestrian button press pedestrianButtonPressed := ReadPedestrianButton();

// Check for emergency vehicle approaching
emergencyVehicleApproaching := ReadEmergencyVehicleSensor();

IF emergencyVehicleApproaching THEN
    // Turn off all lights and turn on green light for emergency vehicle
    greenLightOn := TRUE;
    yellowLightOn := FALSE;
    redLightOn := FALSE;
    timer(IN := FALSE);

ELSEIF pedestrianButtonPressed THEN
    // Turn off all lights and turn on red light and pedestrian light
    greenLightOn := FALSE;
    yellowLightOn := FALSE;
    redLightOn := TRUE;
    timer(IN := FALSE);

    // Wait for pedestrian to cross
    WAIT UNTIL NOT pedestrianButtonPressed;

    // Turn on yellow light for warning and start the timer
    yellowLightOn := TRUE;
    redLightOn := FALSE;
    timer(IN := NOT emergencyVehicleApproaching);

ELSE
    // Check the timer and switch to the next light if it's time
    IF timer.Q THEN
        IF greenLightOn THEN
            greenLightOn := FALSE;
            yellowLightOn := TRUE;
            timer(IN := NOT emergencyVehicleApproaching);

        ELSEIF yellowLightOn THEN
            yellowLightOn := FALSE;
            redLightOn := TRUE;
            timer(IN := FALSE);

        ELSE // red light is on
            redLightOn := FALSE;
            greenLightOn := TRUE;
            timer(IN := NOT emergencyVehicleApproaching);
        END_IF;
    END_IF;
END_IF;

// Set the traffic lights based on the variables
SetTrafficLights(greenLightOn, yellowLightOn, redLightOn);

// Wait for a short time before checking again
DELAY 100ms;

END_WHILE

// Read the pedestrian button state from an input FUNCTION ReadPedestrianButton: BOOL // Code to read the input goes here END_FUNCTION

// Read the emergency vehicle sensor state from an input FUNCTION ReadEmergencyVehicleSensor: BOOL // Code to read the input goes here END_FUNCTION

ðŸŸ¥ R (Role) â€“ Your Role

You are a PLC automation engineer reviewing a Structured Text (ST) program written according to IEC 61131-3 standards. Your job is to identify and fix errors in the traffic light control logic so it correctly handles normal operation, pedestrian button requests, and emergency vehicle detectionâ€”all within the scan-cycle execution model.

â¸»

ðŸŸ© T (Task) â€“ What You Need to Do

Evaluate the provided program and:
	1.	Remove non-compliant constructs, such as:
	â€¢	WHILE TRUE DO â€” which blocks the PLC scan cycle
	â€¢	WAIT UNTIL â€” not allowed in standard PLC structured text
	2.	Correct the misuse of the TON timer:
	â€¢	Prevent repeated reinitialization of timer(IN := â€¦) within the same scan
	3.	Implement a state machine for traffic light sequencing:
	â€¢	States could include: NORMAL_GREEN, TO_YELLOW, TO_RED, PEDESTRIAN_CROSS, EMERGENCY
	4.	Use rising edge detection (R_TRIG) for handling one-time button presses
	5.	Ensure light transitions are clean, mutually exclusive, and predictable

â¸»

ðŸŸ¦ F (Format) â€“ What the Output Should Look Like
	â€¢	A cyclically executing PLC program that:
	â€¢	Responds to pedestrian requests with a controlled red-light phase
	â€¢	Immediately switches to green for emergency vehicles, overriding others
	â€¢	Uses a TON timer once per phase, without re-triggering it improperly
	â€¢	Organizes transitions using a CASE-based state machine
	â€¢	Sets traffic light outputs once per scan based on the current state
