### Intent:
**Intent Summary:**  
Create an IEC 61131-3 Structured Text program to maintain a 2:1 ratio between two reactant flows (A:B) by dynamically adjusting flow rates, ensuring consistent chemical composition despite disturbances.  

*(Focus: Ratio control logic, real-time flow adjustment, and disturbance handling for mixing processes.)*

### Prompt:
**Ratio Control Mixing:**

Develop a self-contained IEC 61131-3 Structured Text program (not a function block) to implement ratio control for mixing two reactants in a 2:1 ratio. The program should maintain the desired ratio between the two reactants by adjusting their flow rates dynamically, ensuring that for every two parts of reactant A, one part of reactant B is added.

Include logic to monitor the flow rates of both reactants and adjust one flow rate relative to the other to maintain the 2:1 ratio. The program should also handle any disturbances or variations in flow, adjusting the control signals to correct for deviations from the target ratio. Discuss the importance of ratio control in maintaining the desired chemical composition and the impact of disturbances on the mixing process.

**B-A-B:**

ðŸŸ¥ B (Before) â€“ The Challenge

In continuous chemical mixing processes, maintaining the correct mixing ratio of reactants is essential for ensuring product quality and process efficiency. Without ratio control, deviations in flow due to pump inconsistencies or process disturbances can result in incorrect formulations, leading to off-spec products, waste, or even hazardous reactions.

ðŸŸ© A (After) â€“ The Ideal Outcome

Create a self-contained IEC 61131-3 Structured Text program (not a function block) that:
	â€¢	Implements ratio control to mix two reactants in a 2:1 ratio (A:B)
	â€¢	Dynamically adjusts flow rates in real time to maintain the ratio despite disturbances
	â€¢	Continuously monitors the flow of both reactants and recalculates the required flow rate of B based on A
	â€¢	Reacts to deviations by correcting the flow control signal to restore the correct ratio
	â€¢	Ensures stable and accurate chemical composition in the final mixed product

ðŸŸ§ B (Bridge) â€“ The Implementation Strategy

Hereâ€™s an example Structured Text implementation of the ratio control logic:

VAR
    Flow_A_PV : REAL;               // Measured flow rate of reactant A
    Flow_B_PV : REAL;               // Measured flow rate of reactant B
    Flow_B_SP : REAL;               // Setpoint flow for reactant B

    Ratio_Setpoint : REAL := 2.0;   // Desired ratio A:B = 2:1
    Tolerance : REAL := 0.05;       // Acceptable ratio error margin

    Actual_Ratio : REAL;
    Error : REAL;
END_VAR

// Calculate actual ratio
IF Flow_B_PV > 0.0 THEN
    Actual_Ratio := Flow_A_PV / Flow_B_PV;
ELSE
    Actual_Ratio := 0.0;
END_IF

// Calculate target flow for reactant B
Flow_B_SP := Flow_A_PV / Ratio_Setpoint;

// Check deviation
Error := Actual_Ratio - Ratio_Setpoint;

// Optional: Take action if Error exceeds tolerance
// (e.g., raise an alarm, adjust valves, etc.)

// Flow_B_SP can be sent to a PID loop or analog output to control pump B

    Flow_B_PV : REAL;               // Measured flow rate of reactant B

Error := Actual_Ratio - Ratio_Setpoint;

// Optional: Take action if Error exceeds tolerance
// (e.g., raise an alarm, adjust valves, etc.)

// Flow_B_SP can be sent to a PID loop or analog output to control pump B
This logic:
	â€¢	Monitors the actual ratio by dividing the flow of A by the flow of B
	â€¢	Calculates the required flow of B to maintain the 2:1 ratio
	â€¢	Adjusts in real time to compensate for disturbances
	â€¢	Ensures that the ratio is maintained even under varying flow conditions

You can also extend this logic to include safety limits, alarms, or manual override capabilities as needed.

This ratio control approach is crucial in maintaining consistent product quality, reducing waste, and ensuring safe and efficient chemical reactions.
