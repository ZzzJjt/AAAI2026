ðŸŸ¥ R (Role) â€“ Your Role

You are a PLC programmer or automation engineer responsible for creating a reusable function block that performs linear interpolation in real-time industrial control systems using IEC 61131-3 Structured Text.

ðŸŸ© I (Input) â€“ What Youâ€™re Given

You need to develop a function block that:
	â€¢	Accepts five inputs:
	â€¢	X1, Y1: Coordinates of the first known point
	â€¢	X2, Y2: Coordinates of the second known point
	â€¢	X: A query input value to interpolate
	â€¢	Returns one output:
	â€¢	Y: The interpolated result
	â€¢	Implements the formula:
Y := Y1 + ((X - X1) \times (Y2 - Y1)) / (X2 - X1)
	â€¢	Is safe, efficient, and includes inline comments for maintainability
	â€¢	Addresses precision concerns and real-time performance requirements on PLCs

ðŸŸ§ S (Steps) â€“ What You Need to Do
	1.	Define the function block interface:
 FUNCTION_BLOCK LinearInterpolation
VAR_INPUT
    X1, Y1, X2, Y2, X : REAL;
END_VAR
VAR_OUTPUT
    Y : REAL;
END_VAR
	2.	Implement the interpolation logic with error handling:
 IF X2 <> X1 THEN
    Y := Y1 + ((X - X1) * (Y2 - Y1)) / (X2 - X1);
ELSE
    Y := Y1; // Fallback to avoid division by zero
END_IF;
	3.	Add inline comments explaining:
	â€¢	The interpolation formula
	â€¢	Division-by-zero checks
	â€¢	Considerations for REAL-type rounding and overflow behavior
	4.	Test the function block using representative use cases (e.g., analog scaling, position control) and validate accuracy under expected PLC scan cycles.

ðŸŸ¦ E (Expectation) â€“ What Success Looks Like

You deliver a robust and efficient interpolation function block that:
	â€¢	Accurately estimates values between two known points
	â€¢	Executes quickly enough for real-time control applications
	â€¢	Is platform-independent, reusable, and easy to maintain
	â€¢	Prevents errors due to division by zero and minimizes rounding impacts

It enhances system flexibility, supporting scalable applications like sensor conversion, control curves, or recipe scaling.

**Linear Interpolation Function Block in IEC 61131-3 Structured Text**

```structuredtext
FUNCTION_BLOCK LinearInterpolation
VAR_INPUT
    X1, Y1, X2, Y2, X : REAL;
END_VAR
VAR_OUTPUT
    Y : REAL;
END_VAR

// Interpolation formula: Y = Y1 + ((X - X1) * (Y2 - Y1)) / (X2 - X1)
// This formula calculates the interpolated value Y for a given X between two known points (X1, Y1) and (X2, Y2).

// Check for division by zero to prevent runtime errors
IF X2 <> X1 THEN
    Y := Y1 + ((X - X1) * (Y2 - Y1)) / (X2 - X1);
ELSE
    Y := Y1; // Fallback to avoid division by zero
END_IF;

// Considerations for REAL-type rounding and overflow behavior:
// - The REAL type in PLCs typically has a limited precision, which can lead to rounding errors.
// - To minimize these errors, ensure that the inputs are within the representable range of the REAL type.
// - For critical applications, consider using fixed-point arithmetic or higher-precision data types if available.

// Test the function block using representative use cases:
// - Analog scaling: Use the function block to convert sensor readings to a desired scale.
// - Position control: Apply the function block to interpolate positions between two points in a control system.
// - Recipe scaling: Use the function block to scale recipe parameters based on input conditions.

// The function block is designed to be reusable and easy to maintain, promoting code reuse and reducing development time.
// It enhances system flexibility, supporting scalable applications like sensor conversion, control curves, or recipe scaling.
// The function block is a valuable addition to the automation engineer's toolkit, promoting code reuse and reducing development time.
