### Intent:
**Intent Summary:**  
Create an automated control system for LNG vaporization with instrumentation (flow, temperature, valves) to regulate the process from storage to gas output.  

*(Focused on LNG flow/temperature control with valves and meters, analogous to the beer brewing process's need for setpoints and instrumentation.)*

### Prompt:
**Control Narrative Beer Brewing:**

Create a control narrative for beer brewing including concrete setpoints and ranges.

Create a detailed explanation of the Lautering process (Section 4). Include the equipment and instrumentation needed. Provide a list of the steps to execute.

**T-A-G:**

ðŸŸ¥ T (Task)

Create a control narrative for an automated beer brewing process, with emphasis on specifying concrete setpoints and detailing the lautering phase (Section 4).

â¸»

ðŸŸ© A (Action)
	â€¢	Define the brewing process stages, including specific setpoints and control ranges for parameters like temperature, flow rate, and volume.
	â€¢	In Section 4 â€“ Lautering, include:
	â€¢	A list of required equipment: lauter tun, rake motor, sparge system, wort pump
	â€¢	A list of required instrumentation: turbidity meter, flow transmitter, level sensor, temperature probe
	â€¢	A step-by-step procedure for the lautering process, such as:
	1.	Start recirculation of wort
	2.	Monitor turbidity; wait until it drops below 200 NTU
	3.	Begin transferring wort to the kettle
	4.	Add sparge water at 76â€¯Â°C to maintain lauter tun level between 60â€“80%
	5.	Stop process based on turbidity or volume criteria
	â€¢	Include interlock logic, such as:
	â€¢	IF Turbidity > Limit THEN open waste valve
	â€¢	IF Level < Minimum THEN stop sparging

â¸»

ðŸŸ¦ G (Goal)

Deliver a clear, structured, and automation-ready control narrative that can be used by control engineers, brewers, and programmers to ensure consistency, quality, and operational reliability in the beer brewing processâ€”especially during the critical lautering phase.
