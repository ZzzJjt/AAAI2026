ðŸŸ© A (Action)
	â€¢	Define the process context: continuous neutralization of nitric acid with ammonia in a stirred reactor
	â€¢	Include concrete setpoints and ranges for critical parameters:
	â€¢	Temperature: 175â€¯Â°C Â± 2â€¯Â°C
	â€¢	Pressure: 4.8â€¯bar Â± 0.2â€¯bar
	â€¢	Ammonia-to-acid molar ratio: 1.01:1
	â€¢	pH range: 6.2 Â± 0.3
	â€¢	Specify the instrumentation and control elements:
	â€¢	TIC-101 (reactor temperature controller), PIC-102 (pressure), FIC-103/104 (flow control), AIC-105 (pH)
	â€¢	Outline the operating sequence:
	1.	Startup: Valve alignment, flow ramp-up, temperature control, pH stabilization
	2.	Normal operation: Maintain loop control with alarm monitoring
	3.	Shutdown: Stop feeds, isolate reactor, relieve pressure
	â€¢	Define interlocks and alarm logic:
	â€¢	Trip if pressure > 5.2 bar
	â€¢	Emergency shutdown if temperature > 185â€¯Â°C
	â€¢	Reduce ammonia feed if pH < 5.5
