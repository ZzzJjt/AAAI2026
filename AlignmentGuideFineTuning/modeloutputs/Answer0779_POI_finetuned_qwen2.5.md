### Intent:
**Intent Summary:**  
Develop an IEC 61131-3 Structured Text program to automate the safe startup of a Valmet paper machine's press section, including sequential activation of rolls/conveyors, controlled ramping of speed (up to 500 m/min), nip pressure (250 kN/m), and temperature (85â€“90Â°C), with integrated safety interlocks and synchronization logic to prevent sheet/equipment damage.  

*(Focus: Modular ST code with phased control, parameter ramping, and safety checks.)*

### Prompt:
**Startup Paper Machine:**

Develop a detailed startup sequence for the press section of a Valmet paper machine, specifying typical parameter values such as press roll speed, nip pressure, and temperature settings. The sequence should include the step-by-step activation of the press section components, ensuring proper synchronization between the rolls and conveyors, and gradually ramping up to the operational speed.

Write a self-contained IEC 61131-3 Structured Text program to control this startup sequence. The program should include logic for managing interlocks, safety checks, and smooth transitions between startup phases. Discuss the significance of maintaining optimal nip pressure and temperature throughout the process to prevent damage to the paper sheet and equipment.
