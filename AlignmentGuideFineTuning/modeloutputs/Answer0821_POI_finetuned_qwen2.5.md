### Intent:
**Intent Summary:**  
Create a Structured Text function block to dynamically register/deregister CANOpen PDOs (Process Data Objects) or Layer 2 messages, with options to clear all registrations and buffer data, while ensuring robust error handling and network stability.  

*(Focus: CANOpen PDO management via ST, runtime flexibility, and safety.)*

### Prompt:
**CANOpen PDO Registration Using 61131-3 Structured Text:**

Develop a structured text (ST) function block named CAN_REGISTER_COBID based on IEC 61131 standards. The block will be responsible for registering or deleting a PDO (Process Data Object) or CAN Layer 2 message for reception by the network layer. When the REGISTER input is set to TRUE, the specified COBID (CAN identifier) will be registered for receiving messages. If REGISTER is set to FALSE, the registration of the respective COBID will be deleted. Additionally, when REGISTER is FALSE and COBID is set to 0, all registrations and messages stored in the network layer buffer will be cleared. Discuss the function blockâ€™s implementation, including error handling, network communication management, and memory buffer clearing mechanisms.

**T-A-G:**

ðŸŸ¥ T (Task) â€“ What You Need to Do

Design a Structured Text (ST) function block named CAN_REGISTER_COBID using the IEC 61131-3 standard to manage registration and deregistration of PDOs or CAN Layer 2 messages in a CANOpen network.

ðŸŸ© A (Action) â€“ How to Do It

Implement logic so that when REGISTER = TRUE, the function block registers the specified COBID for receiving messages. When REGISTER = FALSE, it removes the registration. If REGISTER = FALSE and COBID = 0, the function block should clear all registrations and network buffer data. Include robust error handling, communication status checks, and safe memory buffer management within the function block.

ðŸŸ¦ G (Goal) â€“ What Success Looks Like

Enable dynamic and reliable management of CANOpen message registrations during runtime, ensuring communication stability, flexibility, and system safety across changing operational requirements.

**R-I-S-E:**

ðŸŸ¥ R (Role) â€“ Your Role

You are a PLC programmer or automation engineer responsible for implementing network communication management in a CANOpen-based industrial control system using IEC 61131-3 Structured Text.

ðŸŸ© I (Input) â€“ What Youâ€™re Given

You need to create a function block that manages the registration and deregistration of Process Data Objects (PDOs) or CAN Layer 2 messages. The function block must handle three inputs:
	â€¢ REGISTER: A boolean flag to control registration (TRUE) or deregistration (FALSE).
	â€¢ COBID: The identifier of the PDO or CAN Layer 2 message to be registered or deregistered.
	â€¢ CLEAR_BUFFER: A boolean flag to clear all registrations and messages stored in the network layer buffer when set to TRUE.

ðŸŸ§ S (Steps) â€“ How to Do It

	1.	Define the function block with the specified inputs and outputs:
	â€¢	Inputs:
	â€¢	â€¢ REGISTER: BOOL
	â€¢	â€¢ COBID: DWORD
	â€¢	â€¢ CLEAR_BUFFER: BOOL
	â€¢	â€¢ CANOpen network layer status (optional)
	â€¢	â€¢ Error handling flags (optional)
	â€¢	â€¢ CANOpen network layer buffer status (optional)
	â€¢	Outputs:
	â€¢	â€¢ Registration status (optional)
	â€¢	â€¢ Error status (optional)
	â€¢	â€¢ Network buffer status (optional)
	2.	Implement logic to handle registration and deregistration:
	â€¢	When REGISTER is TRUE, register the specified COBID for receiving messages.
	â€¢	When REGISTER is FALSE, deregister the specified COBID.
	â€¢	When REGISTER is FALSE and COBID is 0, clear all registrations and messages stored in the network layer buffer.
	3.	Include error handling and network communication management:
	â€¢	Implement checks for network layer status and error conditions.
	â€¢	Manage network buffer clearing and ensure proper memory handling.
	â€¢	Provide status outputs for registration, error, and network buffer conditions.

ðŸŸ© E (Example) â€“ What It Should Look Like

	â€¢	Inputs:
	â€¢	â€¢ REGISTER = TRUE
	â€¢	â€¢ COBID = 100
	â€¢	â€¢ CLEAR_BUFFER = FALSE
	â€¢	â€¢ CANOpen network layer status = Busy
	â€¢	â€¢ Error
