### Intent:
**Intent Summary:**  
Create a reusable IEC 61131-3 Structured Text function block to perform an efficient binary search on a sorted 100-integer array with input validation, boundary management, and real-time PLC compatibility.  

*(Key focus: Binary search, structured text, PLC, input validation, real-time safety)*

### Prompt:
**Binary Search:**
Implement a self-contained function block in IEC 61131-3 structured text to perform a binary search on an array of 100 integers. Include input validation and efficient handling of search boundaries.

**R-I-S-E:**

ðŸŸ¥ R (Role) â€“ Define Your Role

Act as a PLC programmer tasked with developing a reusable and efficient search utility in IEC 61131-3 Structured Text for use in real-time automation systems.

ðŸŸ© I (Input) â€“ Information Provided

You are to implement a binary search algorithm within a function block that operates on an array of 100 integers. The function must:
	â€¢	Accept a sorted array, a target value, and an enable trigger
	â€¢	Perform input validation (e.g., index bounds, empty range)
	â€¢	Efficiently manage search boundaries (low, high, mid)
	â€¢	Return both a boolean flag (Found) and the index where the value was located (or -1 if not found)

â¸»

ðŸŸ§ S (Steps) â€“ Steps to Perform
	1.	Define a function block interface with inputs:
	â€¢	SearchArray : ARRAY[1..100] OF INT
	â€¢	TargetValue : INT
	â€¢	Enable : BOOL
	2.	Add internal variables for Low, High, Mid, and Found.
	3.	Use a WHILE loop to implement binary search logic:
	â€¢	Compare the middle element with the target
	â€¢	Adjust Low or High accordingly
	â€¢	Break on match or conclude if Low > High
	4.	Output:
	â€¢	Found : BOOL
	â€¢	Index : INT (valid index or -1)
	5.	Include input validation and comment the logic for maintainability.

â¸»

ðŸŸ¦ E (Expectation) â€“ Expected Outcome

Deliver a robust, reusable Structured Text function block that efficiently performs binary search on a fixed-size array. The implementation should be:
	â€¢	Scan-cycle safe for use in real-time PLC environments
	â€¢	Modular, with clear documentation and boundary checks
	â€¢	Adaptable for future use cases involving longer arrays or dynamic array sizes (with minor modifications)

ðŸŸ¦ E (Expectation) â€“ Expected Outcome

Deliver a robust, reusable Structured Text function block that efficiently performs binary search on a fixed-size array. The implementation should be:
	â€¢	Scan-cycle safe for use in real-time PLC environments
	â€¢	Modular, with clear documentation and boundary checks
	â€¢	Adaptable for future use cases involving longer arrays or dynamic array sizes (with minor modifications) To create a reusable IEC 61131-3 Structured Text function block for performing a binary search on a sorted array of 100 integers, follow these steps:

### Step 1: Define the Function Block Interface

```structuredtext
FUNCTION_BLOCK BinarySearch
VAR_INPUT
    SearchArray : ARRAY[1..100] OF INT;
    TargetValue : INT;
    Enable : BOOL;
END_VAR

VAR_OUTPUT
    Found : BOOL;
    Index : INT;
END_VAR
```

### Step 2: Initialize Internal Variables

```structuredtext
VAR
    Low : INT := 1;
    High : INT := 100;
    Mid : INT;
    Found : BOOL := FALSE;
    Index : INT := -1;
END_VAR
```

### Step 3: Implement Binary Search Logic

```structuredtext
WHILE Enable AND (Low <= High) DO
    Mid := (Low + High) DIV 2;
    IF SearchArray[Mid] = TargetValue THEN
        Found := TRUE;
        Index := Mid;
        BREAK;
    ELSIF SearchArray[Mid] < TargetValue THEN
        Low := Mid + 1;
    ELSE
        High := Mid - 1;
    END_IF;
END_WHILE;
```

### Step 4: Output Results

```structuredtext
Found := FALSE;
Index := -1;
```

### Step 5: Include Input Validation

```structuredtext
IF NOT Enable THEN
    Found := FALSE;
    Index := -1;
END_IF;
```

### Complete Function Block

```structuredtext
FUNCTION_BLOCK BinarySearch
VAR_INPUT
    SearchArray : ARRAY[1..100] OF INT;
    TargetValue : INT;
    Enable : BOOL;
END_VAR

VAR_OUTPUT
    Found : BOOL;
    Index : INT;
END_VAR

VAR
    Low : INT := 1;
    High : INT := 100;
    Mid : INT;
    Found : BOOL := FALSE;
    Index : INT := -1;
END_VAR

WHILE Enable AND (Low <= High) DO
    Mid := (Low + High) DIV 2;
    IF SearchArray[Mid] = TargetValue THEN
        Found := TRUE;
        Index := Mid;
        BREAK;
    ELSIF SearchArray[Mid] < TargetValue THEN
        Low := Mid + 1;
    ELSE
        High := Mid -
