### Intent:
**Intent Summary:**  
Create a reusable IEC 61131-3 Structured Text function block to convert 10-digit decimal values (up to 9999999999) into hexadecimal strings, ensuring robust handling of edge cases (zero, overflow) and returning a formatted result for industrial applications.

### Prompt:
**DecToHex:**
Implement a self-contained function block in IEC 61131-3 structured text to convert a 10-digit decimal value to hexadecimal. Ensure proper handling of large values and edge cases.

**R-I-S-E:**

ðŸŸ© I (Input) â€“ Information Provided

You need to develop a function block that:
	â€¢	Accepts a 10-digit decimal input (e.g., up to 9999999999)
	â€¢	Converts this value to a hexadecimal representation
	â€¢	Handles large values and edge cases, such as overflow risk, zero input, or maximum data type limits
	â€¢	Returns the result as a STRING suitable for display, logging, or transmission
	â€¢	Must be self-contained and operate safely within scan-cycle execution

â¸»

ðŸŸ§ S (Steps) â€“ Steps to Perform
	1.	Declare the function block with an input DecValue : LINT and an output HexString : STRING.
	2.	Initialize internal variables: remainder, digit character map (0 to F), a temporary string buffer, and a loop counter.
	3.	Implement the conversion logic using a loop:
	â€¢	Divide the decimal value by 16
	â€¢	Map the remainder to its corresponding hex digit
	â€¢	Accumulate characters in reverse
	4.	Reverse the final result (if necessary) to correct the string order.
	5.	Add handling for special cases:
	â€¢	Input = 0 â†’ output "0"
	â€¢	Input > max LINT â†’ clip or raise a warning
	6.	Add inline comments explaining each major operation and safety consideration.

ðŸŸ¦ E (Expectation) â€“ Expected Outcome

The completed function block should reliably convert any valid 10-digit decimal input into a hexadecimal string, with correct formatting and protection against invalid values. It will serve as a modular utility block for various PLC programs where hexadecimal display, data formatting, or communication protocol encoding is needed.

The completed function block should reliably convert any valid 10-digit decimal input into a hexadecimal string, with correct formatting and protection against invalid values. It will serve as a modular utility block for various PLC programs where hexadecimal display, data formatting, or communication protocol encoding is needed. The function block should be robust, efficient, and easy to integrate into larger systems.

**DecToHex:**
```structuredtext
FUNCTION_BLOCK DecToHex
VAR_INPUT
    DecValue : LINT; // Input decimal value (up to 9999999999)
END_VAR
VAR_OUTPUT
    HexString : STRING; // Output hexadecimal string
END_VAR

VAR
    remainder : INT; // Temporary variable for division remainder
    digitMap : ARRAY[0..15] OF CHAR := "0123456789ABCDEF"; // Hex digit map
    tempBuffer : STRING := ""; // Temporary string buffer
    i : INT := 0; // Loop counter
END_VAR

// Conversion logic
FOR i := 0 TO 15 DO
    remainder := DecValue MOD 16;
    tempBuffer := digitMap[remainder] & tempBuffer;
    DecValue := DecValue DIV 16;
END_FOR;

// Handle special cases
IF DecValue = 0 THEN
    HexString := "0";
ELSEIF DecValue > 9999999999 THEN
    // Handle overflow or raise a warning
    HexString := "Overflow";
ELSE
    HexString := tempBuffer;
END_IF;
```

This function block takes a 10-digit decimal value as input and converts it to a hexadecimal string. It includes handling for edge cases such as zero input and overflow. The result is returned as a STRING, suitable for display, logging, or transmission. The function block is designed to be self-contained and operate safely within scan-cycle execution.
