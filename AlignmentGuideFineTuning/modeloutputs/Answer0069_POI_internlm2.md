	•	Discuss that sine values are periodic and bounded between -1 and 1

**Discussion:**

The SineFunction block provides a reusable solution for computing the sine of an angle in radians. It offers two modes of operation: using the built-in SIN() function if available, or employing a Taylor series approximation for environments without SIN(). The function block is modular, with clear comments explaining the mathematical operations and precision considerations.

The use of radians is recommended over degrees, as radians are a more natural unit for trigonometric functions. The sine function is periodic, with a period of 2π radians, and its values are bounded between -1 and 1. The Taylor series approximation is most accurate near zero, and large angles should be normalized to improve precision.

In terms of performance, using the built-in SIN() function is generally faster and more accurate than the Taylor series approximation. However, the approximation can be useful in resource-constrained environments or when real-time constraints are more critical than absolute accuracy. The choice between the two modes should be based on the specific requirements of the application and the capabilities of the PLC platform.

To ensure the function block's accuracy, it is essential to test it with various angles and compare the results to a known reference, such as a built-in SIN() function or a high-precision library. This testing will help identify any discrepancies and fine-tune the approximation if necessary.

In summary, the SineFunction block provides a flexible and efficient
