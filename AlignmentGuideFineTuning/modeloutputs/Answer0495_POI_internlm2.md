**R-I-S-E:**

ðŸŸ¥ R (Role) â€“ Your Role

You are a PLC programmer or control engineer responsible for implementing mathematical computation blocks in IEC 61131-3 Structured Text, with a focus on supporting real-time matrix operations for control and automation tasks.

â¸»

ðŸŸ© I (Input) â€“ What Youâ€™re Given

You need to build a function block named MatrixMultiply4x4 that:
	â€¢	Accepts two 4Ã—4 matrices of type ARRAY[1..4, 1..4] OF REAL as inputs: MatrixA and MatrixB
	â€¢	Returns a resulting 4Ã—4 matrix, MatrixC, representing the matrix product
	â€¢	Follows IEC 61131-3 Structured Text syntax and best practices
	â€¢	Includes detailed inline comments explaining each stage of the algorithm
	â€¢	Handles loop-based computation efficiently within PLC memory and scan-time constraints
	â€¢	Should also discuss computational complexity and limitations of scaling to larger matrices

â¸»

ðŸŸ§ S (Steps) â€“ What You Need to Do
	1.	Define the function block interface with input/output variables:
 FUNCTION_BLOCK MatrixMultiply4x4
VAR_INPUT
    MatrixA, MatrixB : ARRAY[1..4, 1..4] OF REAL;
END_VAR
VAR_OUTPUT
    MatrixC : ARRAY[1..4, 1..4] OF REAL;
END_VAR
2.	Implement the matrix multiplication logic using three nested FOR loops:
FOR i := 1 TO 4 DO
    FOR j := 1 TO 4 DO
        MatrixC[i,j] := 0;
        FOR k := 1 TO 4 DO
            MatrixC[i,j] := MatrixC[i,j] + MatrixA[i,k] * MatrixB[k,j];
        END_FOR;
    END_FOR;
END_FOR;
	3.	Add inline comments to explain:
	â€¢	Row/column traversal logic
	â€¢	Accumulation of products for each matrix element
	â€¢	The use of fixed array indexing to ensure execution time predictability
	4.	Document performance considerations:
	â€¢	Computational complexity is O(nÂ³), which may not scale well on PLCs
	â€¢	Larger matrix support may require memory checks, iteration limits, or segmentation
	â€¢	Best suited for use cases like transformation matrices or motion control with fixed-size data

â¸»

ðŸŸ¦ E (Expectation) â€“ What Success Looks Like

You deliver a modular, reusable, and well-commented function block that:
	â€¢	Accurately computes the product of two 4Ã—4 matrices
	â€¢	Runs efficiently within PLC scan time limits
	â€¢	Is suitable for coordinate transformations, robotics, or motion planning
	â€¢	Can be extended to other matrix operations or adapted to support fixed NxN configurations
	â€¢	Is easy to understand and maintain by other developers working within IEC 61131-3 environments
