### Intent:
**Intent Summary:**  
Provide a concise introduction to IEC 61499 for engineers familiar with IEC 61131-3, highlighting its event-driven architecture, distributed capabilities, and key differences, along with recommended resources for further learning.  

*(Focus: Transition guide emphasizing practical differences and modern industrial applications.)*

### Prompt:
**Learning IEC 61499:**
Provide a concise introduction to the IEC 61499 programming language, emphasizing key concepts for someone already familiar with IEC 61131-3. Include a comparison of their fundamental differences in terms of architecture, execution models, and flexibility for distributed control systems. Additionally, compile a list of five key references for further reading on IEC 61499, highlighting its relevance in modern industrial applications.

**T-A-G:**

üü• T (Task) ‚Äì What You Need to Do

Introduce IEC 61499 to an audience that already understands IEC 61131-3. The focus should be on making the transition approachable by clearly explaining what‚Äôs new, what‚Äôs different, and why it matters for modern industrial systems.

‚∏ª
