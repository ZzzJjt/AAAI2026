🟥 R (Role) – Your Role

You are a PLC programmer or control systems engineer developing statistical function blocks in IEC 61131-3 Structured Text to support real-time probabilistic event analysis in industrial systems.

⸻

🟩 I (Input) – What You’re Given

You need to implement a function block that calculates the Poisson distribution probability, given:
	•	Lambda : REAL — the expected number of events (mean rate, λ)
	•	K : INT — the number of actual events observed

The output should be:
	•	Probability : REAL — the probability that K events occur given a rate Lambda
	•	Based on the Poisson probability mass function:
P(k; \lambda) = \frac{e^{-\lambda} \cdot \lambda^k}{k!}

You must also consider:
	•	Overflow and precision loss with large values of λ or k
	•	Executing efficiently within a real-time PLC scan cycle
	•	Proper domain checks (e.g., Lambda > 0, K ≥ 0)

⸻

🟧 S (Steps) – What You Need to Do
	1.	Define a function block named PoissonProbability with the following structure:
 FUNCTION_BLOCK PoissonProbability
VAR_INPUT
    Lambda : REAL;
    K : INT;
END_VAR
VAR_OUTPUT
    Probability : REAL;
END_VAR
	2.	Add logic to calculate factorial for K:
 VAR
    i : INT;
    Factorial : REAL := 1.0;
END_VAR

FOR i := 1 TO K DO
    Factorial := Factorial * i;
END_FOR;
	3.	Compute the Poisson probability:
 IF (Lambda > 0) AND (K >= 0) THEN
    Probability := EXP(-Lambda) * POW(Lambda, K) / Factorial;
ELSE
    Probability := 0.0;
END_IF;
	4.	Add inline comments explaining:
	•	Each step of the Poisson formula
	•	Why factorial is manually computed (no built-in factorial in ST)
	•	How floating-point math affects precision
	•	Consideration of upper limits for K to prevent overflow

⸻

🟦 E (Expectation) – What Success Looks Like

You deliver a compact and accurate function block that:
	•	Computes Poisson probabilities reliably for typical values of Lambda and K
	•	Avoids crashing or incorrect output for edge cases (e.g. negative inputs)
	•	Executes quickly enough for inclusion in real-time event monitoring applications
	•	Can be reused in use cases such as:
	•	Predicting machine failure rates
	•	Sensor event tracking over time intervals
	•	Process bottleneck analysis

🟥 P (Process) – What You Did

I created a self-contained function block in IEC 61131-3 Structured Text to compute the Poisson distribution for a given mean (λ) and input value (K). The function block is structured for clarity, with comments explaining the mathematical basis of the Poisson distribution and the computational steps involved. I addressed potential limitations, such as handling large values of λ, and discussed the practical applications of the Poisson distribution in industrial systems, particularly in the context of event-driven processes.

🟩 L (Learn) – What You Learned

I learned that the Poisson distribution is a statistical model used to describe the probability of a given number of events occurring in a fixed interval of time or space, given a known average rate of occurrence. I also learned that the Poisson distribution is commonly used in industrial systems to model event-driven processes, such as machine failures, sensor readings, or production bottlenecks. By implementing a function block to compute the Poisson distribution, I can now support real-time probabilistic event analysis in industrial control systems.

🟦 A (Action) – How You Did It

I created a function block named PoissonProbability in IEC 61131-3 Structured Text to calculate the Poisson distribution probability. I defined the input variables Lambda and K and the output variable Probability. I then added logic to calculate the factorial for K, which is manually computed due to the lack of a built-in factorial function in Structured Text. I computed the Poisson probability using the Poisson probability mass function, ensuring that the input values are within the valid range (Lambda > 0 and K ≥ 0). I added inline comments to explain each step of the Poisson formula, the need for manual factorial computation, and the impact of floating-point math on precision. I also discussed the importance of handling large values of λ and K to prevent overflow and ensure efficient execution within a real-time PLC scan cycle.

🟪 N (Next) – What You Can Do Differently Next Time

Next time, I would consider adding a check for the upper limit of K to prevent overflow and ensure the function block can handle large values of K. I would also explore the possibility of using a built-in factorial function in Structured Text, if available, to simplify the manual computation of factorials. Additionally, I would investigate the use
