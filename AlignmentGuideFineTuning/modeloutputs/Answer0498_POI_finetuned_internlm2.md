ðŸŸ© I (Input) â€“ What Youâ€™re Given

You need to implement a function block that calculates the Poisson distribution probability, given:

ðŸŸ¥ P (Process) â€“ What You Did

I created a self-contained function block in IEC 61131-3 Structured Text to compute the Poisson distribution for a given mean (Î») and input value (K). The function block is structured for clarity, with comments explaining the mathematical basis of the Poisson distribution and the computational steps involved. I addressed potential limitations, such as handling large values of Î», and discussed the practical applications of the Poisson distribution in industrial systems, particularly in the context of event-driven processes.

ðŸŸ© L (Learn) â€“ What You Learned

I learned that the Poisson distribution is a statistical model used to describe the probability of a given number of events occurring in a fixed interval of time or space, given a known average rate of occurrence. I also learned that the Poisson distribution is commonly used in industrial systems to model event-driven processes, such as machine failures, sensor readings, or production bottlenecks. By implementing a function block to compute the Poisson distribution, I can now support real-time probabilistic event analysis in industrial control systems.

ðŸŸ¦ A (Action) â€“ How You Did It

I created a function block named PoissonProbability in IEC 61131-3 Structured Text to calculate the Poisson distribution probability. I defined the input variables Lambda and K and the output variable Probability. I then added logic to calculate the factorial for K, which is manually computed due to the lack of a built-in factorial function in Structured Text. I computed the Poisson probability using the Poisson probability mass function, ensuring that the input values are within the valid range (Lambda > 0 and K â‰¥ 0). I added inline comments to explain each step of the Poisson formula, the need for manual factorial computation, and the impact of floating-point math on precision. I also discussed the importance of handling large values of Î» and K to prevent overflow and ensure efficient execution within a real-time PLC scan cycle.

ðŸŸª N (Next) â€“ What You Can Do Differently Next Time

Next time, I would consider adding a check for the upper limit of K to prevent overflow and ensure the function block can handle large values of K. I would also explore the possibility of using a built-in factorial function in Structured Text, if available, to simplify the manual computation of factorials. Additionally, I would investigate the use
