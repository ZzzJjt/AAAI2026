### Intent:
"Implement an MPC controller in Python to optimize infeed rates and maintain target tank levels in a chemical batch process with delayed batch releases and fluctuating demand."

### Prompt:
**Artificial Neural Network Control for Temperature Regulation in a Chemical Reactor Using Python:**

**Origin**

Develop Python code to implement an artificial neural network (ANN) for advanced process control of the temperature in a chemical reactor. The control system should leverage the predictive and adaptive capabilities of ANNs to manage the reactorâ€™s temperature, considering the nonlinear and time-varying nature of the reactorâ€™s dynamics. Train the ANN using historical process data to optimize temperature control, ensuring stability and efficiency under varying operational conditions.

Implement Python code to simulate the chemical reactorâ€™s temperature control dynamics and demonstrate how ANN-based control can outperform traditional methods in handling complex, nonlinear systems.

**R-T-F**

ðŸŸ¥ Rï¼ˆRoleï¼‰

Act as an AI-focused process control engineer.

ðŸŸ© Tï¼ˆTaskï¼‰

Create a neural network-based temperature control system for a nonlinear and time-varying chemical reactor. Develop Python code to train an artificial neural network (ANN) using historical process data, and simulate the reactorâ€™s temperature dynamics. Evaluate and compare the ANN controllerâ€™s performance against traditional PID controllers under varying conditions.

ðŸŸ§ Fï¼ˆFormatï¼‰

Show as a complete Python script with comments explaining each step, including data preprocessing, model training, control logic implementation, and simulation result visualization.
