### Intent:
"Implement a 2:1 ratio control system in Structured Text that dynamically adjusts Reactant B's flow rate to maintain the specified ratio with Reactant A, including input validation, error monitoring, and safety constraints."

### Prompt:
**Ratio Control Mixing:**

Develop a self-contained IEC 61131-3 Structured Text program (not a function block) to implement ratio control for mixing two reactants in a 2:1 ratio. The program should maintain the desired ratio between the two reactants by adjusting their flow rates dynamically, ensuring that for every two parts of reactant A, one part of reactant B is added.

Include logic to monitor the flow rates of both reactants and adjust one flow rate relative to the other to maintain the 2:1 ratio. The program should also handle any disturbances or variations in flow, adjusting the control signals to correct for deviations from the target ratio. Discuss the importance of ratio control in maintaining the desired chemical composition and the impact of disturbances on the mixing process.

ðŸŸ© T (Task) â€“ What You Need to Do

	1.	Continuously monitors the flow rates of reactant A and reactant B
	2.	Calculates the actual A:B ratio
	3.	Determines the setpoint for flow B to maintain the 2:1 ratio:
Flow_B_SP := Flow_A_PV / 2.0
	4.	Compares the actual ratio with the desired ratio and calculates an error margin
	5.	Optionally includes tolerance checking and flags when the system deviates from the required ratio
	6.	Prepares Flow_B_SP to be sent to a PID flow controller for reactant B

ðŸŸ¦ F (Format) â€“ Output Format

The output should be a clean IEC 61131-3 Structured Text code block like this:

VAR
    Flow_A_PV : REAL;                 // Measured flow rate of Reactant A
    Flow_B_PV : REAL;                 // Measured flow rate of Reactant B
    Flow_B_SP : REAL;                 // Setpoint for Reactant B (output)

    Ratio_Setpoint : REAL := 2.0;     // Desired ratio A:B = 2:1
    Actual_Ratio : REAL;
    Error : REAL;
    Tolerance : REAL := 0.05;         // Allowable deviation
END_VAR

// Calculate actual ratio (A:B)
IF Flow_B_PV > 0.0 THEN
    Actual_Ratio := Flow_A_PV / Flow_B_PV;
ELSE
    Actual_Ratio := 0.0;
END_IF

// Compute required flow setpoint for Reactant B
Flow_B_SP := Flow_A_PV / Ratio_Setpoint;

// Optional: Calculate ratio error for monitoring
Error := Actual_Ratio - Ratio_Setpoint;
IF ABS(Error) > Tolerance THEN
    // Raise alarm, activate flag, or correct with fallback logic
END_IF

**Input Validation:**

Implement input validation logic to ensure that the flow rates of both reactants are within acceptable ranges. This can be done by checking the flow rates against a minimum and maximum value, and raising an error or taking corrective action if the flow rates are outside of the acceptable range.

**Error Monitoring:**

Implement error monitoring logic to detect and handle any deviations from the desired ratio. This can be done by calculating the actual ratio between the two reactants and comparing it to the desired ratio. If the actual ratio deviates from the desired ratio by more than a specified tolerance, the program should take corrective action, such as adjusting the flow rates of the reactants or raising an alarm.

**Safety Constraints:**

Implement safety constraints to ensure that the flow rates of both reactants are within safe operating limits. This can be done by checking the flow rates against a minimum and maximum value, and taking corrective action if the flow rates are outside of the safe operating range. This can include reducing the flow rate of the reactant that is outside of the safe range, or shutting down the process entirely if the flow rates are too high or too low.

**Ratio Control:**

Implement ratio control logic to dynamically adjust the flow rates of the two reactants to maintain the desired ratio. This can be done by calculating the actual ratio between the two reactants and comparing it to the desired ratio. If the actual ratio deviates from the desired ratio, the program should adjust the flow rate of the reactant that is outside of the desired ratio to bring the actual ratio back to the desired ratio.

**Disturbance Handling:**

Implement disturbance handling logic to account for any disturbances or variations in the flow rates of the two reactants. This can be done by monitoring the flow rates of the two reactants and adjusting the flow rates of the reactants to account for any disturbances or variations. This can include increasing or decreasing the flow rate of the reactant that is outside of the desired ratio to bring the actual ratio back to the desired ratio.

**Tolerance Checking:**

Implement tolerance checking logic to ensure that the actual ratio between the two reactants is within a specified tolerance of the desired ratio. This can be done by calculating the actual ratio between the two reactants and comparing it to the desired ratio. If the actual ratio deviates from the desired ratio by more than a specified tolerance, the program should take corrective action, such as adjusting the flow rates of the reactants or raising an alarm.

**PID Control:**
