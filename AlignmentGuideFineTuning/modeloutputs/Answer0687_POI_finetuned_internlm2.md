### Intent:
**Intent Summary:**  
Create a text-based P&ID for a power plant's steam-water cycle, detailing equipment, instrumentation, control loops, and tagged flow paths to support design, automation, and documentation in a non-graphical format.  

*(Focused on structured textual representation of process flow and control logic for engineering use cases.)*

### Prompt:
**P-ID Steam Water Cycle:**

Create a P&I diagram in textual notation for a steam water cycle in a power plant. Include equipment, instrumentation, piping, and control loops. Provide concrete tag names.


**R-I-S-E:**

ðŸŸ¥ R (Role) â€“ Define Your Role

Act as a process control engineer responsible for documenting the steam-water cycle of a power plant using text-based P&ID notation for use in early design, instrumentation planning, or control logic development.

â¸»

ðŸŸ© I (Input) â€“ Information Provided

You are to create a textual Piping and Instrumentation Diagram (P&ID) that covers the full steam-water cycle, including:
	â€¢	Major equipment (e.g., boiler, steam drum, feedwater pump, condenser)
	â€¢	Associated instrumentation (e.g., transmitters, controllers, control valves)
	â€¢	Piping flow direction using arrows (-->)
	â€¢	Concrete tag names for all components (e.g., FT101, LT102, FCV103)

The output should mirror the clarity of a traditional P&ID but in structured text form, supporting use cases where graphics are unavailable or impractical.

ðŸŸ§ S (Steps) â€“ Steps to Perform
	1.	List key components of the steam-water cycle in operational order:
	â€¢	Feedwater Pump â†’ Boiler â†’ Steam Drum â†’ Turbine â†’ Condenser â†’ Back to Feed
	2.	For each equipment item, identify the associated instrumentation and control loops, e.g.:
	â€¢	FT101 (Flow Transmitter), FIC101 (Flow Controller), FCV101 (Flow Control Valve)
	3.	Connect elements using text-based flow notation, e.g.:

 P01 --> FT101 --> FIC101 --> FCV101 --> B01

 4.	Ensure each control loop includes a transmitter, controller, and actuator, and assign clear tag numbers.
	5.	Organize the diagram in logical blocks (e.g., Feedwater System, Boiler Section, Condensate Return) for readability.

â¸»

ðŸŸ¦ E (Expectation) â€“ Expected Outcome

Deliver a text-based P&ID that provides a complete, readable map of the steam-water cycle, including all control logic and signal pathways. It should:
	â€¢	Support cross-functional collaboration (engineering, automation, commissioning)
	â€¢	Serve as input for PLC/DCS programming
	â€¢	Ensure traceability through clearly labeled tags and flow paths
	â€¢	Be portable and editable in plain-text tools and version control systems

ðŸŸ¥ A (Action) â€“ What You Need to Do

Create a text-based P&ID for a steam-water cycle in a power plant, including all major equipment, instrumentation, and control loops. Use clear tag names and flow notation to document the process in a structured, readable format.

**P&ID Steam Water Cycle:**

Feedwater Pump (P01) --> Flow Transmitter (FT101) --> Flow Controller (FIC101) --> Flow Control Valve (FCV101) --> Boiler (B01) --> Steam Drum (S01) --> Turbine (T01) --> Condenser (C01) --> Back to Feedwater Pump (P01)

**Tag List:**

P01: Feedwater Pump
FT101: Flow Transmitter
FIC101: Flow Controller
FCV101: Flow Control Valve
B01: Boiler
S01: Steam Drum
T01: Turbine
C01: Condenser

**Control Loops:**

FT101 --> FIC101 --> FCV101: Flow Control Loop
B01 --> S01: Level Control Loop
T01 --> C01: Pressure Control Loop

**P&ID Explanation:**

The steam-water cycle in a power plant is a critical process that requires precise control of flow, pressure, and temperature. This text-based P&ID provides a clear, structured representation of the cycle, including all major components and control loops. The tag list ensures traceability and readability, while the flow notation clearly defines the direction of fluid flow. This format is ideal for use in early design, instrumentation planning, and control logic development, as it can be easily shared and edited in plain-text tools and version control systems.
