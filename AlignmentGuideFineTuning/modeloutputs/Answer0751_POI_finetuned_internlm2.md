### Intent:
**Intent Summary:**  
Develop a self-contained IEC 61131-3 Structured Text program for cascade control of a heat exchanger, where an outer loop adjusts temperature setpoints and an inner loop regulates heating medium flow, using proportional control with example tuning values (e.g., `Kp_Outer := 1.0`), prioritizing fast inner-loop response and modular code structure.  

*(Key focus: Cascade control, temperature/flow loops, real-time execution, and readability.)*

### Prompt:
**Cascade Control Heat Exchanger:**

Develop a self-contained IEC 61131-3 Structured Text program (not a function block) to implement cascade control for regulating the temperature in a heat exchanger. The outer loop should control the temperature setpoint based on the process requirements, while the inner loop controls the flow rate of the heating medium to adjust the temperature dynamically.

The program should manage the interaction between the primary and secondary control loops, ensuring that the inner loop responds quickly to disturbances, while the outer loop provides overall temperature stability. Include typical parameter values for temperature control and flow adjustments, and discuss the advantages of using cascade control in heat exchanger systems, particularly in improving response times and maintaining stable temperature control under varying load conditions.

**R-T-F:**

ðŸŸ¥ R (Role) â€“ Your Role

ðŸŸ© T (Task) â€“ What You Need to Do

Develop a self-contained Structured Text program (not a function block) that implements:
	1.	Cascade Control Structure:
	â€¢	An outer loop to maintain the outlet temperature at a desired setpoint (Temp_SP) by adjusting the setpoint of the inner loop.
	â€¢	An inner loop to control the flow rate of the heating medium based on feedback (Flow_PV) to quickly respond to disturbances.
	2.	Control Logic:
	â€¢	Use proportional control (you may later extend to PID).
	â€¢	Example values:
	â€¢	Temp_SP := 85.0
	â€¢	Kp_Outer := 1.0, Kp_Inner := 2.0
	3.	Real-time Execution:
	â€¢	Ensure the inner loop runs faster and stabilizes flow before the outer loop updates the temperature target.
	4.	Code Structure:
	â€¢	Modular, readable, and expandable
	â€¢	Include comments explaining each step for maintainability

ðŸŸ§ F (Format) â€“ Expected Output

Your output should be a clean IEC 61131-3 Structured Text (ST) code block such as:

VAR
    // Outer loop: temperature control
    Temp_SP : REAL := 85.0;
    Temp_PV : REAL;
    Temp_Error : REAL;
    Flow_SP : REAL;

    // Inner loop: flow control
    Flow_PV : REAL;
    Flow_Error : REAL;
    Flow_Output : REAL;

    // Controller tuning parameters
    Kp_Outer : REAL := 1.0;
    Kp_Inner : REAL := 2.0;
END_VAR

// Outer loop logic
Temp_Error := Temp_SP - Temp_PV;
Flow_SP := Kp_Outer * Temp_Error;

// Inner loop logic
Flow_Error := Flow_SP - Flow_PV;
Flow_Output := Kp_Inner * Flow_Error;

// Flow_Output is used to drive the control valve

This program should:
	â€¢	Keep temperature stable by adjusting flow indirectly
	â€¢	React quickly to disturbances via the inner loop
	â€¢	Serve as a template for future extensions like PID or alarm handling

**D-I-S-C-U-S-S:**

ðŸŸ¥ D (Discussion) â€“ Whatâ€™s Happening?

Cascade control is a widely used strategy in process control to achieve fast response times and stable temperature regulation. In a heat exchanger, the outer loop adjusts the temperature setpoint, while the inner loop controls the flow rate of the heating medium to maintain the desired temperature. This separation of control allows the inner loop to respond quickly to disturbances, while the outer loop provides overall temperature stability.

Cascade control is important in heat exchanger systems because it allows for fast response times and stable temperature regulation under varying load conditions. By separating the control of temperature and flow, the inner loop can quickly adjust the flow rate to maintain the desired temperature, while the outer loop provides overall stability. This separation also helps to reduce the impact of
