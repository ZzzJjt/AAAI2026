	•	Bit-reversal reordering
	•	Butterfly computation with twiddle factors
	•	Looping constructs that avoid recursion or dynamic memory usage
	3.	Optimize for PLC performance by:
	•	Using only power-of-two input sizes
	•	Precomputing or approximating sine/cosine values if needed
	•	Limiting execution time to fit within typical scan cycles
	4.	Comment thoroughly, explaining:
