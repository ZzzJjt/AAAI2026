ðŸŸ¥ Rï¼ˆRoleï¼‰

Act as a control systems engineer developing Python-based model predictive control (MPC) solutions for energy systems in thermal power plants.

ðŸŸ© Iï¼ˆInputï¼‰

You are tasked with optimizing the operation of a turbine in a thermal power plant. The system must handle complex thermal dynamics, respond to varying electrical load demands, and operate within strict physical and efficiency constraints, all while being robust to external disturbances.

ðŸŸ§ Sï¼ˆStepsï¼‰
	1.	Model the turbineâ€™s thermal and dynamic behavior in Python, including relevant constraints such as maximum pressure, temperature, and ramp rates.
	2.	Design and implement a model predictive control (MPC) algorithm that forecasts system behavior and adjusts control inputs to meet future targets.
