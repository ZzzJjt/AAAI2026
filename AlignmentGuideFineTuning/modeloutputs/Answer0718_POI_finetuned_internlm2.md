### Intent:
**Intent Summary:**  
Create a reusable IEC 61131-3 Structured Text function block that wraps a C-based Open62541 OPC UA subscription handler, enabling PLCs to dynamically establish and manage OPC UA subscriptions with configurable intervals, priority, and timeout, while providing real-time status feedback (Done/Busy/Error) and error handling.  

*(Focus: C-to-ST integration for OPC UA subscriptions with cyclic execution and adjustable parameters.)*

### Prompt:
**OPC UA Subscription Creation Using Open62541 and IEC 61131-3 Structured Text:**

Develop a C function block for OPC UA subscription creation using the Open62541 library, which will be wrapped in IEC 61131-3 structured text code. The function block receives a Connection Handle as a DWORD and has the following inputs: an executed flag (BOOL), a priority (BYTE), and a timeout (TIME). As outputs, it provides three status flags (Done, Busy, Error) along with two DWORD outputs (ErrorID, SubscriptionHdl). The function block also includes an IN/OUT variable PublishingInterval (type TIME), which allows dynamic adjustment of the subscription interval.

In your explanation, describe how this C function block can be wrapped inside IEC 61131-3 structured text code, highlighting the integration steps and providing an example of how to call the function block within an ST program. Discuss error handling, subscription management, and real-time communication with OPC UA servers.

ðŸŸ© T (Task) â€“ What You Need to Do

Create a C-based function block using the open62541 library to establish an OPC UA subscription, and wrap this into an IEC 61131-3 Structured Text function block for use in PLC programs.

The ST function block should include the following interface:

Inputs:
	â€¢	Execute (BOOL): Triggers the subscription creation
	â€¢	ConnectionHdl (DWORD): OPC UA session handle
	â€¢	Priority (BYTE): Subscription priority level
	â€¢	Timeout (TIME): Max wait duration for the operation
	â€¢	PublishingInterval (IN/OUT, TIME): The data update interval, dynamically adjustable

Outputs:
	â€¢	Done (BOOL): Indicates successful subscription creation
	â€¢	Busy (BOOL): TRUE while the operation is in progress
	â€¢	Error (BOOL): Set if an error occurs
	â€¢	ErrorID (DWORD): Provides a specific error code
	â€¢	SubscriptionHdl (DWORD): The handle of the newly created subscription

Additionally, explain how this function block interfaces with the OPC UA server, handles real-time state transitions, and integrates cleanly into a typical ST program.

ðŸŸ¥ C (Context) â€“ Background

OPC UA (Open Platform Communications Unified Architecture) is a secure, open, and platform-independent communication protocol for industrial automation. It enables real-time data exchange between devices, systems, and applications, supporting a wide range of industrial communication needs.

C-based function blocks are often used in industrial control systems to encapsulate reusable logic, such as OPC UA subscription creation. Wrapping these C functions in IEC 61131-3 Structured Text (ST) allows for seamless integration into PLC programming, enabling real-time control and monitoring of OPC UA subscriptions.

ðŸŸ© A (Action) â€“ What You Should Do

Create a C function block that establishes an OPC UA subscription using the open62541 library. This function block should accept parameters for the connection handle, priority, timeout, and publishing interval. It should return a subscription handle and status flags indicating whether the subscription was successfully created or if an error occurred.

Next, wrap this C function block in an IEC 61131-3 Structured Text function block, ensuring that all input and output variables are properly mapped. Document the function block, including its purpose, inputs, outputs, and any necessary error handling.

Finally, provide an example of how this function block can be used in a PLC program, demonstrating how to instantiate and execute the function block in a cyclic task.
