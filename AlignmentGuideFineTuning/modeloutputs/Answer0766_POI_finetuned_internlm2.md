### Intent:
**Intent Summary:**  
Create a state machine-based PLC program to control a polyethylene batch process, managing sequential phases (raw material preparation, reaction, cooling, discharge) with safety checks, timer logic, and fault handling.  

**Key Focus:**  
- State transitions (Idle â†’ RawMatPrep â†’ Reaction â†’ Cooling â†’ Discharge)  
- Valve control (ethylene/catalyst/discharge)  
- Parameter validation and fault monitoring  
- Time-based phase progression using `TON` timers

### Prompt:
**List Mathematical Function Blocks:**
