### Intent:
The task involves creating a detailed control narrative for an ammonium nitrate reactor, specifying process parameters, instrumentation, control loops, operational sequences, and safety interlocks to ensure safe and efficient continuous operation.  

**Intent Summary:**  
*Generate a structured control system configuration for an ammonium nitrate reactor, including process logic, instrumentation tags, PID loops, sequenced operations (startup/steady-state/shutdown), and safety interlocks, formatted for automation system implementation.*

### Prompt:
**P-ID Steam Water Cycle:**

Create a P&I diagram in textual notation for a steam water cycle in a power plant. Include equipment, instrumentation, piping, and control loops. Provide concrete tag names.


**R-T-F:**

ðŸŸ¥ R (Role) â€“ Define Your Role

Act as a process engineer or control system designer responsible for creating a text-based Piping and Instrumentation Diagram (P&ID) for a steam-water cycle in a power plant.

â¸»

ðŸŸ© T (Task) â€“ Define the Objective

Develop a P&ID in textual notation that clearly describes the steam-water cycle, including:
	â€¢	All major equipment (e.g., boiler, feedwater pump, steam drum, condenser)
	â€¢	Instrumentation (e.g., transmitters, controllers, control valves)
	â€¢	Piping and flow paths, shown using text arrows (-->)
	â€¢	Complete control loops with realistic and consistent tag names (e.g., FT101, FCV102, LT103)

The diagram should reflect actual process logic and signal relationships, structured clearly in text format.

â¸»

ðŸŸ§ F (Format) â€“ Specify the Output Format

Provide the output as a plain-text diagram, formatted for readability and easy integration into documentation or code repositories. Use a consistent layout to show:
	â€¢	Equipment blocks connected by signal and flow arrows
	â€¢	Control loops such as:

 P01 --> FT101 --> FIC101 --> FCV101 --> Boiler B01

 	â€¢	Instrument tags in ISA style and logical grouping by process section (e.g., feedwater, boiler, condensate return)
