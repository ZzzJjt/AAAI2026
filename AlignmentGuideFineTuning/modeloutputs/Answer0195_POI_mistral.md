### Intent:
**Intent Summary:**  
Generate a structured I/O list table with 30 entries for a steel rolling mill, including signal names, I/O types, tagnumbers, analog/digital classification, engineering units, ranges, setpoints, and P&ID references to standardize control system documentation and ensure integration accuracy.

### Prompt:
**IO List Rolling Mill:**

Create an I/O list as a table with 30 lines for a rolling mill in a steel production plant. Have as columns signal name, input/output, signal tagnumber, analog/digital, engineering unit, ranges, setpoint, and P&ID reference.

**B-A-B:**

ðŸŸ¥ B (Before) â€“ The Problem or Challenge

Designing and integrating control systems for a rolling mill in a steel production plant requires a detailed and standardized I/O list. Without a well-organized table capturing key signal characteristics, such as I/O type, ranges, and engineering units, engineers risk miswiring, mismatches in PLC logic, and inconsistent documentation across instrumentation, control panels, and HMI systems.

â¸»

ðŸŸ© A (After) â€“ The Desired Outcome

Create a structured I/O list table with 30 entries specific to a rolling mill system. The table should include the following columns for each signal:
	â€¢	Signal Name
	â€¢	Input/Output
	â€¢	Signal Tagnumber
	â€¢	Analog/Digital
	â€¢	Engineering Unit
	â€¢	Range
	â€¢	Setpoint
	â€¢	P&ID Reference

This list should serve as a foundation for instrumentation wiring, PLC configuration, and control narrative alignment, ensuring that all process signals are properly identified and described.

ðŸŸ§ B (Bridge) â€“ How to Get There
	1.	Identify typical signals in a rolling mill (e.g., entry tension, roll force, speed feedback, motor current, cooling valve command).
	2.	For each of the 30 entries, define:
	â€¢	Whether the signal is an input (sensor) or output (actuator)
	â€¢	Its analog/digital type
	â€¢	Units such as bar, Â°C, m/min, kN
	â€¢	Expected range and setpoint values
	â€¢	Reference back to a P&ID drawing for traceability
	3.	Present the data in a clean, consistent tabular format, suitable for use in Excel, a PDF datasheet, or PLC documentation.

Here's a sample I/O list for a rolling mill with 30 entries:

| Signal Name | Input/Output | Signal Tagnumber | Analog/Digital | Engineering Unit | Range | Setpoint | P&ID Reference |
|-------------|-------------|------------------|----------------|------------------|-------|----------|--------------|
| Entry Tension | Input | TENSION_ENTRY_1 | Analog | bar | 0-100 | 50 | P&ID-001 |
| Roll Force | Input | FORCE_ROLL_1 | Analog | kN | 0-1000 | 500 | P&ID-002 |
| Speed Feedback | Input | SPEED_FEEDBACK_1 | Analog | m/min | 0-100 | 50 | P&ID-003 |
| Motor Current | Input | CURRENT_MOTOR_1 | Analog | A | 0-100 | 50 | P&ID-004 |
| Cooling Valve Command | Output | VALVE_COOLING_1 | Digital | % | 0-100 | 50 | P&ID-005 |
| ... | ... | ... | ... | ... | ... | ... | ... |
| ... | ... | ... | ... | ... | ... | ... | ... |
| ... | ... | ... | ... | ... | ... | ... | ... |

This table can be easily expanded to include more signals as needed, and it provides a clear and consistent format for control system documentation.
