### Intent:
**Intent Summary:**  
Generate a structured text-based Process Flow Diagram (PFD) for penicillin fermentation, detailing unit operations, material flows, instrumentation, and control logic to replace graphical diagrams in early-stage design or plain-text collaboration.  

*(Focus: Textual PFD with process stages, instrumentation tags, and control strategy for fermentation automation.)*

### Prompt:
**PFD Penicillin Fermentation:**

Create a Process Flow Diagram (PFD) in textual notation for a fermentation process to produce penicillin. Include instrumentation and control philosophy.

**B-A-B:**

🟥 B (Before) – The Problem or Challenge

In designing or documenting a penicillin fermentation process, engineers often rely on graphical Process Flow Diagrams (PFDs) to communicate material flow, unit operations, and instrumentation. However, in early-stage design, collaborative environments, or plain-text interfaces, graphical tools may not be available, making it difficult to share or version-control process documentation. Without a structured text-based PFD, the clarity of system layout, control strategy, and instrument placement can be lost.

⸻

🟩 A (After) – The Desired Outcome

Create a text-based Process Flow Diagram (PFD) for a penicillin fermentation process that clearly outlines:
	•	Major unit operations (e.g., media preparation, sterilization, fermentation, filtration, downstream recovery)
	•	Flow direction of materials between these stages
	•	Key instrumentation (e.g., temperature sensors, pH probes, level transmitters)
	•	A high-level control philosophy describing how parameters like temperature, agitation, and pH are maintained automatically during fermentation

This textual PFD should be easy to read, logically sequenced, and usable in documentation or collaboration where graphical diagrams are impractical.

⸻

🟧 B (Bridge) – How to Get There
	1.	List the major process stages in order of operation (e.g., Water Tank → Nutrient Mix → Sterilizer → Fermenter → Separator → Product Tank).
	2.	Use arrows (-->) to represent material flow.
	3.	Annotate each unit with instrumentation tags (e.g., TT101 for temperature transmitter, pH100 for pH sensor, FIC102 for flow control).
	4.	Include a control strategy note for each step (e.g., “Fermenter temperature controlled via jacket and PID loop TT201 → TIC201 → TC201”).
	5.	Format the result in clean, indented text blocks that clearly show process structure, equipment, and signal/control flow.
