**B-A-B:**

🟥 B (Before) – The Challenge

In industrial automation, understanding variability in sensor data or process measurements is key to diagnostics, control performance, and quality assurance. However, many PLC platforms lack native statistical functions, and computing statistics like mean and standard deviation efficiently—especially for larger datasets—can be difficult due to precision limits, overflow risks, and real-time scan-time constraints.

🟩 A (After) – The Ideal Outcome

Develop a self-contained function block in IEC 61131-3 Structured Text named MeanStdDevCalculator that:
	•	Accepts a fixed-size input array of 100 integers: InputArray : ARRAY[1..100] OF INT
	•	Computes and outputs:
	•	Mean : REAL – the arithmetic average of the array values
	•	StdDev : REAL – the standard deviation based on the sample formula
	•	Follows this logic:
	1.	Sum all values and divide by 100 to get the mean
	2.	Subtract the mean from each value, square the result, and sum all squared differences
	3.	Divide the sum of squares by (100 - 1), then take the square root for standard deviation
	•	Includes detailed inline comments for each computation step
	•	Uses internal REAL variables to prevent integer overflow during accumulation and division
	•	Is modular and reusable for real-time control scenarios such as:
	•	Sensor noise filtering
	•	Statistical quality control
	•	Monitoring variance in cycle times
