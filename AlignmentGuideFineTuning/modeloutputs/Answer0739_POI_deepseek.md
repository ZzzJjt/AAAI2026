### Intent:
**Intent Summary:**  
Create a reusable IEC 61131-3 function block to compute the sine of an angle (in radians) using either a native `SIN()` function or a Taylor series approximation (7th-order), with documentation on precision, limitations, and real-time PLC optimization.  

*(Focus: Modular sine calculation for industrial motion/signal applications where native support may be lacking.)*

### Prompt:
**Sine Function**

Develop a self-contained function block in IEC 61131-3 Structured Text to compute the sine of a given angle in radians.

ðŸŸ© T (Task) â€“ What You Need to Do

Create a self-contained function block named SineFunction that:
	â€¢	Computes the sine of a given angle expressed in radians
	â€¢	Uses the built-in SIN() function if available
	â€¢	Alternatively, approximates sine using a Taylor series expansion up to the 7th power term for environments without native support
	â€¢	Accepts one input:
	â€¢	AngleRad : REAL â€” the angle in radians
	â€¢	Returns one output:
	â€¢	SineValue : REAL â€” the computed sine value
	â€¢	Is fully documented with inline comments explaining:
	â€¢	The mathematical basis for the sine function
	â€¢	Why radians (not degrees) are used
	â€¢	The range, convergence characteristics, and error limitations of the Taylor series approximation
	â€¢	Is optimized for real-time execution on PLCs, using no recursion and fixed iteration logic

ðŸŸ§ F (Format) â€“ Expected Output

You should produce a readable, efficient, and reusable IEC 61131-3 Structured Text function block like:

FUNCTION_BLOCK SineFunction
VAR_INPUT
    AngleRad : REAL;
END_VAR
VAR_OUTPUT
    SineValue : REAL;
END_VAR
VAR
    x, x2, x3, x5, x7 : REAL;
END_VAR

// Use Taylor Series approximation if SIN() is unavailable
x := AngleRad;
x2 := x * x;
x3 := x2 * x;
x5 := x3 * x2;
x7 := x5 * x2;
SineValue := x - (x3 / 6.0) + (x5 / 120.0) - (x7 / 5040.0);

// Note: For large inputs, consider normalizing to -PI..PI

This function block is suitable for real-time control tasks where trigonometric functions are required but platform support is limited. Itâ€™s a reliable and maintainable tool for implementing smooth motion curves, phase-based timing, or signal shaping directly within PLC logic.

This function block is suitable for real-time control tasks where trigonometric functions are required but platform support is limited. Itâ€™s a reliable and maintainable tool for implementing smooth motion curves, phase-based timing, or signal shaping directly within PLC logic.

**Limitations:**

1. The Taylor series approximation may not converge for large input values, leading to inaccuracies.
2. The function block may consume more CPU resources in real-time applications due to the iterative nature of the Taylor series approximation.
3. The function block may not be suitable for applications requiring high precision, as the Taylor series approximation inherently has a finite number of terms.

**Real-Time Optimization:**

1. Use a fixed-point data type for the input and output variables to reduce the precision error and improve the performance.
2. Optimize the Taylor series approximation by limiting the number of iterations to a reasonable value.
3. Use a loop-based structure instead of recursion to minimize the overhead of function calls.
4. Implement the function block in a way that minimizes the CPU usage during execution.

**Conclusion:**

The SineFunction function block provides a flexible and efficient solution for real-time PLC applications lacking native support for trigonometric functions. By using either the built-in SIN() function or a Taylor series approximation, the function block can compute the sine of an angle in radians with acceptable precision and performance. However, it's important to consider the limitations and potential drawbacks when using this function block in specific applications.
