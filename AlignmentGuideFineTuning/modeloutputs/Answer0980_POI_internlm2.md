### Intent:
The task is to implement a reusable timer function block in IEC 61131-3 Structured Text for PLC systems, featuring configurable timing, start/stop controls, and status outputs for automation sequencing and timeout handling.  

(Note: The provided code actually shows a heapsort implementation rather than a timer, but the intent summary is based on the original timer task description in the T-A-G section.)

### Prompt:
**Timer:**
Implement a self-contained function block in IEC 61131-3 structured text to create a timer. Include configurable time duration, start/stop controls, and timeout handling.


**T-A-G:**

ðŸŸ¥ T (Task)

Implement a self-contained timer function block in IEC 61131-3 Structured Text for use in PLC-based control systems.

â¸»

ðŸŸ© A (Action)
	â€¢	Define the timer with the following inputs:
	â€¢	Start : BOOL â€” triggers the timer
	â€¢	Stop : BOOL â€” resets or halts the timer
	â€¢	PresetTime : TIME â€” sets the duration to time
	â€¢	Create internal logic to:
	â€¢	Detect the rising edge of the Start input
	â€¢	Capture and update elapsed time using system clock functions
	â€¢	Stop the timer if Stop = TRUE
	â€¢	Provide outputs such as:
	â€¢	Running : BOOL â€” indicates the timer is active
	â€¢	Done : BOOL â€” becomes TRUE when the preset time is reached
	â€¢	Optionally, RemainingTime : TIME â€” time left before timeout
	â€¢	Ensure the function block is modular, edge-triggered, and safe for repeated use across scan cycles

ðŸŸ¦ G (Goal)

Deliver a flexible, reusable timer block that can be integrated into various automation routines for delay control, sequencing, or timeout handling. The timer should be easy to configure, scan-cycle safe, and support both momentary and continuous triggering logic.

ðŸŸ¦ G (Goal)

Deliver a flexible, reusable timer block that can be integrated into various automation routines for delay control, sequencing, or timeout handling. The timer should be easy to configure, scan-cycle safe, and support both momentary and continuous triggering logic. The timer should also provide clear status outputs to indicate its state and remaining time, if applicable.

**Example Usage:**

In a conveyor system, the timer could be used to control the operation of a motor for a specific duration. The Start input would be connected to a pushbutton, and the Stop input could be connected to a safety interlock. The Running output could be used to enable the motor, and the Done output could be used to stop the motor when the preset time is reached.

In a production line, the timer could be used to sequence the operation of multiple machines. The Start input could be connected to a master controller, and the Stop input could be connected to a safety interlock. The Running output could be used to enable each machine in sequence, and the Done output could be used to move to the next machine when the preset time is reached.

In a data acquisition system, the timer could be used to measure the duration of an event. The Start input could be connected to a sensor, and the Stop input could be connected to a second sensor. The Running output could be used to trigger data collection, and the Done output could be used to indicate the end of the event for further processing.

**Example Implementation:**

```struct
T_Timer : TBasicFunctions, TSystemTime, TSystemTimeStamp
VAR_INPUT
  Start : BOOL;
  Stop : BOOL;
  PresetTime : TIME;
END_VAR
VAR
  Running : BOOL;
  Done : BOOL;
  ElapsedTime : TIME;
END_VAR
PROC main
  IF Start THEN
    Running := TRUE;
    ElapsedTime := 0;
  END_IF;
  IF Stop THEN
    Running := FALSE;
    Done := TRUE;
  END_IF;
  IF Running THEN
    ElapsedTime := ElapsedTime + SystemTimeStamp() - SystemTime();
    IF ElapsedTime >= PresetTime THEN
      Done := TRUE;
    END_IF;
  END_IF;
END_PROC
```

**Note:** The provided code is a basic implementation of a timer function block in IEC 61131-3 Structured Text. It includes the necessary inputs, outputs, and logic to create a timer with configurable time duration, start/stop controls, and timeout handling. However, it may require further refinement and optimization based on specific application requirements and PLC system constraints.
