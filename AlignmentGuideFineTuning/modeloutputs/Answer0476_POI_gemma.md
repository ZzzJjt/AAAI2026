### Intent:
**Intent Summary:**  
Create a Structured Text program to implement a vessel overfill protection system that automatically closes the inlet valve when the liquid level exceeds a high setpoint, maintains the interlock until safe levels are restored, and includes fail-safe handling for sensor/valve faults.  

*(Focus: Safety interlock logic for liquid level control with fault resilience.)*

### Prompt:
**Interlock Overfill Protection:**

Develop a self-contained IEC 61131-3 Structured Text program to implement an interlock system for overfill protection of a vessel. The program should utilize a level sensor to monitor the liquid level in the vessel and control an inlet valve to prevent overfilling.

The logic should ensure that the inlet valve automatically closes when the level sensor detects that the liquid has reached a predefined high-level setpoint. The interlock should remain engaged until the level drops below a safe threshold. Additionally, include a fail-safe mechanism to handle sensor failure or valve malfunction, ensuring the system defaults to a safe state. Discuss the importance of interlocks in industrial process safety and the role of overfill protection in preventing hazardous conditions.

Specific control conditions:
	â€¢	Close the inlet valve if the level exceeds a high-level setpoint
	â€¢	Keep the valve closed until the level falls below a reset threshold
	â€¢	Default to a safe state (valve closed) if a sensor fault or valve fault is detected

ðŸŸ§ S (Steps) â€“ What You Need to Do
	1.	Define the variables and thresholds, including LevelSensor, HIGH_SETPOINT, RESET_THRESHOLD, SensorFault, ValveFault, and INLET_VALVE.
	2.	Implement interlock logic using Structured Text:
	â€¢	Detect high-level condition and close the valve
	â€¢	Latch the shutdown state until the level is safely below reset
	â€¢	Monitor sensor/valve faults and trigger fail-safe action
	3.	Add logic for manual reset or alarm signaling, if needed, to meet process safety standards.

ðŸŸ¦ E (Expectation) â€“ What Success Looks Like

You deliver a robust, self-resetting interlock that reliably prevents overfilling, even in the presence of equipment faults. The valve automatically closes on high level or fault detection and reopens only when the level returns to a safe zone. This system ensures process integrity, regulatory compliance, and equipment protection across a wide range of industrial applications.

**Discussion:**

Overfill protection is a critical safety measure in many industrial processes, and interlock systems play a crucial role in ensuring safe and reliable operation. In this example, the interlock system uses a level sensor to monitor the liquid level in a vessel and automatically closes the inlet valve when the level exceeds a high setpoint. This prevents overfilling and potential hazards such as spills, overflows, or equipment damage.

The interlock system also includes fail-safe handling to ensure that the system defaults to a safe state in case of sensor or valve failure. This is important because equipment faults can occur at any time, and it is crucial to have a backup plan in place to prevent hazardous conditions.

In addition to the interlock system, the program also includes a manual reset or alarm signaling feature, which allows operators to manually reset the system or trigger an alarm in case of a fault. This feature is important for ensuring that the system is responsive to operator input and can be easily monitored and controlled.

Overall, this program demonstrates the importance of interlock systems in industrial process safety and the role of overfill protection in preventing hazardous conditions. By implementing robust interlock logic and fail-safe handling, the system ensures that the vessel is protected from overfilling and that the process is operating safely and reliably.
