### Intent:
The task involves implementing a Model Predictive Control (MPC) system for a wind farm with energy storage to optimize turbine speed, power output, and battery state-of-charge while handling disturbances like wind gusts and demand surges.

### Prompt:
**Artificial Neural Network Control for Temperature Regulation in a Chemical Reactor Using Python:**

**Origin**

Develop Python code to implement an artificial neural network (ANN) for advanced process control of the temperature in a chemical reactor. The control system should leverage the predictive and adaptive capabilities of ANNs to manage the reactorâ€™s temperature, considering the nonlinear and time-varying nature of the reactorâ€™s dynamics. Train the ANN using historical process data to optimize temperature control, ensuring stability and efficiency under varying operational conditions.

Implement Python code to simulate the chemical reactorâ€™s temperature control dynamics and demonstrate how ANN-based control can outperform traditional methods in handling complex, nonlinear systems.

**R-I-S-E**

ðŸŸ¥ Rï¼ˆRoleï¼‰

Act as a process control engineer specializing in AI-driven control systems for chemical reactors.

ðŸŸ© Iï¼ˆInputï¼‰

You are given a dataset containing historical temperature control data from a chemical reactor with known nonlinear and time-varying behavior. The reactorâ€™s traditional PID control performance under different operating scenarios is also available for comparison.

ðŸŸ§ Sï¼ˆStepsï¼‰
	1.	Develop Python code to build an artificial neural network (ANN) model trained on the historical dataset.
	2.	Implement an ANN-based controller for temperature regulation, leveraging its predictive and adaptive capabilities.
	3.	Simulate the chemical reactorâ€™s temperature control dynamics using both ANN and traditional PID methods.
	4.	Compare and analyze the performance of the ANN controller against the PID controller under various dynamic conditions.

ðŸŸ¦ Eï¼ˆExpectationï¼‰

Demonstrate that the ANN-based controller offers improved temperature stability, quicker response to disturbances, and better handling of nonlinearities compared to the traditional PID controller, thereby proving its effectiveness in advanced process control applications.
