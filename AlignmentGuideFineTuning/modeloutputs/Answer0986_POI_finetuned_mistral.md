### Control Narrative for Steam Generator Feedwater Control

#### 1. Purpose

This control narrative describes the operation of the feedwater control system for the steam generator in a power plant. The system ensures that the correct amount of feedwater is supplied to the boiler to maintain steam generation while maintaining safe and efficient operation.

#### 2. Control Loop Overview

The feedwater control loop consists of the following components:
- Feedwater flow transmitter (FT)
- Feedwater control valve (FCV)
- Feedwater pump (Pump 1)
- Feedwater flow setpoint (FLOW_SP)
- Feedwater flow controller (FLOW_PID)

The loop operates as follows:
1. The feedwater flow transmitter (FT) measures the flow rate of feedwater entering the steam generator.
2. The measured flow value is compared to the feedwater flow setpoint (FLOW_SP), which is typically a percentage of the maximum flow capacity.
3. If the flow is below the setpoint, the feedwater flow controller (FLOW_PID) adjusts the opening of the feedwater control valve (FCV) to increase the flow.
4. If the flow is above the setpoint, the controller reduces the valve opening to maintain the setpoint.
5. The feedwater pump (Pump 1) is controlled by the FCV, ensuring that it operates only when needed to maintain flow.

#### 3. Control Modes

The feedwater control loop operates in two modes:
- **Manual Mode**: The feedwater flow setpoint is manually adjusted by an operator. The controller does not adjust the valve position, and the pump remains off.
- **Automatic Mode**: The feedwater flow setpoint is automatically calculated based on steam pressure and demand. The controller adjusts the FCV and pump to maintain the desired flow.

#### 4. Control Parameters

- **Feedwater Flow Setpoint (FLOW_SP)**: The desired feedwater flow rate, typically expressed as a percentage of the maximum flow capacity (e.g., 95%).
- **Feedwater Flow Transmitter (FT)**: Measures the actual flow rate entering the steam generator.
- **Feedwater Control Valve (FCV)**: Adjusts the flow
