**Documentation for Urea Reaction Control Program**

**Purpose:**
The UreaReactionControl program automates the two-stage urea reaction process by managing valve operations, monitoring reactor pressure and temperature, and timing the reaction duration according to specified parameters.

**Variables:**

| Variable Name | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| stAmmoniaValve | BOOL | TRUE when ammonia valve is open |
| stCO2Valve | BOOL | TRUE when CO2 valve is open |
| rCurrentPressure | REAL | Current reactor pressure in bars |
| rCurrentTemperature | REAL | Current reactor temperature in ï¿½C |
| stAmmoniaValveControl | BOOL | TRUE to open ammonia valve |
| stCO2ValveControl | BOOL | TRUE to open CO2 valve |
| stStep1 | BOOL | TRUE when raw materials are loaded |
| stStep2 | BOOL | TRUE when reaction is controlled |
| stReactionFinished | BOOL | TRUE when reaction is finished |
| rTargetPressure | REAL | Target reactor pressure in bars |
| rPressureTolerance | REAL | Pressure tolerance in bars |
| rTargetTemperature | REAL | Target reactor temperature in ï¿½C |
| rTemperatureTolerance | REAL | Temperature tolerance in ï¿½C |
| tReactionTime | TIME | Total reaction time |
| tReactionTimer | TIME | Reaction timer |

**Control Flow:**

1. **Step 1: Load Raw Materials**
   - Open ammonia and COâ‚‚ valves.
   - Wait until both valves confirm open.
   - Record current time to start reaction timing.

2. **Step 2: Control Reaction**
   - Check if current pressure and temperature are within the target range.
   - If conditions are met, check if the reaction time has been reached.
   - Adjust valves based on pressure and temperature if conditions are not met.

3. **Final: Close Valves and Mark Reaction as Finished**
   - Close all valves.
   - Set the finished flag.

**Timer Logic:**
The CURRENT_TIME is used to track the duration of the reaction process. The reaction timer starts when the valves are confirmed open and stops when the reaction time is reached.

**Notes:**
- The program uses threshold values and tolerances to determine safe operation.
- The finished flag is set when the reaction is complete, and all valves are closed.
