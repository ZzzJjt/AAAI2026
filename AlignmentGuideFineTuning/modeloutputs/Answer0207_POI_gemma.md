### Intent:
The task involves implementing a Model Predictive Control (MPC) algorithm in Python to optimize wind farm operations by dynamically balancing turbine power outputs and battery storage while meeting load demands and respecting system constraints.  

**Intent:** *Generate Python code for an MPC controller that optimizes wind farm power distribution and battery storage in real-time.*

### Prompt:
**Model Predictive Control for Optimizing Robot Movement Using Python:**

Develop Python code to implement a model predictive control (MPC) algorithm for optimizing the movement of a robot. The control system should consider dynamic constraints, path planning, and obstacle avoidance while ensuring smooth, efficient, and adaptive movement in a dynamic environment.

**C-A-R-E:**

ðŸŸ¥ Cï¼ˆContextï¼‰

Robots operating in dynamic environments often face challenges such as moving obstacles, tight path constraints, and the need for smooth and efficient motion. Traditional control methods may not adapt quickly enough to ensure safe and optimal navigation, especially when real-time decisions are required.

ðŸŸ© Aï¼ˆActionï¼‰

Develop Python code to implement a model predictive control (MPC) algorithm for robot motion optimization. The controller should handle path planning, obstacle avoidance, and dynamic constraints, while continuously predicting and adjusting the robotâ€™s movement to maintain smooth and efficient operation.

ðŸŸ¨ Rï¼ˆResultï¼‰

The resulting MPC-controlled robot should demonstrate adaptive, real-time trajectory optimization, maintaining smooth motion and effectively avoiding collisions. Compared to static or reactive control methods, the MPC approach should provide more intelligent and reliable navigation in complex environments.

ðŸŸ¦ Eï¼ˆExampleï¼‰

For example, simulate a robot navigating through a corridor with moving obstacles. Show how the MPC predicts future positions, reroutes accordingly, and maintains a smooth trajectoryâ€”avoiding jerky movements and ensuring timely arrival at the goal.
