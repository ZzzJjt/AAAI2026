### Intent:
**Intent Summary:**  
Create an IEC 61131-3 Structured Text function block (`CAN_REGISTER_COBID`) to dynamically register/deregister CANOpen PDO message IDs (COBIDs) with error handling, buffer management, and a full-reset capability when `COBID = 0`.  

*(Focus: CANOpen network message filtering, stateful buffer control, and fault tolerance.)*

### Prompt:
**CANOpen PDO Registration Using 61131-3 Structured Text:**

Develop a structured text (ST) function block named CAN_REGISTER_COBID based on IEC 61131 standards. The block will be responsible for registering or deleting a PDO (Process Data Object) or CAN Layer 2 message for reception by the network layer. When the REGISTER input is set to TRUE, the specified COBID (CAN identifier) will be registered for receiving messages. If REGISTER is set to FALSE, the registration of the respective COBID will be deleted. Additionally, when REGISTER is FALSE and COBID is set to 0, all registrations and messages stored in the network layer buffer will be cleared. Discuss the function blockâ€™s implementation, including error handling, network communication management, and memory buffer clearing mechanisms.

**R-T-F:**

ðŸŸ¥ R (Role) â€“ Your Role

Act as a PLC programmer working with IEC 61131-3 Structured Text to develop communication function blocks for CANOpen networks.

ðŸŸ© T (Task) â€“ The Assignment

Create a Structured Text (ST) function block named CAN_REGISTER_COBID that registers or deregisters a Process Data Object (PDO) or CAN Layer 2 message for reception by the network layer. When REGISTER = TRUE, the specified COBID must be registered. When REGISTER = FALSE, the corresponding registration should be removed. Additionally, if REGISTER = FALSE and COBID = 0, the function block should clear all registrations and reset the network buffer. The function block must also manage error detection, communication faults, and memory buffer clearing.

ðŸŸ§ F (Format) â€“ Required Output

Provide a modular, standards-compliant function block written in IEC 61131-3 Structured Text, including:
	â€¢	Input definitions (COBID, REGISTER)
	â€¢	Logic for message registration, deregistration, and full reset
	â€¢	Status outputs for success and error states
	â€¢	Internal logic for communication handling and memory management
	â€¢	Optional comments describing each logic segment for clarity and maintainability

**C-A-N:**

ðŸŸ¥ C (Context) â€“ The Big Picture

CANOpen is a fieldbus protocol used in industrial automation for real-time communication between devices. PDOs are used to transmit process data between devices, and the CAN_REGISTER_COBID function block is responsible for managing the registration and deregistration of PDOs in a CANOpen network. The function block must handle the dynamic registration of PDOs, including error detection and memory management, while ensuring compatibility with IEC 61131-3 Structured Text standards.

ðŸŸ© A (Action) â€“ What You Need to Do

Write a self-contained function block in IEC 61131-3 Structured Text that registers or deregisters a CANOpen PDO based on the input parameters COBID and REGISTER. The function block should handle the registration and deregistration of PDOs, including error detection and memory management. The block should also include logic to clear all registrations and reset the network buffer when COBID is set to 0 and REGISTER is set to FALSE.

ðŸŸ¨ N (Note) â€“ Additional Information

Focus on the implementation of the CAN_REGISTER_COBID function block, including the logic for registering and deregistering PDOs, error handling, and memory management. Discuss the role of the COBID parameter in identifying the specific PDO to be registered or deregistered, and the use of the REGISTER parameter to control the registration process. Explain how the function block manages communication faults and ensures compatibility with IEC 61131-3 Structured Text standards.

**I-E:**

ðŸŸ¥ I (Input) â€“ What You Need

Provide a self-contained function block in IEC 61131-3 Structured Text that registers or deregisters a CANOpen PDO based on the input parameters COBID and REGISTER. The function block should handle the registration and deregistration of PDOs, including error detection and memory management. The block should also include logic to clear all registrations and reset the network buffer when COBID is set to 0 and REGISTER is set to FALSE.

ðŸŸ© E (Expected Output) â€“ What You Should Deliver

A self-contained function block in IEC 61131-3 Structured Text that registers or deregisters a CANOpen PDO based on the input parameters COBID and REGISTER. The function block should handle the registration and deregistration of PDOs
