### Intent:
The task is to develop a Structured Text program for maintaining a 2:1 ratio between two reactant flows in a chemical mixing process, with real-time adjustment, input validation, alarm handling, and diagnostic logging.

### Prompt:
**Ratio Control Mixing:**

Develop a self-contained IEC 61131-3 Structured Text program (not a function block) to implement ratio control for mixing two reactants in a 2:1 ratio. The program should maintain the desired ratio between the two reactants by adjusting their flow rates dynamically, ensuring that for every two parts of reactant A, one part of reactant B is added.

Include logic to monitor the flow rates of both reactants and adjust one flow rate relative to the other to maintain the 2:1 ratio. The program should also handle any disturbances or variations in flow, adjusting the control signals to correct for deviations from the target ratio. Discuss the importance of ratio control in maintaining the desired chemical composition and the impact of disturbances on the mixing process.


**C-A-R-E:**

ðŸŸ¥ C (Context) â€“ The Background

In chemical processing and blending operations, achieving the correct mixing ratio between reactants is essential for maintaining product consistency, yield, and safety. A common requirement is to maintain a fixed ratioâ€”such as 2:1â€”between two reactants. Variations in flow rate due to disturbances can lead to off-spec mixtures or unstable reactions, making ratio control a vital component of the control strategy.

ðŸŸ© A (Action) â€“ What to Implement

Develop a self-contained IEC 61131-3 Structured Text program (not a function block) that:
	â€¢	Monitors the actual flow rate of reactant A (Flow_A_PV) and reactant B (Flow_B_PV)
	â€¢	Calculates the required setpoint for reactant B to maintain a 2:1 ratio (A:B)
	â€¢	Updates the Flow_B_SP value dynamically based on changes in Aâ€™s flow rate
	â€¢	Optionally includes tolerance checking or alarms for ratio deviations
	â€¢	Ensures smooth response to flow variations and disturbances in the upstream process

ðŸŸ¨ R (Result) â€“ What You Should Achieve

The program should:
	â€¢	Maintain the specified 2:1 reactant ratio with real-time adjustment
	â€¢	Prevent incorrect mixtures by recalculating flow targets during disturbances
	â€¢	Enhance process quality and reliability, particularly in continuous mixing systems
	â€¢	Be ready for integration with PID controllers or actuator logic to physically adjust the dosing equipment

    Flow_A_PV : REAL;               // Measured flow of reactant A
    Flow_B_PV : REAL;               // Measured flow of reactant B
    Flow_B_SP : REAL;               // Desired setpoint flow for reactant B

    Ratio_Setpoint : REAL := 2.0;   // A:B = 2:1
    Actual_Ratio : REAL;
    Error : REAL;
    Tolerance : REAL := 0.05;       // Acceptable margin for ratio deviation
END_VAR

// Calculate actual ratio if Flow_B_PV > 0
IF Flow_B_PV > 0.0 THEN
    Actual_Ratio := Flow_A_PV / Flow_B_PV;
ELSE
    Actual_Ratio := 0.0;
END_IF

// Determine desired flow for reactant B
Flow_B_SP := Flow_A_PV / Ratio_Setpoint;

// Optional error check
Error := Actual_Ratio - Ratio_Setpoint;
// If ABS(Error) > Tolerance, raise alarm or flag for corrective action

    Flow_B_PV : REAL;               // Measured flow of reactant B

// Optional error check
Error := Actual_Ratio - Ratio_Setpoint;
// If ABS(Error) > Tolerance, raise alarm or flag for corrective action

// Update flow setpoint for reactant B
// (e.g., using PID controller or actuator logic)

**Input Validation:**

Implement input validation logic to ensure that the ratio setpoint is within a valid range. The program should also check for invalid or unexpected inputs, such as negative flow rates or zero flow rates, and handle them appropriately.

**Alarm Handling:**

Include logic to handle alarms and warnings related to the ratio control process. For example, the program could raise an alarm if the actual ratio deviates from the setpoint by more than a specified tolerance. The program should also log the alarm and any corrective actions taken.

**Diagnostic Logging:**

Include diagnostic logging to track the performance of the ratio control process. The program should log key process variables, such as the actual ratio, setpoint, and flow rates, as well as any alarms or warnings that occur. This information can be used to analyze the performance of the ratio control process and identify areas for improvement.

**Real-Time Adjustment:**

The program should adjust the flow rates of the reactants in real-time to maintain the desired ratio. This may involve using PID controllers or other control algorithms to adjust the flow setpoints based on the actual flow rates and the desired ratio.

**Disturbance Handling:**

The program should be able to handle disturbances in the upstream process, such as changes in flow rates or pressure, and adjust the flow rates of the reactants accordingly. This may involve using disturbance rejection or feedforward control techniques to anticipate and compensate for disturbances.

**Integration with Other Control Systems:**

The program should be designed to integrate with other control systems, such as PID controllers or actuator logic, to physically adjust the dosing equipment and maintain the desired ratio. This may involve using communication protocols, such as Modbus or OPC, to exchange data with other control systems.

**Robustness and Stability:**

The program should be robust and stable, with minimal impact on the performance of other control systems or the overall process. This may involve using techniques such as deadband or anti-windup to prevent oscillations or other undesirable behavior.

**Scalability and Extensibility:**

The program should be designed to be scalable and extensible, allowing it to be used in a variety of mixing processes with different reactant ratios and flow rates. This may involve using modular or object-oriented programming techniques to make the program easier to maintain and modify.

**Documentation and Testing:**

The program should be well-documented and thoroughly tested to ensure that it meets
