### Intent:
**Intent Summary:**  
Develop an IEC 61131-3 Structured Text program implementing cascade control for a heat exchanger, where an outer temperature loop sets the flow setpoint for an inner flow loop to improve dynamic response and stability.

### Prompt:
**Cascade Control Heat Exchanger:**

Develop a self-contained IEC 61131-3 Structured Text program (not a function block) to implement cascade control for regulating the temperature in a heat exchanger. The outer loop should control the temperature setpoint based on the process requirements, while the inner loop controls the flow rate of the heating medium to adjust the temperature dynamically.

The program should manage the interaction between the primary and secondary control loops, ensuring that the inner loop responds quickly to disturbances, while the outer loop provides overall temperature stability. Include typical parameter values for temperature control and flow adjustments, and discuss the advantages of using cascade control in heat exchanger systems, particularly in improving response times and maintaining stable temperature control under varying load conditions.

**R-I-S-E:**

ðŸŸ¥ R (Role) â€“ Your Role

You are a PLC control engineer developing an IEC 61131-3 Structured Text (ST) program to implement a cascade control strategy for a heat exchanger system. Your goal is to improve temperature regulation by managing both process dynamics and fast disturbances.

â¸»

ðŸŸ© I (Input) â€“ What Youâ€™re Given
	â€¢	Control objective: Maintain the outlet temperature of a heat exchanger at a setpoint (e.g., 85.0â€¯Â°C).
	â€¢	Cascade structure:
	â€¢	Outer loop (primary): temperature control â€“ compares the outlet temperature with the setpoint and sets the desired flow rate.
	â€¢	Inner loop (secondary): flow control â€“ adjusts the heating mediumâ€™s flow rate to meet the outer loopâ€™s demand.
	â€¢	Available variables:
	â€¢	Temp_SP, Temp_PV â€“ temperature setpoint and measured temperature
	â€¢	Flow_SP, Flow_PV â€“ flow setpoint and measured flow
	â€¢	Proportional gains: Kp_Outer := 1.0, Kp_Inner := 2.0
	â€¢	The program runs on a PLC platform supporting Structured Text.

â¸»

ðŸŸ§ S (Steps) â€“ What You Need to Do
	1.	Calculate the outer loop error:
	â€¢	Temp_Error := Temp_SP - Temp_PV
	â€¢	Flow_SP := Kp_Outer * Temp_Error
	2.	Feed the result to the inner loop:
	â€¢	Compare Flow_SP with Flow_PV
	â€¢	Flow_Output := Kp_Inner * (Flow_SP - Flow_PV)
	3.	Drive the flow control valve using Flow_Output
	4.	Comment your logic clearly and use realistic setpoints and gains
	5.	Ensure the inner loop updates faster than the outer loop to reflect cascade dynamics

â¸»

ðŸŸ¦ E (Expectation) â€“ What Success Looks Like

Your completed program will:
	â€¢	Accurately maintain the heat exchangerâ€™s outlet temperature at the desired setpoint
	â€¢	React quickly to disturbances in heating flow via the fast inner loop
	â€¢	Improve system stability and response time compared to single-loop control
	â€¢	Be modular, scalable, and ready for real-world deployment
