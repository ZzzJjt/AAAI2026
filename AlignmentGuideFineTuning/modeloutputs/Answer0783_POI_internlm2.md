### Intent:
**Intent Summary:**  
Create an IEC 61131-3 structured text function block to convert a 10-digit decimal number (LINT) into a hexadecimal string, handling edge cases (zero, max limits) and outputting a cleanly formatted result for industrial diagnostics.  

*(Focus: Modular, scan-cycle-safe conversion utility for PLCs.)*

### Prompt:
**DecToHex:**
Implement a self-contained function block in IEC 61131-3 structured text to convert a 10-digit decimal value to hexadecimal. Ensure proper handling of large values and edge cases.

**R-T-F:**

ðŸŸ¥ R (Role) â€“ Define Your Role

Act as a PLC software engineer tasked with creating a conversion utility in IEC 61131-3 Structured Text for use in industrial control systems.

ðŸŸ© T (Task) â€“ Define the Objective

Implement a self-contained function block that converts a 10-digit decimal number into a hexadecimal string. The function must:
	â€¢	Accept a large decimal input (e.g., LINT type)
	â€¢	Perform accurate decimal-to-hex conversion
	â€¢	Handle edge cases, including:
	â€¢	Input = 0
	â€¢	Maximum numeric limits
	â€¢	Type safety and formatting
	â€¢	Output a valid hexadecimal string for use in diagnostics, logging, or communications

The block should be modular, efficient, and safe for execution in scan-cycle-based PLC environments.

ðŸŸ§ F (Format) â€“ Specify the Output Format

Provide:
	â€¢	A full IEC 61131-3 Structured Text function block
	â€¢	Input: DecValue : LINT
	â€¢	Output: HexString : STRING
	â€¢	Internal logic to convert decimal to hexadecimal using division/modulus operations and character mapping
	â€¢	Edge case handling (e.g., return '0' if input is 0)
	â€¢	Inline comments explaining each section of the code
	â€¢	Optional: trimming leading zeros for clean output
