### Intent:
**Intent Summary:**

### Prompt:
**PID Pressure Control Chemical Reactor:**

Develop a self-contained IEC 61131-3 Structured Text program to implement PID feedback control for regulating the pressure in a chemical reactor. The program should continuously adjust the opening of a pressure control valve based on a setpoint to maintain optimal pressure levels within the reactor.

Include the PID control loop parameters (proportional, integral, and derivative gains) and ensure the logic accounts for pressure deviations from the setpoint. The program should also include safeguards to prevent over-pressurization or under-pressurization by limiting the valve’s operational range. Discuss the critical role of pressure control in chemical reactors, emphasizing safety, process efficiency, and system stability under dynamic reaction conditions.

**B-A-B:**

🟥 B (Before) – The Challenge

In a chemical reactor, maintaining the correct pressure level is essential for reaction stability, process efficiency, and operator safety. Without precise control, pressure fluctuations can lead to over-pressurization risks, incomplete reactions, or equipment failure, especially under dynamic reaction conditions.

⸻

🟩 A (After) – The Ideal Outcome

Develop a self-contained IEC 61131-3 Structured Text program that:
	•	Implements a PID feedback control loop to continuously regulate reactor pressure
	•	Adjusts the pressure control valve opening in real time to maintain a predefined pressure setpoint
	•	Uses properly tuned PID parameters (Kp, Ki, Kd) for responsive and stable control
	•	Limits the valve output to prevent under- or over-pressurization
	•	Supports safe, stable, and efficient reactor operation during varying process conditions

🟧 B (Bridge) – The Implementation Strategy

Use the following IEC 61131-3 Structured Text template to implement the PID logic:

VAR
    // Process inputs
    Pressure_PV : REAL;                  // Measured reactor pressure
    Pressure_SP : REAL := 5.0;           // Target pressure (e.g., bar)

    // PID tuning
    Kp : REAL := 2.0;
    Ki : REAL := 0.8;
    Kd : REAL := 0.3;

    // PID internals
    Error : REAL;
    Prev_Error : REAL := 0.0;
    Integral : REAL := 0.0;
    Derivative : REAL;
    Valve_Output : REAL;

    // Safety limits for the valve
    Valve_Min : REAL := 0.0;
    Valve_Max : REAL := 100.0;
END_VAR

// PID control logic (100 ms sample time)
Error := Pressure_SP - Pressure_PV;
Integral := Integral + Error * 0.1;
Derivative := (Error - Prev_Error) / 0.1;

Valve_Output := (Kp * Error) + (Ki * Integral) + (Kd * Derivative);

// Clamp output to safe range
IF Valve_Output > Valve_Max THEN
    Valve_Output := Valve_Max;
ELSIF Valve_Output < Valve_Min THEN
    Valve_Output := Valve_Min;
END_IF

Prev_Error := Error;
