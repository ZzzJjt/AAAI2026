**C-A-R-E:**

ðŸŸ¥ C (Context) â€“ Background Situation

In industrial automation, especially in HVAC, chemical processing, and sensor integration, accurate and reliable temperature conversions between Fahrenheit and Celsius are essential. Many legacy systems and sensors operate in Fahrenheit, while modern control logic and displays often require Celsius. Without a dedicated function block, engineers must repeatedly implement conversion logic, increasing the risk of errors and scan-cycle inefficiencies.

â¸»

ðŸŸ© A (Action) â€“ Task to Perform

Develop a self-contained function block in IEC 61131-3 Structured Text that:
	â€¢	Accepts a Fahrenheit temperature as input
	â€¢	Converts it to Celsius using the formula
	â€¢	Includes input validation to reject values below absolute zero
	â€¢	Outputs both the Celsius temperature and a boolean flag indicating the validity of the input
	â€¢	Ensures scan-cycle safety and industrial compatibility

â¸»

ðŸŸ§ R (Result) â€“ Desired Outcome

The function block should:
	â€¢	Be reusable in various temperature control applications
	â€¢	Operate efficiently within scan cycles, avoiding unnecessary delays
	â€¢	Provide clear, accurate results and status flags for downstream logic
	â€¢	Be well-documented with comments explaining the conversion process and validation logic
	â€¢	Enable PLC programmers to focus on system logic rather than repeated conversion code
