### Intent:
**Intent Summary:**  
Create a reusable Structured Text function block for real-time cubic spline interpolation in PLCs, handling input arrays of x/y points to compute smooth interpolated values efficiently while managing edge cases and performance constraints.

### Prompt:
**Spline Interpolation:**

Develop a self-contained function block in IEC 61131-3 Structured Text to compute spline interpolation over a set of data points. Ensure that the function block is modular and efficient, with comments explaining the steps involved in constructing and evaluating the spline. Address potential computational challenges, such as memory usage and processing time, and discuss the advantages of spline interpolation in comparison to linear methods, particularly in applications where smooth curve fitting is essential.

**R-I-S-E:**

🟥 R (Role) – Your Role

You are a PLC programmer or control systems engineer responsible for implementing precise and smooth interpolation methods in IEC 61131-3 Structured Text. Your task is to design a function block that enables real-time spline interpolation between a set of known data points in industrial automation applications.

⸻

🟩 I (Input) – What You’re Given

You are required to develop a function block that:
	•	Takes as inputs:
	•	X : ARRAY[1..N] OF REAL — known x-values
	•	Y : ARRAY[1..N] OF REAL — known corresponding y-values
	•	TargetX : REAL — the x-value at which to evaluate the interpolated y
	•	Produces as output:
	•	InterpolatedY : REAL — the spline-interpolated y-value at TargetX

You must also consider:
	•	Ensuring smoothness and continuity of the interpolation
	•	Optimizing the algorithm for limited memory and processing time on a PLC
	•	Providing clear documentation and reusable structure

⸻

🟧 S (Steps) – What You Need to Do
	1.	Create a function block named SplineInterpolator with appropriate input/output declarations.
	2.	Design the logic to:
	•	Identify the interval [X[i], X[i+1]] that contains TargetX
	•	Use precomputed cubic spline coefficients (a, b, c, d) for that segment
	•	Evaluate the spline using the formula:
y = a + b(x - x_i) + c(x - x_i)^2 + d(x - x_i)^3
	3.	Comment the code to explain:
	•	How spline coefficients are structured
	•	How the interval is selected at runtime
	•	How the evaluation is performed efficiently within one scan cycle
	4.	Handle edge cases:
	•	Clamp TargetX if it’s out of bounds
	•	Warn about insufficient data points (fewer than 3)
	•	Flag potential memory/performance limitations for large datasets

⸻

🟦 E (Expectation) – What Success Looks Like

You deliver a real-time capable, reusable function block that:
	•	Computes smooth, continuous interpolated values over a set of known points
	•	Minimizes runtime computation by separating initialization and evaluation phases
	•	Improves curve fidelity in applications such as:
	•	Motion trajectory generation
	•	Signal smoothing
	•	Profile-based control (e.g., temperature, pressure, flow)

The solution enables high-quality interpolation directly within the PLC, without relying on external devices or approximation hacks.
