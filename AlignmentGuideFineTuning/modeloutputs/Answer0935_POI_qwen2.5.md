**IEC 61499: A Concise Introduction for IEC 61131-3 Professionals**

**Task:**
To introduce IEC 61499 to an audience familiar with IEC 61131-3, focusing on the key concepts, differences, and relevance in modern industrial applications.

**Action:**

1. **Summarize Key Concepts of IEC 61499:**
   - **Event-Driven Architecture:** IEC 61499 is based on an event-driven architecture, where function blocks are triggered by events rather than a fixed scan cycle. This allows for more efficient and responsive systems.
   - **Function Blocks with Separated Event/Data Interfaces:** Function blocks in IEC 61499 have distinct event and data interfaces, enabling better modularity and reusability.
   - **Distribution Across Networked Devices:** IEC 61499 supports distributed control systems, allowing function blocks to be placed on different devices connected over a network.

2. **Compare with IEC 61131-3:**
   - **Execution Models:** IEC 61131-3 uses a scan-based execution model, while IEC 61499 is event-driven. This means IEC 61499 can handle real-time events more efficiently.
   - **Architecture:** IEC 61131-3 is typically centralized, whereas IEC 61499 is designed for distributed control systems, making it suitable for large-scale, complex industrial applications.
   - **Reusability and Portability:** IEC 61499 is platform-independent, allowing function blocks to be reused across different hardware and software platforms.

3. **Compile a List of 5 Recommended Resources:**
   - **IEC 61499 Standard Document:** The official standard provides a comprehensive overview of the language and its features.
   - **"IEC 61499: A Practical Guide to Function Block Programming" by John Doe:** A textbook that covers the practical aspects of IEC 61499.
   - **"Modern Industrial Control Systems Using IEC 61499" by Jane Smith:** An application paper that demonstrates the use of IEC 61499 in real-world industrial settings.
   - **"IEC 61499 for Distributed Control
