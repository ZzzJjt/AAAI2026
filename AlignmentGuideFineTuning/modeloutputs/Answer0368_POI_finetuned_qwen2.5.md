### Intent:
**Intent Summary:**  
Create a non-recursive, scan-cycle-safe quicksort function block in IEC 61131-3 Structured Text to efficiently sort integer arrays in PLC applications using stack-emulated iteration and Lomuto partitioning.

### Prompt:
**Quicksort:**
Implement a self-contained function block in IEC 61131-3 structured text to perform the quicksort algorithm on an array of integers. Ensure efficient partitioning and recursion handling.

**C-A-R-E:**

ðŸŸ¥ C (Context) â€“ Background Situation

Sorting integer arrays efficiently is a common requirement in PLC-based systemsâ€”for example, in alarm prioritization, measurement filtering, or report generation. While quicksort is a widely used and efficient algorithm, its typical implementation relies on recursion, which is not supported in many IEC 61131-3 Structured Text environments. Therefore, implementing quicksort for industrial controllers requires a scan-cycle-safe, non-recursive solution.

ðŸŸ© A (Action) â€“ Task to Perform

Develop a self-contained function block in Structured Text that implements the quicksort algorithm for an array of integers. The function block should:
	â€¢	Sort the array in place using an iterative approach
	â€¢	Replace recursive calls with stack-emulated logic (e.g., using two arrays for lower and upper bounds of subarrays)
	â€¢	Use an efficient partitioning scheme, such as Lomuto or Hoare
	â€¢	Include input signals like Execute : BOOL and output signals like Done : BOOL
	â€¢	Be written in a modular, structured style with inline comments for maintainability

â¸»

ðŸŸ¨ R (Result) â€“ Expected Outcome

The result will be a robust, scan-cycle-safe sorting block that can be reused in any PLC program requiring fast array sorting. It will:
	â€¢	Complete the sorting without recursion
	â€¢	Be efficient even for large arrays (e.g., 100+ elements)
	â€¢	Comply with IEC 61131-3 standards
	â€¢	Be easy to integrate, modify, or extend for future applications

ðŸŸ¦ E (Example) â€“ Concrete Illustration

Example logic for emulating recursion with a loop and index stack:

// Pseudocode structure inside the function block:
WHILE StackPointer > 0 DO
   Low := LowStack[StackPointer];
   High := HighStack[StackPointer];
   StackPointer := StackPointer - 1;

   IF Low < High THEN
      PartitionIndex := Partition(InputArray, Low, High);
      // Push left and right subarrays onto the stack
      StackPointer := StackPointer + 1;
      LowStack[StackPointer] := Low;
      HighStack[StackPointer] := PartitionIndex - 1;

      StackPointer := StackPointer + 1;
      LowStack[StackPointer] := PartitionIndex + 1;
      HighStack[StackPointer] := High;
   END_IF;
END_WHILE;

**Intent summary:**  
Implement a self-contained, scan-cycle-safe quicksort function block in IEC 61131-3 Structured Text to efficiently sort integer arrays without recursion, using stack emulation for subarray partitioning and iteration.  

**C-A-R-E:**

ðŸŸ¥ C (Context) â€“ Background Situation

Sorting integer arrays is a common requirement in industrial automation, such as prioritizing alarms, managing sensor data, or preparing structured outputs. However, many PLC platforms do not support recursion, making it difficult to implement traditional quicksort algorithms. Therefore, a scan-cycle-safe, iterative quicksort function block is needed to ensure efficient and reliable sorting in PLC environments.
