### Intent:
**Intent Summary:**  
Develop an IEC 61131-3 Structured Text program to control a conveyor belt with manual/automatic modes, prioritizing safety stops from three stations and halting if sensors miss objects, while maintaining a fixed speed of 2 m/s.  

*(Focus: Safety, dual-mode logic, sensor/station inputs, constant speed, and diagnostic logging.)*

### Prompt:
**Conveyor Belt Control Using 61131-3 Structured Text:**

Write a self-contained 61131-3 structured text program (not a function block) to control a conveyor belt system with three stations, where each station allows a user to stop the conveyor. The system should automatically start and stop based on input from five sensors that detect the presence of objects on the conveyor. The conveyor belt speed must be maintained at 2 meters per second. The program should manage both manual and automatic control modes while ensuring safe and efficient operation.

Implement logic that prioritizes safety by ensuring the conveyor stops if any station triggers a stop command or if an object is not detected by the sensors.

**C-A-R-E:**

ðŸŸ¥ C (Context) â€“ The Background

In modern industrial automation, conveyor belt systems often need to balance automatic object tracking with manual operator control at different stations. Ensuring safe, real-time decisionsâ€”such as stopping when an object is missing or when a human intervenesâ€”is critical. Using IEC 61131-3 Structured Text (ST) to implement such control allows for precise logic, structured modes, and robust safety enforcement without relying on external hardware logic.

ðŸŸ© A (Action) â€“ The Implementation Task

Develop a self-contained Structured Text program (not a function block) to control a conveyor belt system that includes:
	â€¢	Three operator stations, each capable of stopping the conveyor
	â€¢	Five sensors that detect the presence of items on the belt
	â€¢	Two operating modes:
	â€¢	Manual mode, where station commands have direct control
	â€¢	Automatic mode, where the conveyor only runs when all five sensors detect items

Additional control requirements:
	â€¢	Maintain conveyor speed at a constant 2 meters per second (logical only; no speed regulation code required)
	â€¢	Ensure safety logic takes priority:
	â€¢	Stop immediately if any station sends a stop signal
	â€¢	Stop if any sensor fails to detect an object in automatic mode
	â€¢	Clearly separate control logic for both manual and automatic modes
	â€¢	Ensure code is readable, scalable, and standards-compliant

â¸»

ðŸŸ¨ R (Result) â€“ The Expected Outcome

The resulting Structured Text program will:
	â€¢	Accurately control the conveyor belt in both manual and automatic modes
	â€¢	Safely halt the system if a manual stop is triggered or a sensor condition fails
	â€¢	Maintain a constant speed (2 m/s) logic, showing real-time operability
	â€¢	Be easy to modify for future expansion (e.g., more stations or sensors)
	â€¢	Be suitable for deployment in real-world manufacturing or packaging lines where operator override and object tracking must coexist

// Diagnostic logging (not implemented in this example)
// This would typically involve logging the state of the system, including sensor readings, station stop commands, and the conveyor's running status.

// Example of how to implement a simple logging mechanism (not part of the core control logic)
// LOG("Sensor1: " + BOOL_TO_STRING(Sensor1));
// LOG("Sensor2: " + BOOL_TO_STRING(Sensor2));
// LOG("Sensor3: " + BOOL_TO_STRING(Sensor3));
// LOG("Sensor4: " + BOOL_TO_STRING(Sensor4));
// LOG("Sensor5: " + BOOL_TO_STRING(Sensor5));

// LOG("AutoMode: " + BOOL_TO_STRING(AutoMode));
// LOG("ManualMode: " + BOOL_TO_STRING(ManualMode));
// LOG("ConveyorRunning: " + BOOL_TO_STRING(ConveyorRunning));

// Note: The above logging is for illustrative purposes and would need to be implemented in a real-world scenario.

This structured text program provides a basic framework for controlling a conveyor belt system with safety features and dual control modes. It demonstrates how to prioritize safety, manage sensor inputs, and switch between manual and automatic control modes. The program is designed to be easily understood and modified for future enhancements.
