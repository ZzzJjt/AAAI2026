### Intent:
**Intent Summary:**  
Develop an automated control narrative for ethanol fermentation, specifying setpoints, control methods, and safety logic for temperature, pH, agitation, and foam management to ensure stable, high-yield production.  

*(Focus: Structured automation guidance for fermentation control parameters.)*

### Prompt:
**Control Narrative for Ethanol Production**

Create a control narrative for ethanol production including concrete setpoints and ranges.

Create a detailed explanation of each control step during Fermentation. Create one paragraph per subsection in Section 3.

**T-A-G:**

ðŸŸ¥ T (Task)

Develop a control narrative for an ethanol production process, with emphasis on the fermentation phase, including all critical parameters and automation logic.

â¸»

ðŸŸ© A (Action)
	â€¢	Specify concrete setpoints and ranges for key fermentation variables such as temperature (e.g., 32â€“35â€¯Â°C), pH (e.g., 4.5â€“5.0), and agitation speed.
	â€¢	Break Section 3: Fermentation into logical subsections (e.g., 3.1 Inoculation, 3.2 Temperature Control, 3.3 pH Adjustment, 3.4 Agitation, 3.5 Foam Control).
	â€¢	For each subsection, write one paragraph that describes:
	â€¢	The control objective
	â€¢	Setpoints or control bands
	â€¢	The control method (e.g., PID, on/off logic)
	â€¢	Any feedback sensors, interlocks, or alarm thresholds used to ensure safe and stable operation

â¸»

ðŸŸ¦ G (Goal)

Deliver a structured, detailed, and implementation-ready control narrative that helps automation engineers, operators, and system integrators understand how the fermentation stage is controlled, why it matters, and how the system should respond to deviationsâ€”ensuring safe, high-yield ethanol production.

**R-I-S-E:**

ðŸŸ¥ R (Role) â€“ Define Your Role

Act as a control systems engineer or automation process control lead responsible for documenting the control narrative for an ethanol production process, with a focus on the fermentation phase.

â¸»

ðŸŸ© I (Input) â€“ Information Provided

You are already familiar with the ethanol production process, including the fermentation stage. You need to document the control narrative for Section 3: Fermentation, which includes subsections such as Inoculation, Temperature Control, pH Adjustment, Agitation, and Foam Control.

â¸»

ðŸŸ§ S (Steps) â€“ Steps to Perform

	1.	Define the control narrative structure for Section 3: Fermentation, with subsections for each critical control step.
	2.	For each subsection, write one paragraph that:
	â€¢	Describes the control objective
	â€¢	Specifies the setpoints or control ranges
	â€¢	Details the control method (e.g., PID, on/off logic)
	â€¢	Includes relevant instrumentation (e.g., sensors, actuators) and safety interlocks
	â€¢	Mentions any alarms or thresholds for deviation handling
	3.	Ensure that the control narrative is clear, concise, and includes all necessary details for someone to implement or maintain the control system.

ðŸŸ© E (Example) â€“ Sample Output

	â€¢	3.1 Inoculation: The control narrative should include the step of inoculating the fermentation medium with the appropriate yeast strain. The control objective is to ensure that the inoculation process is carried out at the correct time and with the appropriate amount of inoculum. The control narrative should include the setpoint for the inoculation step, as well as any relevant instrumentation or control logic used to ensure that the inoculation process is carried out properly.
	â€¢	3.2 Temperature Control: The control narrative should include the step of controlling the temperature of the fermentation process. The control objective is to maintain the temperature within a specified range to ensure optimal fermentation conditions. The control narrative should include the setpoints for the temperature control system, as well as any relevant instrumentation or control logic used to maintain the temperature within the specified range.
	â€¢	3.3 pH Adjustment: The control narrative should include the step of adjusting the pH of the fermentation process. The control objective is to maintain the pH within a specified range to ensure optimal fermentation conditions. The control narrative should include the setpoints for the pH control system, as well as any relevant instrumentation
