### Intent:
**Intent Summary:**  
Create a reusable IEC 61131-3 Structured Text function block to compute the sine of an angle (in radians) using either built-in `SIN()` or a Taylor series approximation, with documentation on precision, performance, and real-time constraints for PLC applications.  

*(For the matrix multiplication example, the intent would be: "Implement a 4x4 matrix multiplication function block in Structured Text with optimized loops and clear documentation for industrial control applications.")*

### Prompt:
**Sine Function**

Develop a self-contained function block in IEC 61131-3 Structured Text to compute the sine of a given angle in radians. Ensure that the function block is modular and reusable, with appropriate comments detailing the mathematical operations involved. Include a discussion on the precision of the sine function within the context of PLC programming and its potential limitations in real-time applications.

**B-A-B:**

ðŸŸ¥ B (Before) â€“ The Challenge

In industrial automation, trigonometric functions like sine are frequently needed for applications such as robotics, motion control, and waveform generation. However, some PLC environments using IEC 61131-3 Structured Text may not offer direct access to high-precision trigonometric libraries. Even when built-in functions are available, their real-time performance, resolution, and precision may vary depending on the hardware and runtime.

ðŸŸ© A (After) â€“ The Ideal Outcome

Develop a self-contained function block in IEC 61131-3 Structured Text, named SineFunction, that:
	â€¢	Accepts one input:
	â€¢	AngleRad : REAL â€” an angle in radians
	â€¢	Outputs one result:
	â€¢	SineValue : REAL â€” the sine of the input angle
	â€¢	Uses either:
	â€¢	The built-in SIN() function (if available)
	â€¢	Or a Taylor series approximation for environments without SIN()
	â€¢	Is modular, reusable, and clearly commented:
	â€¢	Explain the use of radians, not degrees
	â€¢	Document precision considerations, especially for approximations
	â€¢	Includes a brief discussion (in code comments or documentation) about:
	â€¢	Accuracy limitations due to floating-point precision
	â€¢	Performance implications in real-time scan cycles
	â€¢	Trade-offs between speed and accuracy for embedded use

ðŸŸ§ B (Bridge) â€“ The Implementation Strategy

To build this function block:
	1.	Declare the interface:
 FUNCTION_BLOCK SineFunction
VAR_INPUT
    AngleRad : REAL;
END_VAR
VAR_OUTPUT
    SineValue : REAL;
END_VAR
2.	Implement the core logic:
	â€¢	If the platform supports it:
 SineValue := SIN(AngleRad);
 	â€¢	If not, use a Taylor series (first 5â€“7 terms for reasonable precision):
  VAR
    x, x2, x3, x5, x7 : REAL;
END_VAR

x := AngleRad;
x2 := x * x;
x3 := x2 * x;
x5 := x3 * x2;
x7 := x5 * x2;
SineValue := x - (x3 / 6.0) + (x5 / 120.0) - (x7 / 5040.0);
3.	Add comments and notes:
	â€¢	Explain why radians are used
	â€¢	Discuss that sine values are periodic and bounded between -1 and 1
	â€¢	Warn that the approximation is best near zero, and large angles should be normalized
4.	Optional: Include a UseApproximation : BOOL input if both modes are supported
