### Intent:
**Intent Summary:**  
Create a Structured Text program that maintains a 2:1 flow ratio between two reactants (A and B) with safety checks, emergency stop handling, and alarm management for an industrial mixing process.

### Prompt:
**Programming Reference:**
Compile a comprehensive list of all valid keywords used in the IEC 61131-3 Structured Text programming language, ensuring that it covers both standard control flow structures and data types. Include examples of usage for key functions where applicable.

**T-A-G:**

游린 T (Task)

Create a programming reference for the IEC 61131-3 Structured Text (ST) language by compiling a complete list of valid keywords.

游릴 A (Action)

Gather and categorize all official keywords specified in the IEC 61131-3 standard, including control flow structures (such as IF, CASE, FOR), standard functions (TON, CTU, ABS), and data types (INT, REAL, BOOL). Include concise usage examples or code snippets to illustrate how key functions and structures are typically used in automation programming.

游릱 G (Goal)

Deliver a well-organized, easy-to-use reference guide that supports engineers and developers in writing correct, efficient, and standards-compliant Structured Text code for industrial control systems.
