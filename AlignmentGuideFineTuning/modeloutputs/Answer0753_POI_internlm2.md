### Intent:
**Intent Summary:**  
Develop an IEC 61131-3 Structured Text program for feedforward control of a chemical mixing process, dynamically adjusting Reactant A's flow rate based on Reactant B's measured flow, concentration, and temperature, while enforcing safety constraints and input validation.  

*(Focus: Proactive flow ratio control with compensation for process variables and robust error handling.)*

### Prompt:
**Feedforward Control Conveyor:**

Develop a self-contained IEC 61131-3 Structured Text program (not a function block) to implement feedforward control for adjusting the speed of a conveyor belt based on sensor-predicted load changes. The program should use input from sensors that predict the weight or volume of material entering the conveyor system, allowing for real-time adjustments to the belt speed before a load change occurs.

Include logic that calculates the required conveyor speed based on the predicted load and adjusts the motor speed accordingly, ensuring that the conveyor operates efficiently without overloading or underloading. Discuss the benefits of feedforward control in conveyor systems, particularly in reducing delays and improving response times compared to feedback-only control strategies.

ðŸŸ¥ R (Role) â€“ Your Role

You are a PLC programmer assigned to develop an IEC 61131-3 Structured Text control routine for a conveyor belt system. Your goal is to implement feedforward control to proactively adjust the speed of the conveyor based on predicted material load, ensuring smooth and efficient transport.

ðŸŸ© T (Task) â€“ What You Need to Do

Write a self-contained Structured Text program (not a function block) that:
	1.	Receives input from upstream sensors predicting material load (e.g., weight or volume).
	2.	Calculates the required conveyor speed using a feedforward gain (Gain_FF) and a base speed (Base_Speed).
	3.	Limits the conveyor speed to safe operational bounds (e.g., min 0.5 m/s, max 2.0 m/s).
	4.	Outputs the computed speed to control the conveyor motor in real time.

ðŸŸ§ F (Format) â€“ Expected Output

You should output a complete and clean Structured Text code block like this:
VAR
    // Inputs
    Predicted_Load : REAL;        // kg or volume units from sensor
    Base_Speed : REAL := 1.0;     // Minimum conveyor speed (m/s)
    Gain_FF : REAL := 0.02;       // Speed increase per unit load

    // Output
    Conveyor_Speed : REAL;
END_VAR

// Feedforward control logic
Conveyor_Speed := Base_Speed + Gain_FF * Predicted_Load;

// Clamp speed within operating limits
IF Conveyor_Speed > 2.0 THEN
    Conveyor_Speed := 2.0;
ELSIF Conveyor_Speed < 0.5 THEN
    Conveyor_Speed := 0.5;
END_IF

// Conveyor_Speed is sent to motor control interface
This structure ensures:
	â€¢	Proactive speed adjustment based on predicted changes
	â€¢	Improved material handling efficiency
	â€¢	Simple logic thatâ€™s easy to tune, expand, or integrate with a feedback loop

ðŸŸ© R (Reasoning) â€“ Why You're Doing It

Feedforward control is a proactive control strategy that anticipates changes in the process and adjusts the control action before the change occurs. In the context of a conveyor belt system, feedforward control can help prevent delays and improve response times compared to feedback-only control strategies.

By using sensors to predict the material load entering the conveyor system, the program can calculate the required conveyor speed in real time and adjust the motor speed accordingly. This proactive approach ensures that the conveyor operates efficiently without overloading or underloading, leading to improved material handling efficiency and reduced wear and tear on the conveyor belt.

ðŸŸ© T (Tips) â€“ How to Do It

1.	Define the inputs and outputs of the program, including the predicted load, base speed, feedforward gain, and conveyor speed.
2.	Use the feedforward gain to calculate the required conveyor speed based on the predicted load.
3.	Limit the conveyor speed within safe operational bounds to prevent overloading or underloading.
4.	Output the computed conveyor speed to control the conveyor motor in real time.
