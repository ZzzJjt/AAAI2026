### Intent:
**Intent Summary:**  
Create an IEC 61131-3 Structured Text program to maintain a 2:1 ratio between two reactant flows (A:B) by dynamically adjusting flow rates, ensuring consistent chemical composition despite disturbances.  

*(Focus: Ratio control logic, real-time flow adjustment, and disturbance handling for mixing processes.)*

### Prompt:
**Ratio Control Mixing:**

Develop a self-contained IEC 61131-3 Structured Text program (not a function block) to implement ratio control for mixing two reactants in a 2:1 ratio. The program should maintain the desired ratio between the two reactants by adjusting their flow rates dynamically, ensuring that for every two parts of reactant A, one part of reactant B is added.

Include logic to monitor the flow rates of both reactants and adjust one flow rate relative to the other to maintain the 2:1 ratio. The program should also handle any disturbances or variations in flow, adjusting the control signals to correct for deviations from the target ratio. Discuss the importance of ratio control in maintaining the desired chemical composition and the impact of disturbances on the mixing process.

**B-A-B:**

ðŸŸ¥ B (Before) â€“ The Challenge

In continuous chemical mixing processes, maintaining the correct mixing ratio of reactants is essential for ensuring product quality and process efficiency. Without ratio control, deviations in flow due to pump inconsistencies or process disturbances can result in incorrect formulations, leading to off-spec products, waste, or even hazardous reactions.

ðŸŸ§ B (Bridge) â€“ The Implementation Strategy

Hereâ€™s an example Structured Text implementation of the ratio control logic:

VAR
    Flow_A_PV : REAL;               // Measured flow rate of reactant A
    Flow_B_PV : REAL;               // Measured flow rate of reactant B
    Flow_B_SP : REAL;               // Setpoint flow for reactant B

    Ratio_Setpoint : REAL := 2.0;   // Desired ratio A:B = 2:1
    Tolerance : REAL := 0.05;       // Acceptable ratio error margin

    Actual_Ratio : REAL;
    Error : REAL;
END_VAR

// Calculate actual ratio
IF Flow_B_PV > 0.0 THEN
    Actual_Ratio := Flow_A_PV / Flow_B_PV;
ELSE
    Actual_Ratio := 0.0;
END_IF

// Calculate target flow for reactant B
Flow_B_SP := Flow_A_PV / Ratio_Setpoint;

// Check deviation
Error := Actual_Ratio - Ratio_Setpoint;

// Optional: Take action if Error exceeds tolerance
// (e.g., raise an alarm, adjust valves, etc.)

// Flow_B_SP can be sent to a PID loop or analog output to control pump B

In chemical processes, maintaining the correct mixing ratio of reactants is crucial for producing high-quality products. For example, in the production of a chemical compound, the mixing ratio of two reactants must be precisely controlled to ensure the desired chemical composition. Deviations from the target ratio can lead to off-spec products, waste, or even hazardous reactions.

Implementing ratio control in industrial processes can be challenging due to the dynamic nature of the mixing process and the need to handle disturbances such as pump variations or flow rate fluctuations.
