To develop a model predictive control system for optimizing turbine operation in a thermal power plant, we need to consider the following:

1.	Thermal Dynamics: Model the turbineâ€™s thermal behavior, including heat transfer, pressure, and temperature dynamics. Define constraints for maximum allowable pressure, temperature, and ramp rates.
