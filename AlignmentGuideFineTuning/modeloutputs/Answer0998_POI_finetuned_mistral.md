### Intent:
**Intent Summary:**  
Create a textual Process Flow Diagram (PFD) for penicillin fermentation, detailing unit operations, instrumentation tags (e.g., TT101), and control loops (e.g., temperature/pH regulation) in a structured format to guide process and automation teams.  

*(Focus: Documentation-ready PFD with control logic, using arrows/indentation for clarity.)*

### Prompt:
**PFD Penicillin Fermentation:**

Create a Process Flow Diagram (PFD) in textual notation for a fermentation process to produce penicillin. Include instrumentation and control philosophy.


**T-A-G:**

ðŸŸ¥ T (Task)

Develop a text-based Process Flow Diagram (PFD) for a penicillin fermentation process, suitable for engineering documentation and control design.

â¸»

ðŸŸ© A (Action)
	â€¢	List the major unit operations in sequential order, such as:
Water Tank --> Nutrient Mixer --> Sterilizer --> Fermenter --> Separator --> Product Tank
	â€¢	For each unit, add associated instrumentation using standard tag formats (e.g., TT101, pH201, FIC301).
	â€¢	Describe basic control loops, such as:
	â€¢	Temperature control using: TT201 â†’ TIC201 â†’ TCV201
	â€¢	pH adjustment via: pH202 â†’ PIC202 â†’ Base Pump
	â€¢	Format the diagram in clear plain text, using arrows (-->) to indicate material flow and indentations for instrumentation and control strategies.

â¸»

ðŸŸ¦ G (Goal)

Produce a clear, structured, and implementation-ready textual PFD that outlines both the process flow and the control philosophy for penicillin fermentation. This format should help cross-disciplinary teamsâ€”from process design to automationâ€”understand the flow and control logic without needing graphical tools.

### Penicillin Fermentation Process Flow Diagram (PFD)

#### Textual Notation

This PFD is presented in textual notation, using arrows (-->) to represent material flow and indentation to show instrumentation and control loops.

#### Process Overview

The process begins with the preparation of sterilized media, followed by inoculation with penicillin-producing microorganisms. The fermentation process takes place in a sterile environment, where the microorganisms convert precursor molecules into penicillin. The fermented broth is then separated to extract the penicillin, which is purified and packaged for distribution.

#### Detailed Flow Description

1. **Water Tank**
   - Feeds sterilized water to the Nutrient Mixer.
   - Instrumentation:
     - Level Transmitter: LT101
     - Flow Transmitter: FT102
     - Temperature Transmitter: TT103

2. **Nutrient Mixer**
   - Mixes water with nutrients (e.g., glucose, yeast extract, minerals).
   - Instrumentation:
     - Level Transmitter: LT104
     - Flow Transmitter: FT105
     - pH Transmitter: pH106

3. **Sterilizer**
   - Sterilizes the mixed media using steam or radiation.
   - Instrumentation:
     - Pressure Transmitter: PT107
     - Temperature Transmitter: TT108
     - Steam Flow Transmitter: FT109

4. **Fermenter**
   - Contains the penicillin-producing microorganisms.
   - Instrumentation:
     - Level Transmitter: LT110
     - pH Transmitter: pH111
     - Temperature Transmitter: TT112
     - Agitation Speed Transmitter: FT113
     - Pressure Transmitter: PT114
     - Flow Transmitter: FT115
     - Inoculation Level Transmitter: LT
