### Intent:
**Intent Summary:**  
Develop an IEC 61131-3 Structured Text program to implement feedforward control for dynamically adjusting Reactant A's flow rate based on Reactant B's flow and optional properties (e.g., concentration, temperature), ensuring real-time optimal mixing ratios while reducing reliance on feedback loops.  

*(Focus: Predictive flow adjustment, disturbance compensation, and industrial PLC deployment.)*

### Prompt:
**Feedforward Control Mixing:**

Develop a self-contained IEC 61131-3 Structured Text program (not a function block) to implement feedforward control for mixing two reactants in a chemical process. The program should predict the necessary adjustments to the flow rates of each reactant based on known disturbances or input changes, ensuring optimal mixing conditions.

Include logic that calculates the required feedforward adjustments based on process variables such as flow rates, concentration, and temperature, and ensure the control system can respond quickly to input changes without relying solely on feedback. Discuss the advantages of using feedforward control in mixing processes, particularly in terms of improving response time and reducing process variability compared to traditional feedback control.

	1.	Read sensor inputs for:
	â€¢	Flow_B â€“ the measured flow rate of Reactant B

**Mixing Process Feedforward Control:**

Feedforward control is a powerful technique for optimizing chemical mixing processes. By predicting and pre-adjusting the flow rate of Reactant A based on the measured flow rate of Reactant B, feedforward control can improve response time and reduce reliance on slow feedback loops.

In a chemical mixing process, feedforward control anticipates changes in the process before they occur, allowing for proactive adjustments. This proactive approach ensures that the mixing ratio remains stable, even under disturbances such as changes in concentration or temperature.
