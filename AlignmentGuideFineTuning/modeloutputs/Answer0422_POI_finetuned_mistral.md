### Intent:
The task involves implementing a fuzzy logic control system in Python to optimize a chemical reactor's operation by managing temperature, pressure, and reaction rate under nonlinear and uncertain conditions, demonstrating its robustness against traditional PID control.  

(Intent: Develop Python-based fuzzy logic control for chemical reactor optimization with real-time adaptability.)

### Prompt:
**Fuzzy Logic Control for Chemical Reactor Optimization Using Python:**

Develop Python code to implement a fuzzy logic control system for optimizing the operation of a chemical reactor. The control system should manage key reactor variables such as temperature, pressure, and reaction rate, considering the nonlinear and uncertain nature of the reactorâ€™s dynamics. Fuzzy logic should be applied to handle imprecise inputs and adjust control actions in real-time to maintain optimal reactor performance under varying operating conditions.

Implement Python code to simulate the chemical reactorâ€™s dynamics, demonstrating how fuzzy logic control can provide robust and adaptive responses to system uncertainties and process variations.
