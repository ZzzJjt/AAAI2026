### Intent:
**Intent Summary:**  
Create an IEC 61131-3 Structured Text function block to iteratively perform heapsort on an integer array without recursion or `DOWNTO` loops, ensuring in-place sorting and PLC compatibility for automation tasks like prioritization or sensor data ordering.

### Prompt:
**Heapsort:**
Implement a self-contained function block in IEC 61131-3 structured text to perform the heapsort algorithm on an array of integers without using recursion or the â€˜DOWNTOâ€™ keyword in loops. Ensure efficient heap construction and sorting.


**C-A-R-E:**

ðŸŸ¥ C (Context) â€“ Background Situation

Sorting is a critical operation in automation systems where arrays of sensor values, priorities, or process states must be ordered efficiently. Heapsort is a reliable, in-place algorithm with a consistent time complexity of O(n log n), making it ideal for PLC environments. However, in IEC 61131-3 Structured Text, recursion and the DOWNTO keyword are often unsupported or discouraged, requiring a fully iterative approach suitable for scan-cycle-based systems.

ðŸŸ© A (Action) â€“ Task to Perform

Develop a self-contained function block in Structured Text to perform heapsort on an array of integers. The block must:
	â€¢	Use only iterative loops (i.e., no recursion)
	â€¢	Avoid the DOWNTO keyword (use ascending index logic where needed)
	â€¢	Construct a max heap iteratively
	â€¢	Sort the array in-place for memory efficiency
	â€¢	Be modular and include clear input/output definitions and internal heapify routines

â¸»

ðŸŸ¨ R (Result) â€“ Expected Outcome

The result should be a robust and scan-cycle-compatible function block capable of sorting an integer array within IEC 61131-3-compliant systems. It should:
	â€¢	Efficiently order values using heapsort
	â€¢	Maintain code readability and modularity
	â€¢	Be deployable across a variety of automation tasks (e.g., event ranking, control prioritization)
	â€¢	Avoid unsupported language features while delivering deterministic execution time

â¸»

ðŸŸ¦ E (Example) â€“ Concrete Illustration

Sample heapify logic (non-recursive):

FOR I := HeapSize / 2 TO 1 BY -1 DO
   CALL Heapify(InputArray, I, HeapSize);
END_FOR;

Instead of DOWNTO, this loop could be transformed using ascending logic and index math (e.g., FOR I := 1 TO HeapSize / 2 DO with adjusted indexing logic inside the Heapify).

The final function block might include:
	â€¢	InputArray : ARRAY[1..N] OF INT
	â€¢	SortedArray : ARRAY[1..N] OF INT
	â€¢	Execute : BOOL
	â€¢	Done : BOOL

Sample heapify logic (non-recursive):

FOR I := HeapSize / 2 TO 1 BY -1 DO
   CALL Heapify(InputArray, I, HeapSize);
END_FOR;

Instead of DOWNTO, this loop could be transformed using ascending logic and index math (e.g., FOR I := 1 TO HeapSize / 2 DO with adjusted indexing logic inside the Heapify).

	â€¢	InputArray : ARRAY[1..N] OF INT
	â€¢	SortedArray : ARRAY[1..N] OF INT
	â€¢	Execute : BOOL
	â€¢	Done : BOOL

Where Execute triggers the sorting process, and Done indicates when the sorting is complete.

**Note:** The solution should be self-contained, including all necessary Structured Text code for the function block, and should be designed to be easily integrated into an IEC 61131-3 compliant PLC program. ```structuredtext
