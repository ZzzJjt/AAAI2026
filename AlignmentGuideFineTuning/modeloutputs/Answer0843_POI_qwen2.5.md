### Intent:
**Intent Summary:**  
Design a text-based P&I diagram and implement IEC 61131-3 Structured Text interlocks for a distillation column, including safety logic (e.g., pressure/temperature limits) to ensure safe operation and process stability.  

*(Focus: Automation of safety interlocks for critical parameters in a distillation process.)*

### Prompt:
**Interlock Distillation Column:**

Develop a P&I diagram in textual notation for a distillation column, detailing the process equipment, instrumentation, control functions, safety interlocks, and piping. Use typical tagnames to represent elements such as the column (C-101), reboiler (E-101), condenser (E-102), level transmitters (LT-101), pressure transmitters (PT-101), and control valves (FV-101). Ensure the notation includes both the control functions and the safety interlocks, specifying their interactions with the piping and instrumentation system.

Following this, write a self-contained IEC 61131-3 Structured Text program to implement the interlocks of the distillation column. Include high and low limits for critical parameters such as pressure, temperature, and liquid level. For instance, trigger the pressure relief valve if the column pressure exceeds 120 psi (high limit) or shut off the feed valve if the pressure drops below 50 psi (low limit). Similarly, close the reboiler heat supply if the temperature exceeds 180Â°C. Discuss the role of interlocks in maintaining safe operating conditions within the distillation process.

ðŸŸ© A (Action) â€“ How to Do It
	1.	Create a P&I diagram in textual notation showing the key components:
	â€¢	C-101 (distillation column)
	â€¢	E-101 (reboiler), E-102 (condenser)
	â€¢	Instrumentation: PT-101 (pressure), TT-101 (temperature), LT-101 (level)
	â€¢	Actuators: FV-101 (feed valve), PRV-101 (pressure relief valve)
Include both control functions (e.g., controlling temperature using reboiler) and safety interlocks (e.g., stopping the feed pump if pressure is too low).
	2.	Develop a Structured Text (ST) program to implement interlocks with logic such as:
	â€¢	If PT-101 > 120 psi, activate PRV-101
	â€¢	If PT-101 < 50 psi, close FV-101
	â€¢	If TT-101 > 180Â°C, shut off heat supply to E-101
	3.	Write an explanation of how each interlock improves safety and process stability, describing how it prevents conditions like overpressure, underheating, or flooding.

PROGRAM DistillationColumnInterlocks
VAR
    PT_101 : REAL; // Pressure Transmitter 101
    TT_101 : REAL; // Temperature Transmitter 101
    LT_101 : REAL; // Level Transmitter 101

    PRV_101 := 1; // Activate Pressure Relief Valve
ELSEIF PT_101 < 50 THEN
    FV_101 := 0; // Close Feed Valve
END_IF;

IF TT_101 > 180 THEN
    // Shut off heat supply to E-101
    // This could be a signal to a valve or a controller
    // For simplicity, we'll assume it's a signal to a controller
    // that controls the heat supply
    // Example: HeatSupplyController := 0;
END_IF;
```

**Explanation of Interlocks:**

1. **Pressure Relief Valve (PRV-101):**
   - **High Pressure Interlock:** If the pressure in the distillation column (PT-101) exceeds 120 psi, the pressure relief valve (PRV-101) is activated. This prevents overpressure conditions that could lead to equipment failure or safety hazards.
   - **Low Pressure Interlock
