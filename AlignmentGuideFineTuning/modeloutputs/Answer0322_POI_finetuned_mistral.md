🟥 C (Context) – Why It Matters

In industrial automation, PID (Proportional–Integral–Derivative) control is one of the most widely used strategies for maintaining setpoints like temperature, pressure, and flow. The OSCAT library provides a standardized and reusable PID function block that can be integrated into PLC programs for real-time process control. Understanding the function block’s inputs, outputs, and behavior is essential for effective implementation.

🟩 A (Action) – What to Explain

Provide a comprehensive explanation of the PID function block in the OSCAT library, covering:
	•	Inputs:
	•	PV (Process Variable): the measured value to be controlled
	•	SP (Setpoint): the desired target value
	•	Kp, Ki, Kd: proportional, integral, and derivative tuning parameters
	•	MANUAL, AUTO, and output limits, if applicable
	•	Internal Behavior:
	•	Calculates error: Error := SP - PV
	•	Computes control signal based on PID formula
	•	Applies clamping to restrict the control signal to safe ranges
	•	Handles manual override logic if supported
	•	Outputs:
	•	OUT: the control output to an actuator (e.g. valve, motor)
	•	ERROR: the real-time error value
	•	Optional flags (e.g. saturation, limit reached)

⸻

🟨 R (Result) – What It Enables

Understanding and properly configuring the OSCAT PID function block allows engineers to:
	•	Achieve stable, responsive control in a wide range of dynamic industrial processes
	•	Reduce overshoot and steady-state error using the appropriate tuning of Kp, Ki, and Kd
	•	Integrate automation logic into systems that need continuous adjustment to maintain quality and safety
	•	Simplify code reuse and speed up commissioning by leveraging a standardized and field-tested control block

🟦 E (Example) – Real-World Use Case

In a water treatment plant, a PID block can be used to control the chlorine dosing pump:
// Inputs
SP := 3.0; // Desired chlorine concentration (ppm)
PV := MeasuredChlorine(); // Real-time sensor input
Kp := 1.2;
Ki := 0.5;
Kd := 0.0;

// Output
OUT := PID(SP, PV, Kp, Ki, Kd); // Dosing rate output
The OUT value is used to control the speed of a pump that adds chlorine to the water stream. If the actual concentration drops below 3 ppm, the PID will increase the output accordingly.
