**C**ontext:

Model predictive control (MPC) is a widely used control strategy for optimizing dynamic systems, such as robots, in real-time. MPC algorithms predict the future behavior of the system based on a mathematical model and optimize the control inputs to achieve specific performance objectives, like smooth motion, obstacle avoidance, and dynamic constraints.

In the context of robotics, MPC can be used to optimize motion planning and control, ensuring that the robot moves smoothly and efficiently while avoiding obstacles and adhering to dynamic constraints. This approach is particularly useful in dynamic environments where the robot must adapt to changing conditions and obstacles in real-time.
