### Intent:
**Intent Summary:**  
Develop a MATLAB-based Model Predictive Control (MPC) system to optimize aircraft trajectory while enforcing dynamic constraints, fuel efficiency, and adaptive disturbance rejection for flight safety.  

*(Focus: Trajectory optimization via MPC with MATLAB, prioritizing constraints, efficiency, and robustness.)*

### Prompt:
**Model Predictive Control for Aircraft Trajectory Using MATLAB:**

Develop MATLAB code to implement a model predictive control (MPC) algorithm for optimizing the trajectory of an aircraft. Ensure that the control scheme accounts for dynamic constraints, fuel efficiency, and external disturbances, while maintaining flight safety and performance objectives.

**R-I-S-E:**

ðŸŸ¥ Rï¼ˆRoleï¼‰

Act as an aerospace control systems engineer specializing in trajectory optimization and predictive control using MATLAB.

ðŸŸ© Iï¼ˆInputï¼‰

You are tasked with developing a control system for aircraft trajectory optimization. The system must account for dynamic constraints, fuel efficiency, external disturbances (e.g., wind), and ensure compliance with safety and performance requirements. MATLAB will be used for both modeling and implementation.

ðŸŸ§ Sï¼ˆStepsï¼‰
	1.	Model the aircraftâ€™s dynamics in MATLAB, incorporating variables such as position, velocity, control inputs, and external forces.
	2.	Formulate a model predictive control (MPC) scheme that includes constraints on system behavior and objectives related to fuel efficiency and flight safety.
	3.	Implement the MPC algorithm and simulate various flight scenarios with disturbances.
	4.	Evaluate the systemâ€™s ability to maintain optimal trajectory under different operational conditions.

ðŸŸ¦ Eï¼ˆExpectationï¼‰

The resulting MATLAB system should demonstrate that the MPC algorithm can optimize aircraft trajectory while respecting constraints and reacting adaptively to disturbancesâ€”enhancing fuel efficiency and maintaining flight safety.
