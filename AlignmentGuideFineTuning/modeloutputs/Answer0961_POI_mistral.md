### Intent:
The task requires implementing a binary search function block in IEC 61131-3 Structured Text to efficiently find a target value in a sorted 100-element integer array for PLC applications, with input validation and clear documentation.

### Prompt:
**Binary Search:**
Implement a self-contained function block in IEC 61131-3 structured text to perform a binary search on an array of 100 integers. Include input validation and efficient handling of search boundaries.

**T-A-G:**

ðŸŸ¥ T (Task)

Implement a binary search function block in IEC 61131-3 Structured Text to efficiently locate a target value in a 100-element sorted integer array.

â¸»

ðŸŸ© A (Action)
	â€¢	Define a self-contained function block that accepts:
	â€¢	SearchArray : ARRAY[1..100] OF INT
	â€¢	TargetValue : INT
	â€¢	Enable : BOOL
	â€¢	Use internal variables for Low, High, Mid, and status flags.
	â€¢	Implement the binary search algorithm using a WHILE loop or equivalent, ensuring efficient narrowing of the search window.
	â€¢	Add input validation to ensure boundary safety and proper triggering.
	â€¢	Output the index of the target value and a boolean flag indicating whether it was found.
	â€¢	Include comments explaining each step of the logic for maintainability and clarity.

ðŸŸ¦ G (Goal)

Deliver a modular, efficient, and scan-cycle-safe Structured Text function block that enables fast data lookup on PLCs. The function should be reliable, easy to reuse, and support safe operation within industrial real-time control systems.

Deliver a modular, efficient, and scan-cycle-safe Structured Text function block that enables fast data lookup on PLCs. The function should be reliable, easy to reuse, and support safe operation within industrial real-time control systems.

**Function Block:**

```
PROGRAM BinarySearch;

VAR
  SearchArray : ARRAY[1..100] OF INT;
  TargetValue : INT;
  Enable : BOOL;
  Low, High, Mid : INT;
  Found : BOOL;

FUNCTION BinarySearch : BOOL;
BEGIN
  IF NOT Enable THEN
    Found := FALSE;
    EXIT;
  END_IF;

  Low := 1;
  High := 100;

  WHILE Low <= High DO
    Mid := (Low + High) DIV 2;

    IF SearchArray[Mid] = TargetValue THEN
      Found := TRUE;
      EXIT;
    END_IF;

    IF SearchArray[Mid] < TargetValue THEN
      Low := Mid + 1;
    ELSE
      High := Mid - 1;
    END_IF;
  END_WHILE;

  Found := (Low <= High) AND (SearchArray[Mid] <> TargetValue);

  IF NOT Found THEN
    Index := 0;
  ELSE
    Index := Mid;
  END_IF;

  BinarySearch := Found;
END_FUNCTION;

END_PROGRAM;

**Usage Example:**

```
PROGRAM Main;

VAR
  SearchArray : ARRAY[1..100] OF INT;
  TargetValue : INT;
  Enable : BOOL;
  Index : INT;
  Found : BOOL;

BEGIN
  SearchArray := [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 3
