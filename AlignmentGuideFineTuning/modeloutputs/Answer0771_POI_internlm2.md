### Intent:
**Intent Summary:**  
Design a structured start-up and shutdown sequence in IEC 61131-3 Structured Text for a 3D pouch making machine, ensuring sequential activation/deactivation of heating/cooling stations, tension control via feeders, cutter synchronization, and safe parameterized procedures with timers and conditions.  

*(Focus: Machine sequencing, tension management, safety, and synchronization in packaging automation.)*

### Prompt:
**3D Pouch Making Machine:**

Design a detailed start-up and shutdown sequence for a 3D pouch making machine in IEC 61131-3 Structured Text. The machine consists of 8 heating stations, 8 cooling stations, one horizontal cutter, one vertical cutter, and two feeder units responsible for raw material feeding. Winding tension management is critical throughout the process to ensure proper tension in the raw material.

Write a structured start-up sequence that sequentially activates the heating and cooling stations, regulates the feeder units to maintain optimal tension, and ensures proper synchronization between the cutters and material flow. Additionally, create a shutdown sequence that safely deactivates each component in the correct order, ensuring proper cooling and tension release.

Ensure the program includes typical parameter values, timers, and conditions for each stage of the start-up and shutdown procedures, and discuss the importance of winding tension in maintaining machine efficiency and product quality.

**Additional Considerations:**

1. **Winding Tension Management:** Winding tension is critical for maintaining product quality and machine efficiency. Ensure your program includes proper tension control mechanisms, such as adjustable speed drives for the feeder units, and that these mechanisms are properly synchronized with the heating and cooling stations.

2. **Safety:** Implement safety measures in your program to prevent accidents and ensure proper operation. This may include emergency stop buttons, interlocks, and safety relays to prevent operation when a safety condition is not met.

3. **Maintenance:** Consider the need for regular maintenance and calibration of the machine. Your program should include provisions for setting and resetting parameters, as well as for monitoring and logging important data for maintenance purposes.

4. **Scalability:** Design your program with scalability in mind. As the machine evolves and additional components are added, your program should be able to accommodate these changes without significant modifications.

5. **Documentation:** Provide clear and concise documentation for your program, including a description of each component, its function, and its interaction with other components. This documentation should be easily accessible to other engineers and technicians who may need to work with or modify the program.

**Deliverables:**

1. **IEC 61131-3 Structured Text Program:** A complete program that implements the start-up and shutdown sequence as described in the task.
2. **Documentation:** A detailed description of the program, including a breakdown of each component, its function, and its interaction with other components.
3. **Parameter Values:** A list of parameter values used in the program, along with a brief explanation of their purpose and typical operating ranges.
4. **Test Plan:** A plan for testing the program, including test cases, expected results, and any necessary safety precautions.

**Deadline:** 14 days from the start of the project.

**Budget:** $500

**Additional Notes:**

- The program should be written in IEC 61131-3 Structured Text, which is a widely used programming language for industrial automation.
- The program should be designed to run on a PLC (Programmable
