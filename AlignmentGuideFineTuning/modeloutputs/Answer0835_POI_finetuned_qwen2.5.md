### Intent:
**Intent Summary:**  
Develop an IEC 61131-3 Structured Text function block to reliably read five process values from an IO-Link master, with error handling and status reporting for robust communication.  

**Key Focus:**  
- IO-Link data acquisition  
- Error/status management  
- Real-time diagnostics  
- Structured Text (ST) compliance

### Prompt:
**IO-Link Data Acquisition Using 61131-3 Structured Text:**

Develop a function block in structured text (ST) based on IEC 61131 standards to read five values from a remote IO-Link master. The function block should handle communication with the IO-Link master, retrieve the required process data, and provide the status of each read operation. Discuss the methodology used for error checking, status reporting, and handling of potential communication issues between the IO-Link master and the connected devices.

**T-A-G:**

ðŸŸ¥ T (Task) â€“ What You Need to Do

Develop an IEC 61131-3 Structured Text (ST) function block to acquire five process values from a remote IO-Link master device.

ðŸŸ© A (Action) â€“ How to Do It

Implement logic to establish and manage communication with the IO-Link master. Sequentially or concurrently read five data points, verify the integrity of each response, and return both the values and their respective status indicators. Integrate error detection and reporting mechanisms to handle communication issues, such as timeouts or data corruption.

ðŸŸ¦ G (Goal) â€“ What You Want to Achieve

Ensure accurate and reliable acquisition of IO-Link data, with clear status feedback for each value, enabling the controller to act on real-time diagnostics and maintain robust system behavior even in the presence of communication faults.

**R-I-S-E:**

ðŸŸ¥ R (Role) â€“ Your Role

You are a PLC programmer or automation engineer responsible for implementing reliable communication with IO-Link devices using IEC 61131 standards.

ðŸŸ© I (Input) â€“ What Youâ€™re Given

You are tasked with developing a function block in structured text (ST) to read five process values from an IO-Link master device. The IO-Link master communicates with sensors and actuators, and your function block must ensure that all five values are accurately read and relayed to the controller.

ðŸŸ¦ S (Steps) â€“ How to Do It

	1.	Define the function block inputs: five process data references and an output buffer to store the read values along with their status.
	2.	Implement the communication protocol to establish a connection with the IO-Link master.
	3.	Develop a loop or sequence to read each of the five process values from the IO-Link master, ensuring proper timing and error handling.
	4.	For each read operation, check the status of the communication and the validity of the data received.
	5.	Encode the status of each read operation (e.g., success, timeout, error) into the output buffer.
	6.	Provide detailed comments in the ST code to explain the logic and error handling mechanisms.

ðŸŸ© E (Example) â€“ What It Should Look Like

	â€¢	Inputs:
	â€¢	ProcessValue1 : REAL
	â€¢	ProcessValue2 : REAL
	â€¢	ProcessValue3 : REAL
	â€¢	ProcessValue4 : REAL
	â€¢	ProcessValue5 : REAL
	â€¢	Output : ARRAY[1..5] OF REAL
	â€¢	â€¢	ProcessValue1 : REAL
	â€¢	â€¢	ProcessValue2 : REAL
	â€¢	â€¢	ProcessValue3 : REAL
	â€¢	â€¢	ProcessValue4 : REAL

	â€¢	â€¢	â€¢	ProcessValue1 : REAL
	â€¢	â€¢	â€¢	ProcessValue2 : REAL
	â€¢	â€¢	â€¢	ProcessValue3 : REAL
	â€¢	â€¢	â€¢	ProcessValue4 : REAL
	â€¢	â€¢	â€¢	ProcessValue5 : REAL
	â€¢	â€¢	â€¢	â€¢	ProcessValue1 : REAL
	â€¢	â€¢	â€¢	â€¢	ProcessValue2 : REAL
	â€¢	â€¢	â€¢	â€¢
