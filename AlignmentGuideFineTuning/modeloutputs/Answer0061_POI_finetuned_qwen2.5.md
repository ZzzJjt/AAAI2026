ðŸŸ¥ B (Before) â€“ The Challenge

Programmable Logic Controllers (PLCs) are traditionally used for real-time control, not for complex linear algebra. Calculating eigenvalues of large matricesâ€”such as a 10Ã—10 matrixâ€”on a PLC presents significant challenges including limited processing power, memory constraints, and concerns around numerical stability and convergence. Without optimization, such computations can be impractical for real-time industrial systems.

ðŸŸ© A (After) â€“ The Ideal Outcome

Develop a self-contained function block in IEC 61131-3 Structured Text named ComputeEigenvalues_10x10 that:
	â€¢	Accepts a 10x10 matrix as input
	â€¢	Computes its eigenvalues using a numerically stable method (e.g., QR algorithm or power iteration)
	â€¢	Returns the eigenvalues as an array of REALs
	â€¢	Includes clear, detailed comments for each step of the algorithm
	â€¢	Is optimized for execution on resource-constrained PLCs (e.g., with loop unrolling, minimal recursion, convergence thresholding)

Additionally, provide a discussion that highlights:
	â€¢	Challenges with real-time feasibility
	â€¢	Risks of divergence or instability in iterative methods
	â€¢	Techniques for managing precision and performance trade-offs in PLC environments

ðŸŸ§ B (Bridge) â€“ The Implementation Strategy

To build this solution:
	1.	Use fixed-point arithmetic or bounded iteration limits to maintain PLC responsiveness
	2.	Structure the function block with input/output arrays, internal loop counters, and convergence checks
	3.	Choose a lightweight iterative method (e.g., Jacobi or Power Method) for approximation
	4.	Comment each step, for example:
 // Normalize input vector
// Calculate next vector approximation
// Check for convergence: IF ABS(oldVal - newVal) < epsilon THEN ...
	5.	End with a discussion of how this implementation supports engineering education, model-based control applications, or signal analysis tasks where eigenvalue estimation may be needed.

ðŸŸ¥ B (Before) â€“ The Challenge

In industrial automation, real-time control systems often require eigenvalue analysis for tasks such as vibration monitoring, fault detection, or predictive maintenance. However, most PLC platforms lack native matrix math libraries and are constrained by limited processing power, memory, and scan-cycle timing. Calculating eigenvalues of a 10Ã—10 matrix directly on a PLC is impractical due to these limitations, making it difficult to implement advanced control algorithms that rely on eigenvalue computation.
