### Intent:
**Intent Summary:**  
Create an IEC 61131-3 Structured Text function block to monitor and log real-time communication status (OPC UA, Modbus, Profinet), trigger alarms on failures, and record diagnostic details for troubleshooting.  

*(Focus: Protocol-agnostic monitoring, fault logging, and real-time alerting.)*

### Prompt:
**Communication Monitoring for OPC UA, Modbus, and Profinet Using IEC 61131-3 Structured Text:**

Develop a function block in structured text (ST) as per IEC 61131-3 standards to monitor communication connections to an OPC UA server, Modbus server, and Profinet in a machine system. The function block should continuously check the connection status of each protocol, and if any connection fails, an alarm should be triggered. Additionally, when a connection is lost, an entry must be created in the audit trail, detailing the reason for the server being down along with the corresponding error code. Discuss the implementation logic for monitoring multiple protocols, error detection, and how to effectively manage and log communication failures for real-time monitoring and troubleshooting.

**T-A-G:**

ðŸŸ¥ T (Task) â€“ What You Need to Do

Create an IEC 61131-3 Structured Text (ST) function block to monitor communication status for OPC UA, Modbus, and Profinet protocols within a machine control system.

ðŸŸ© A (Action) â€“ How to Do It

Develop logic that continuously checks the connection status of each protocol. If any connection fails, the function block should raise an alarm and generate an audit trail entry containing the protocol name, reason for the failure, and an associated error code. The block should handle each protocol independently and include mechanisms for error detection, alarm handling, and memory-safe logging.

ðŸŸ¦ G (Goal) â€“ What You Aim to Achieve

Ensure robust, real-time communication monitoring and fault diagnostics for all three protocols, enabling operators and maintenance teams to quickly identify, respond to, and trace communication failuresâ€”thus improving system uptime and traceability.

ðŸŸ¦ G (Goal) â€“ What You Aim to Achieve

Ensure robust, real-time communication monitoring and fault diagnostics for all three protocols, enabling operators and maintenance teams to quickly identify, respond to, and trace communication failuresâ€”thus improving system uptime and traceability. The function block should be designed to be easily integrated into existing control systems and should be scalable to accommodate future protocol additions.

**Implementation Logic:**

1. **Protocol-Specific Connection Checks:**
   - For OPC UA, use the OPC UA client library to establish a connection to the server. Implement a loop that periodically checks the connection status. If the connection is lost, raise an alarm and log the failure.
   - For Modbus, use a Modbus client library to connect to the Modbus server. Implement a similar loop to check the connection status and log any failures.
   - For Profinet, use a Profinet client library to connect to the Profinet network. Implement a loop to monitor the connection status and log any issues.

2. **Error Detection and Alarm Handling:**
   - Implement error handling routines for each protocol to detect connection failures. These routines should be able to differentiate between different types of errors (e.g., network issues, server unavailability, protocol-specific errors).
   - When an error is detected, raise an alarm using the appropriate alarm system in the control system. The alarm should include the protocol name, a brief description of the failure, and the error code.

3. **Audit Trail Logging:**
   - Create a data structure to store audit trail entries. Each entry should include the protocol name, the reason for the failure, and the error code.
   - When a connection failure is detected, add a new entry to the audit trail data structure. This entry should be timestamped to provide a clear record of when the failure occurred.

4. **Memory Management:**
   - Ensure that the function block manages memory safely to prevent memory leaks or other issues that could affect the stability of the control system. This may involve periodically clearing old audit trail entries or using a fixed-size buffer for the audit trail.

5. **Integration and Scalability:**
   - Design the function block to be easily integrated into existing control systems. This may involve providing clear documentation and interfaces for other parts of the system to interact with the function block.
   - Ensure that the function block is scalable to accommodate future protocol additions. This may involve designing the function block to be modular and extensible, allowing new protocols to be added without significant changes to the existing code.
