### Intent:
The task is to develop an IEC 61131-3 Structured Text program for a PLC-controlled coffee machine that manages three tanks (coffee, milk, mixer) and three valves, with safety interlocks, drink selection modes (coffee-only or coffee+milk), and an emergency stop feature to ensure proper mixing and fail-safe operation.

### Prompt:
**Coffee Maker Control Using 61131-3 Structured Text:**

Write a self-contained 61131-3 structured text (ST) program to control a coffee machine that manages three tanks (coffee, milk, and mixer) and three valves (one for coffee, one for milk, and one for output). The machine should mix coffee and milk properly to create the best output, following this process:

System Description:

	1.	Tanks and Valves:
	â€¢	The coffee and milk valves open to fill the mixer tank. The mixer tank can hold up to 130ml, and when it reaches the maximum level, the coffee and milk valves will close.
	2.	Mixing Process:
	â€¢	Once the tank is full, the mixer starts automatically and runs for 4 seconds. After mixing is complete, the output valve opens to dispense the coffee.
	3.	Control Buttons:
	â€¢	Button 1: Emergency Stop â€” Stops the entire system instantly in case of malfunction, such as valve failures, tank level issues, or mixer failures.
	â€¢	Button 2: Start â€” Begins the coffee-making process.
	â€¢	Button 3: Coffee and Milk â€” Prepares coffee with milk by opening both the coffee and milk valves.
	â€¢	Button 4: Coffee Only â€” Prepares coffee without milk by only opening the coffee valve.

Safety Features:

	â€¢	Implement the emergency stop to handle unexpected events, such as valve malfunctions, tank level detection failures, or mixer operation failures. When triggered, the system should stop immediately to ensure safety.

**B-A-B:**

ðŸŸ¥ B (Before) â€“ The Challenge

Controlling a coffee machine with multiple tanks, valves, and safety requirements involves precise timing, state transitions, and interlock logic. Without proper automation, the process may result in overflow, improper mixing, or unsafe conditions due to valve or sensor malfunctions. Many systems lack a reliable emergency stop mechanism and donâ€™t distinguish between different drink modes (coffee only vs. coffee with milk), making them rigid, error-prone, and unsafe.

ðŸŸ© A (After) â€“ The Ideal Outcome

Develop a self-contained PLC program using IEC 61131-3 Structured Text that:
	â€¢	Manages three tanks:
	â€¢	Coffee Tank
	â€¢	Milk Tank
	â€¢	Mixer Tank (max 130 ml)
	â€¢	Controls three valves:
	â€¢	Coffee Valve
	â€¢	Milk Valve
	â€¢	Output Valve
	â€¢	Implements four push-button operations:
	â€¢	Button 1 (Emergency Stop) â€” halts all processes immediately
	â€¢	Button 2 (Start) â€” begins the brewing process
	â€¢	Button 3 (Coffee + Milk) â€” opens both coffee and milk valves
	â€¢	Button 4 (Coffee Only) â€” opens only the coffee valve
	â€¢	Executes the mixing process:
	â€¢	Once the mixer tank reaches 130 ml, valves close
	â€¢	Mixer runs for 4 seconds
	â€¢	After mixing, the output valve opens to dispense
	â€¢	Ensures safety through logic interlocks:
	â€¢	The Emergency Stop overrides all functions
	â€¢	Failsafe conditions prevent continued operation if level detection or mixer fails

ðŸŸ§ B (Bridge) â€“ The Implementation Strategy

To build this logic:
	1.	Declare inputs/outputs:
	â€¢	Inputs: StartButton, CoffeeMilkButton, CoffeeOnlyButton, EmergencyStop, MixerLevelFull, MixerFault
	â€¢	Outputs: CoffeeValve, MilkValve, OutputValve, Mixer
	2.	State-based control:
	â€¢	Filling: Open appropriate valves until MixerLevelFull = TRUE
	â€¢	Mixing: Close valves and run Mixer for 4 seconds (with a TON timer)
	â€¢	Dispensing: Open OutputValve
	â€¢	Emergency Stop: All outputs = FALSE, mixer and valves stopped
	3.	Use safety logic:
 IF EmergencyStop THEN
    CoffeeValve := FALSE;
    MilkValve := FALSE;
    Mixer := FALSE;
    OutputValve := FALSE;
ELSE
    CASE State OF
        0: // Idle
            IF StartButton THEN
                IF CoffeeMilkButton THEN
                    CoffeeValve := TRUE;
                    MilkValve := TRUE;
                    State := 1;
                ELSIF CoffeeOnlyButton THEN
                    CoffeeValve := TRUE;
                    MilkValve := FALSE;
                    State := 1;
                END_IF;
            END_IF;
        1: // Filling
            IF MixerLevelFull THEN
                CoffeeValve := FALSE;
                MilkValve := FALSE;
                Mixer := TRUE;
                Timer(IN:=TRUE, PT:=T#4s);
                State := 2;
            END_IF;
        2: // Mixing
            IF Timer.Q THEN
                Mixer := FALSE;
                OutputValve := TRUE;
                State := 3;
            END_IF;
        3: // Dispensing
            // Optionally return to Idle after X seconds
    END_CASE;
END_IF;
	4.	Comment and modularize the logic for each step to ensure clarity and ease of maintenance

ðŸŸ¥ B (Before) â€“ The Challenge

Controlling a coffee machine with three tanks, three valves, and safety interlocks using IEC 61131-3 Structured Text requires a detailed and modular program. Without a structured and well-documented approach, itâ€™s difficult to manage the logic for tank filling, valve control, mixing, and emergency stops. Many implementations lack clear state transitions, safety checks, and fail-safe conditions, making the system prone to errors and unsafe operation.
