### Intent:
The task involves converting a **PickAndPlace** control sequence from **Structured Text (ST)** to **Instruction List (IL)** while preserving logic for mode switching, event-driven execution, and distributed signal handling in industrial automation.  

**Intent Summary:**  
*Generate equivalent IL code for a PickAndPlace controller with manual/auto modes, timed operations, and conveyor/arm coordination, translated from an ST reference implementation.*

### Prompt:
**Learning IEC 61499:**
Provide a concise introduction to the IEC 61499 programming language, emphasizing key concepts for someone already familiar with IEC 61131-3. Include a comparison of their fundamental differences in terms of architecture, execution models, and flexibility for distributed control systems. Additionally, compile a list of five key references for further reading on IEC 61499, highlighting its relevance in modern industrial applications.

**C-A-R-E:**

üü• C (Context) ‚Äì Background

You are already knowledgeable in IEC 61131-3, the widely used standard for PLC programming in industrial automation. However, with the growing need for modular, event-driven, and distributed control systems, there‚Äôs increasing relevance for understanding IEC 61499, a newer standard that addresses these needs with a different architectural philosophy.

	2.	Provide a comparative summary of IEC 61499 and IEC 61131-3 focusing on:
	‚Ä¢	Control architecture
	‚Ä¢	Execution model (event-driven vs. scan-based)
	‚Ä¢	Support for distributed automation
	3.	Highlight the advantages and flexibility IEC 61499 offers for modern industrial systems.
	4.	Compile five authoritative references for further learning.
