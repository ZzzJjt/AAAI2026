### Intent:
**Intent Summary:**  
Develop an IEC 61131-3 Structured Text function block to monitor OPC UA, Modbus, and Profinet connections, trigger alarms on failures, and log detailed error entries (protocol, reason, code, timestamp) for real-time diagnostics and troubleshooting.

### Prompt:
**Communication Monitoring for OPC UA, Modbus, and Profinet Using IEC 61131-3 Structured Text:**

Develop a function block in structured text (ST) as per IEC 61131-3 standards to monitor communication connections to an OPC UA server, Modbus server, and Profinet in a machine system. The function block should continuously check the connection status of each protocol, and if any connection fails, an alarm should be triggered. Additionally, when a connection is lost, an entry must be created in the audit trail, detailing the reason for the server being down along with the corresponding error code. Discuss the implementation logic for monitoring multiple protocols, error detection, and how to effectively manage and log communication failures for real-time monitoring and troubleshooting.

**C-A-R-E:**

üü• C (Context) ‚Äì The Background

Modern industrial machine systems rely on seamless communication with multiple protocols such as OPC UA, Modbus, and Profinet. Failures in any of these connections can lead to critical system issues, production delays, and increased maintenance costs‚Äîespecially if the system lacks real-time monitoring and diagnostic capabilities.

üü© A (Action) ‚Äì The Implementation Task

Develop a function block in IEC 61131-3 Structured Text (ST) to continuously monitor the connection status of OPC UA, Modbus, and Profinet protocols. The function block should trigger an alarm when a connection fails and log an entry in the audit trail including the protocol, failure reason, and associated error code. The implementation should handle multiple protocol types concurrently, detect specific communication failures, and ensure all events are logged for traceability.

üü® R (Result) ‚Äì The Expected Outcome

The function block enables real-time communication diagnostics and traceable logging for all monitored protocols. Operators can respond immediately to failures, and maintenance personnel have access to precise, timestamped fault data‚Äîminimizing downtime and improving system reliability.

üü¶ E (Example) ‚Äì A Practical Use Case

For instance, if the OPC UA server becomes unreachable due to a network timeout, the function block will detect the issue, activate a corresponding alarm, and write an audit log entry stating ‚ÄúOPC UA timeout ‚Äì Error Code 0x05‚Äù along with a timestamp. Simultaneously, Modbus and Profinet connections remain monitored without interruption, ensuring complete system visibility.

Ensure the function block can handle multiple protocols concurrently and provide real-time diagnostics for communication failures.

üü® B (Block) ‚Äì The Block You Need to Build

Develop a function block in IEC 61131-3 Structured Text (ST) to monitor OPC UA, Modbus, and Profinet connections, with the following inputs and outputs:

Inputs:
- OPC UA connection status
- Modbus connection status
- Profinet connection status

Outputs:
- OPC UA connection failure alarm
- Modbus connection failure alarm
- Profinet connection failure alarm
- OPC UA connection failure log entry
- Modbus connection failure log entry
- Profinet connection failure log entry

The function block should continuously check the connection status of each protocol and trigger alarms and log entries when a connection fails. The log entries should include the protocol type, failure reason, error code, and timestamp.
