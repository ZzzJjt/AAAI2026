ðŸŸ¨ S (Solution) â€“ How to Solve

1.	Create a function block named NaturalLog:
```IEC
FUNCTION_BLOCK NaturalLog
VAR_INPUT
    X : REAL;
END_VAR
VAR_OUTPUT
    LnX : REAL;
    Error : BOOL;
END_VAR
```
2.	Implement logic for computing the logarithm:
```IEC
IF X > 0 THEN
    LnX := LN(X);
    Error := FALSE;
ELSE
    LnX := 0.0;  // or -9999.0, depending on your application
    Error := TRUE;
END_IF;
```
3.	Comment clearly on:
	â€¢	Why ln(x) is undefined for non-positive values:
The natural logarithm is a mathematical function that is undefined for non-positive inputs. This is because the logarithm of a number is defined as the exponent to which the base must be raised to obtain the number. For example, ln(1) is 0 because 10^0 = 1. However, for negative numbers or zero, there is no such base that, when raised to a certain exponent, would result in the given number. Therefore, the natural logarithm is undefined for non-positive values.
	â€¢	The mathematical relationship between logarithms and exponentials:
The natural logarithm is the inverse function of the exponential function. This means that if y = e^x, then x = ln(y). The exponential function is a continuous, increasing function that maps the real numbers to themselves, while the natural logarithm is its inverse. The relationship between logarithms and exponentials is fundamental in many areas of mathematics and science, including calculus, physics, and engineering.
	â€¢	Real-time implications of using a built-in vs. custom implementation:
Using a built-in function like LN() can be more efficient and less error-prone, as it is optimized for the specific hardware and software environment. However, it may not be available in all cases, and custom implementations can provide more flexibility and control over the precision and behavior of the function. In real-time systems, it is important to balance the need for accuracy with the constraints of computational resources and scan times.
4.	Optimize for execution:
The provided implementation is already optimized for execution, as it uses
