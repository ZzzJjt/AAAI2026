### Intent:
**Intent Summary:**  
Create an IEC 61131-3 structured text function block to perform iterative quicksort on integer arrays in PLCs, avoiding recursion while ensuring scan-cycle safety, memory efficiency, and modularity for industrial automation sorting tasks.  

*(Focus: Recursion-free quicksort for PLCs with stack emulation, partitioning, and in-place sorting.)*

### Prompt:
**Quicksort:**
Implement a self-contained function block in IEC 61131-3 structured text to perform the quicksort algorithm on an array of integers. Ensure efficient partitioning and recursion handling.

**B-A-B:**

ðŸŸ¥ B (Before) â€“ The Problem or Challenge

In industrial automation tasks such as data sorting, ranking, or prioritizing process values, efficient sorting algorithms are essential. Quicksort is a powerful algorithm known for its average-case efficiency, but it typically relies on recursion, which is either not supported or discouraged in IEC 61131-3 Structured Text environments due to scan-cycle safety and memory limitations. Without a properly adapted approach, implementing quicksort on a PLC could result in stack overflows or unreadable code structures.

ðŸŸ© A (After) â€“ The Desired Outcome

Develop a self-contained function block in IEC 61131-3 Structured Text that performs the quicksort algorithm on an array of integers. The solution must:
	â€¢	Avoid direct recursion by simulating it with iterative control structures and stack emulation using arrays or state machines
	â€¢	Implement an efficient partitioning mechanism
	â€¢	Sort the array in place, preserving memory efficiency
	â€¢	Be modular, reusable, and compliant with scan-cycle-safe programming practices

ðŸŸ§ B (Bridge) â€“ How to Get There
	1.	Define inputs for the function block such as:
	â€¢	InputArray : ARRAY[1..N] OF INT
	â€¢	Execute : BOOL
	2.	Create internal variables to manage sorting state:
	â€¢	Stack emulation using index arrays for Low and High
	â€¢	Pivot, i, j, and temporary variables for swaps
	3.	Use a loop-based simulation of recursive quicksort, pushing and popping subranges to/from an internal stack
	4.	Include an InProgress flag and a Done output to manage multi-scan execution if needed
	5.	Comment clearly on each phase: partitioning, swapping, and range management

ðŸŸ¥ C (Circumstances) â€“ The Situation

In industrial automation, sorting and ranking of data is a common task. Quicksort is a popular sorting algorithm due to its average-case efficiency. However, in IEC 61131-3 Structured Text, recursion is not supported or discouraged due to scan-cycle safety and memory limitations. Implementing quicksort in PLCs without proper adaptation can lead to stack overflows or unreadable code structures.

To implement quicksort in IEC 61131-3 Structured Text without recursion, follow these steps:

1.	Define inputs for the function block, including an array of integers and an execute flag.
2.	Create internal variables to manage sorting state, such as stack emulation using index arrays for low and high indices, a pivot index, and temporary variables for swapping elements.
3.	Use a loop-based simulation of recursive quicksort, pushing and popping subranges to/from the internal stack.
4.	Include an in-progress flag and a done output to manage multi-scan execution if needed.
5.	Comment each phase of the algorithm, including partitioning, swapping, and range management.
6.	Ensure the function block is modular, with clear input/output definitions and self-contained logic.
