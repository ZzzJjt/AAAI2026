ðŸŸ¥ T (Task) â€“ What You Need to Do

Create a self-contained function block in IEC 61131-3 Structured Text that performs linear interpolation between two known data points.

â¸»

ðŸŸ© A (Action) â€“ How to Do It
	1.	Define a function block named LinearInterpolation with the following REAL inputs:
	â€¢	X1, Y1: First known point
	â€¢	X2, Y2: Second known point
	â€¢	X: The value at which interpolation should occur
	2.	Compute the interpolated output Y using the formula:
Y := Y1 + \frac{(X - X1) \times (Y2 - Y1)}{(X2 - X1)}
Add a conditional check to avoid division by zero:
IF X2 <> X1 THEN
    Y := Y1 + ((X - X1) * (Y2 - Y1)) / (X2 - X1);
ELSE
    Y := Y1; // Or use fallback logic
END_IF;
3.	Include inline comments that explain each part of the calculation.
	4.	Address floating-point rounding and real-time scan cycle constraints, ensuring the block runs efficiently in control applications.

ðŸŸ¦ G (Goal) â€“ What You Want to Achieve

Provide a reusable, lightweight, and accurate function block for linear interpolation that supports applications like:
	â€¢	Sensor signal scaling
	â€¢	Analog-to-digital conversion mapping
	â€¢	Dynamic setpoint adjustments

The function block must ensure safe, predictable results and be suitable for deployment in real-time PLC environments.

        X1, Y1: REAL; // First known point
        X2, Y2: REAL; // Second known point
        X: REAL; // Value at which interpolation should occur
    END_VAR

    VAR_OUTPUT
        Y: REAL; // Interpolated output
    END_VAR

    // Linear interpolation formula
    IF X2 <> X1 THEN

    // Inline comments for clarity

END_FUNCTION_BLOCK
```

**Additional Considerations:**

1.	Ensure the function block is designed for general use, with detailed comments explaining the mathematical formula behind the interpolation process.
2.	Consider potential rounding errors and numerical stability issues, especially when dealing with large data ranges or high precision requirements.
3.	Optimize the function block for real-time responsiveness, as it will be used in industrial control systems where real-time performance is critical.
4.	Test the function block thoroughly to ensure it provides accurate results and handles edge cases gracefully.
5.	Consider adding additional input parameters to allow for customization, such as a fallback value for when X1 and X2 are equal or a smoothing factor for reducing oscillations in dynamic setpoint adjustments.
6.	Consider implementing a version of the function block that uses integer arithmetic for applications where floating-point precision is not required.
7.	Consider implementing a version of the function block that uses a higher-order polynomial interpolation method for applications where a more accurate interpolation is required.
8.	Consider implementing a version of the function block that supports multiple interpolation points for applications where more complex curves need to be approximated.
9.	Consider implementing a version of the function
