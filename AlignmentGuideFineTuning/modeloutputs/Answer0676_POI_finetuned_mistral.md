Certainly! Below is a detailed control narrative for the feedwater control system in a steam-water cycle of a power plant. This narrative covers the key elements of the feedwater loop, including instrumentation, control logic, and setpoints, to ensure safe and efficient operation.

### Feedwater Control Narrative

#### Overview
The feedwater control system is responsible for maintaining the correct water level in the steam drum and ensuring that the correct amount of feedwater is supplied to the boiler. The system includes a drum level transmitter (LT-101), a feedwater control valve (FCV-101), and a feedwater pump (Pump-101). The control loop uses the drum level as a feedback signal to adjust the feedwater flow rate to maintain a stable drum level.

#### Instrumentation
- **LT-101: Drum Level Transmitter**: Measures the water level in the steam drum. The transmitter output is in percentage (%) of drum capacity.
- **FCV-101: Feedwater Control Valve**: Regulates the flow of feedwater into the boiler. The valve position is adjusted based on the drum level signal.
- **Pump-101: Feedwater Pump**: Provides the necessary pressure to drive feedwater into the boiler. The pump speed is not directly controlled but is adjusted based on the feedwater demand.

#### Control Logic
The feedwater control system operates in a closed-loop manner, using the drum level as a feedback signal to adjust the feedwater flow rate. The control logic is as follows:
1. **Level Sensing**: The drum level transmitter (LT-101) continuously monitors the water level in the steam drum.
2. **Setpoint Calculation**: The control system calculates the desired drum level setpoint based on the boiler operating conditions. A typical setpoint might be 70% of drum capacity.
3. **Feedback Comparison**: The actual drum level (LT-101 output) is compared to the setpoint.
4. **Valve Adjustment**: If the actual level deviates from the setpoint, the feedwater control valve (FCV-101) is adjusted to increase or decrease the feedwater flow.
5. **Stable Operation**: The system maintains
