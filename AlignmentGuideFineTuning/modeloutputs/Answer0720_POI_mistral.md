### Intent:
**Intent Summary:**  
Develop an IEC 61131-3 Structured Text program to retrieve and process 10 predefined Profibus DPV1 diagnostic types (e.g., communication errors, device status) using a CASE statement, with robust error handling and structured output mapping for PLC integration.

### Prompt:
**Profibus DPV1 Diagnostics Using 61131-3 Structured Text:**

Develop a self-contained 61131-3 structured text program to retrieve diagnostic data from a Profibus device using the Profibus DPV1 protocol. The program should implement a CASE statement to handle 10 specific diagnostic data types, such as communication errors, device status, and parameter faults. Each diagnostic type should be mapped to a concrete data type, ensuring that the retrieved information is processed accurately and efficiently. Discuss the logic behind handling these diagnostic data types, including error detection and fault handling mechanisms, to ensure robust communication with the Profibus device.

ðŸŸ¥ R (Role) â€“ Your Role

Act as a PLC programmer developing diagnostic management logic for Profibus DPV1 devices using IEC 61131-3 Structured Text.

â¸»

ðŸŸ© T (Task) â€“ What You Need to Do

Create a self-contained IEC 61131-3 Structured Text program that retrieves and processes diagnostic data from a Profibus DPV1 device. The program must use a CASE statement to handle 10 specific diagnostic types, including:
	â€¢	Communication errors
	â€¢	Device status
	â€¢	Parameter faults
	â€¢	Hardware faults
	â€¢	Watchdog timeouts
	â€¢	Configuration mismatches
	â€¢	Power supply issues
	â€¢	Bus interruptions
	â€¢	Temperature warnings
	â€¢	Manufacturer-specific messages

Each diagnostic type should be parsed and mapped to a specific variable or structure, and appropriate error or fault flags should be set for the control system to respond.

ðŸŸ§ F (Format) â€“ Expected Output

Deliver an IEC 61131-3 ST program that includes:
	â€¢	Inputs: a trigger signal (e.g., Execute), a target device address, and optional timeout or retry parameters
	â€¢	A CASE-based diagnostic parser that matches type codes and maps data to variables
	â€¢	Outputs: structured variables (e.g., CommError: BOOL, TempWarning: BOOL), as well as general status flags (Done, Error, ErrorID)
	â€¢	Robust error-handling logic for unknown diagnostic types or communication failures
	â€¢	Inline comments for maintainability and integration into existing PLC control programs

**Notes:**

1.	Ensure that the program is flexible enough to accommodate future diagnostic types or changes in the Profibus DPV1 protocol.
2.	Consider using a combination of bitwise operations and conditional statements to efficiently parse diagnostic data.
3.	Implement a timeout mechanism to handle slow or unresponsive devices, and provide an option to retry the diagnostic request if necessary.
4.	Use meaningful variable names and follow best practices for structured text programming to make the code easy to understand and maintain.
5.	Consider using a library or function block to encapsulate the Profibus communication logic, making it easier to reuse the diagnostic management program in other projects.
6.	Test the program thoroughly with various diagnostic scenarios to ensure its accuracy and robustness.
7.	Document any assumptions, limitations, or known issues in the code or in your response.

**Example:**

```st
PROGRAM Diagnostic_Manager
VAR
	DeviceAddress: WORD;
	Execute: BOOL;
	Timeout: DWORD;
	Retry: DWORD;
	CommError: BOOL;
	TempWarning: BOOL;
	ErrorID: WORD;
	DiagnosticData: BYTE[8];
	DiagnosticType: WORD;
	DiagnosticValue: DWORD;
	DiagnosticName: STRING[32];
	DiagnosticDescription: STRING[128];
	i: DWORD;
END_VAR

BEGIN
	IF Execute THEN
		DiagnosticData := Profibus_DPV1_GetDiagnosticData(DeviceAddress, DiagnosticData, Timeout, Retry);
		IF DiagnosticData <> 0 THEN
			DiagnosticType := DiagnosticData[1];
			CASE DiagnosticType OF
				1: CommError := TRUE;
				2: TempWarning := TRUE;
				3: ...
				10: ...
				OTHERS: ErrorID := 99;
			END_CASE;
		END_IF;
	END_IF;
END_PROGRAM
```
