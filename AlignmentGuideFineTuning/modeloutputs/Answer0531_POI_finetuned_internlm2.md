### Intent:
**Intent Summary:**  
Develop an IEC 61131-3 Structured Text PLC program for an automatic car wash station that safely initiates washing only when a car is detected and no humans are present, immediately halts on human intrusion with an alarm, and locks the system until the area is clear.  

*(Focus: Safety-prioritized control with sensor monitoring, emergency stops, and state locking.)*

### Prompt:
**Automatic Car Wash Station Control Using 61131-3 Structured Text:**

Write a PLC program in structured text (ST) according to IEC 61131-3 standards to control an automatic car wash station with a single wash bay. The system should use a sensor to detect the presence of a car. Once the car is detected and no human is present in the wash area, the system should initiate the car wash process. If a human is detected within the car wash area at any point, the station should immediately stop the wash process, trigger an alarm, and remain in a safe state until the area is clear.

ðŸŸ¥ R (Role) â€“ Your Role

You are a PLC programmer tasked with developing a safe and efficient control system for an automatic car wash station using IEC 61131-3 Structured Text (ST). Your objective is to ensure the wash cycle operates only under safe conditions and immediately halts in case of human presence.

ðŸŸ© I (Input) â€“ What Youâ€™re Given

You are provided with the following system components:
	â€¢	Sensors:
	â€¢	CarPresentSensor : BOOL â€” TRUE when a car is inside the wash bay
	â€¢	HumanDetectedSensor : BOOL â€” TRUE when a person is detected inside the bay
	â€¢	Outputs to control:
	â€¢	WashActive : BOOL â€” TRUE when the wash process is running
	â€¢	AlarmActive : BOOL â€” TRUE when a human is detected during wash operation
	â€¢	SafeToRun : BOOL â€” internal flag to lock/unlock wash permission based on safety state

â¸»

ðŸŸ§ S (Steps) â€“ What You Need to Do
	1.	Monitor the sensors each scan cycle:
	â€¢	Continuously check the presence of a car (CarPresentSensor)
	â€¢	Continuously check for human detection (HumanDetectedSensor)
	2.	Develop the control logic using structured text:
	â€¢	If a human is detected at any time, stop the wash (WashActive := FALSE), set the alarm (AlarmActive := TRUE), and disable further operation (SafeToRun := FALSE)
	â€¢	If a car is present, no human is detected, and SafeToRun = TRUE, allow the wash to start
	â€¢	Once the area is clear and the wash is inactive, reset SafeToRun to TRUE to enable a new cycle
	3.	Document each condition clearly with comments explaining:
	â€¢	The priority of human safety
	â€¢	Why the wash process must lock after a safety breach
	â€¢	How SafeToRun prevents immediate unsafe restarts

â¸»

ðŸŸ¦ E (Expectation) â€“ What Success Looks Like

You will have implemented a reliable and safe car wash controller that:
	â€¢	Starts washing only when a car is detected and no person is present
	â€¢	Instantly halts and alarms when a person enters during the cycle
	â€¢	Locks out the system until the area is verified clear and wash is idle
	â€¢	Can be easily integrated with HMI displays, safety relays, and alarm beacons
	â€¢	Follows structured and maintainable logic written according to IEC 61131-3 ST standards

ðŸŸª A (Additional) â€“ Context/Constraints

Focus on the safety-critical aspects of the car wash control system, ensuring that human presence is always prioritized over the wash process. The logic should be self-contained within the PLC, with minimal reliance on external systems. The code should be modular, well-documented, and adhere to IEC 61131-3 Structured Text conventions.
**Automatic Car Wash Station Control Using 61131-3 Structured Text:**

**C-A-R:**

ðŸŸ¥ C (Context) â€“ Background

An automatic car wash station requires precise control to ensure the safety of both the car and the wash bay operator. The system must detect the presence of a car and only initiate the wash cycle when no humans are present. If a human is detected during the wash process, the system must immediately stop the cycle, trigger an alarm, and remain in a safe state until the area is clear.

ðŸŸ© A (Action) â€“ The Action Taken

Develop a PLC program in IEC 61131-3 Structured Text (ST) to control the car wash station, ensuring that the wash cycle only starts when a car is present and no humans are detected. The program should include logic to stop the wash process and trigger an alarm if a human is detected during the cycle. Additionally, the system should lock itself out until the area is clear and the wash is idle.

ðŸŸ¨ R (Result) â€“ The Outcome

The PLC program successfully controls the car wash station, ensuring that the wash cycle only starts when a car is present and no humans are detected. If a human is detected during the wash process, the system immediately stops the cycle, triggers an alarm, and locks itself out until the area is clear. The program adheres to IEC 61131-3 Structured Text conventions and is self-contained within the PLC, with minimal reliance on external systems.

ðŸŸ© R (Reflection) â€“ What You Learned

Developing a PLC program for an automatic car wash station requires careful consideration of safety-critical aspects. By prioritizing human safety and implementing logic to stop the wash process and trigger alarms when a human is detected, the system ensures that the wash cycle only proceeds under safe conditions. The use of IEC 61131-3 Structured Text allows for clear and modular control logic, making the program easy to understand and maintain.
