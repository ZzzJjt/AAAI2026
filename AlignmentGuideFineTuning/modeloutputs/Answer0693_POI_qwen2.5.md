**Control Narrative for Ethanol Production**

**Section 3: Fermentation**

**3.1 Inoculation Control**

The fermentation process begins with the inoculation of yeast into the fermentation tank. The control objective is to ensure that the yeast is introduced at the correct time and quantity to initiate fermentation. The setpoint for inoculation is based on the calculated amount of yeast required for the batch size. The control logic involves monitoring the tank's temperature and pH to ensure they are within the optimal range for yeast viability. If the temperature or pH deviates from the setpoint, an alarm is triggered, and the operator is notified to adjust the conditions accordingly. The inoculation process is interlocked with the temperature and pH control to prevent the introduction of yeast under unfavorable conditions.

**3.2 Temperature Regulation**

Temperature control is critical during fermentation to maintain optimal conditions for yeast growth and ethanol production. The setpoint for temperature is typically between 32Â°C and 35Â°C. The control logic involves monitoring the temperature using thermocouples and adjusting the cooling or heating system as needed. If the temperature deviates from the setpoint, an alarm is triggered, and the operator is notified to adjust the cooling or heating system. The temperature control is interlocked with the pH control to prevent the introduction of yeast under unfavorable conditions.

**3.3 pH Control**

pH control is essential during fermentation to maintain optimal conditions for yeast growth and ethanol production. The setpoint for pH is typically between 4.5 and 5.0. The control logic involves monitoring the pH using a pH meter and adjusting the acid or alkali addition system as needed. If the pH deviates from the setpoint, an alarm is triggered, and the operator is notified to adjust the acid or alkali addition system. The pH control is interlocked with the temperature control to prevent the introduction of yeast under unfavorable conditions.

**3.4 Agitation/Mixing**

Agitation is necessary during fermentation to ensure proper mixing of the yeast and substrate, which promotes yeast growth and ethanol production. The setpoint for agitation speed is typically between 1
