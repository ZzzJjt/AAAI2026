### Intent:
**Intent Summary:**  
Develop an IEC 61131-3 Structured Text program for feedforward control in chemical mixing, dynamically adjusting Reactant A's flow rate based on Reactant B's flow and concentration to maintain a 2:1 ratio, with input validation, safety clamping, and diagnostic logging.

### Prompt:
**Feedforward Control Mixing:**

Develop a self-contained IEC 61131-3 Structured Text program (not a function block) to implement feedforward control for mixing two reactants in a chemical process. The program should predict the necessary adjustments to the flow rates of each reactant based on known disturbances or input changes, ensuring optimal mixing conditions.

Include logic that calculates the required feedforward adjustments based on process variables such as flow rates, concentration, and temperature, and ensure the control system can respond quickly to input changes without relying solely on feedback. Discuss the advantages of using feedforward control in mixing processes, particularly in terms of improving response time and reducing process variability compared to traditional feedback control.

**C-A-R-E:**

ðŸŸ¥ C (Context) â€“ The Background

In chemical mixing processes, maintaining the precise ratio of two reactants is critical to product quality. Traditional feedback control can be too slow to react to upstream changes in flow, concentration, or temperature, leading to off-spec mixtures and process instability. Feedforward control addresses this by proactively adjusting flow rates based on known disturbances, improving mixing accuracy and response time.

ðŸŸ© A (Action) â€“ The Implementation Task

Develop a self-contained IEC 61131-3 Structured Text program (not a function block) that implements feedforward control to dynamically regulate the mixing of two reactants:
	â€¢	Monitor incoming flow rate, concentration, or temperature of one reactant (Reactant B).
	â€¢	Calculate the required flow rate of the other reactant (Reactant A) to maintain a target mixing ratio.
	â€¢	Use a compensation factor to adjust for varying concentration or thermal effects.
	â€¢	Ensure that flow adjustments are made in advance, without relying solely on feedback loops.

ðŸŸ¨ R (Result) â€“ The Expected Outcome

Your control system will:
	â€¢	Enable faster, more accurate mixing by anticipating changes in reactant properties.
	â€¢	Stabilize the mixing ratio even under upstream disturbances.
	â€¢	Reduce product variability and improve yield.
	â€¢	Lay the foundation for hybrid feedforward-feedback strategies in chemical control systems.

ðŸŸ¦ E (Example) â€“ Code Snippet
VAR
    // Inputs
    Desired_Ratio : REAL := 2.0;        // Target ratio A:B
    Flow_B : REAL;                      // Measured flow rate of Reactant B (L/min)
    Concentration_B : REAL := 0.8;      // Concentration of Reactant B
    Temperature_B : REAL := 25.0;       // Optional: temperature of Reactant B

    // Output
    Flow_A_Setpoint : REAL;

    // Compensation factor (if concentration or temperature influences flow)
    Compensation_Factor : REAL := 1.0;  
END_VAR

// Calculate Reactant A flow setpoint
Flow_A_Setpoint := Desired_Ratio * Flow_B * Compensation_Factor;

// Optional: update compensation factor dynamically if needed
// Compensation_Factor := f(Concentration_B, Temperature_B);
This structure enables real-time feedforward control in a modular, maintainable formâ€”ideal for use in PLCs managing batch or continuous chemical mixing systems.
