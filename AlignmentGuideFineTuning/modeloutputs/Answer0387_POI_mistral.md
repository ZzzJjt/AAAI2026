### Intent:
**Intent Summary:**  
Create a text-based Piping and Instrumentation Diagram (P&ID) for a power plant steam-water cycle, detailing equipment, instrumentation, control loops with tag names, and piping flow paths in structured textual notation for design, documentation, and automation integration.  

**Code Generation Intent:**  
Generate a textual P&ID representation of a steam-water cycle with tagged instruments, control loops, and piping logic for non-graphical environments.

### Prompt:
**P-ID Steam Water Cycle:**

Create a P&I diagram in textual notation for a steam water cycle in a power plant. Include equipment, instrumentation, piping, and control loops. Provide concrete tag names.

**C-A-R-E:**

🟥 C (Context) – Background Situation

In power plant engineering, the steam-water cycle is a critical process that involves feedwater supply, steam generation, energy transfer, and condensate recovery. Typically, this system is documented using graphical Piping and Instrumentation Diagrams (P&IDs). However, in environments where visual tools aren’t available—such as early-stage design, textual documentation, or version-controlled environments—engineers often rely on structured textual notation to convey the same information effectively.

⸻

🟩 A (Action) – Task to Perform

Create a text-based P&ID for a steam-water cycle that includes:
	•	Process equipment (e.g., boiler, steam drum, feedwater pump, condenser)
	•	Instrumentation (e.g., pressure transmitters, level controllers, flow elements)
	•	Control loops with concrete tag names (e.g., FT101, FCV102, LT103)
	•	Piping flow paths clearly represented using arrows (-->) and structured indentation

Ensure the layout clearly communicates the relationship between instruments, control logic, and equipment within the system.

⸻

🟨 R (Result) – Expected Outcome

The result will be a readable, logically sequenced P&ID in textual format, suitable for:
	•	Early-stage design discussions
	•	Control narrative development
	•	Integration with PLC or DCS logic
	•	Documenting control loop structure for cross-disciplinary teams

It will serve as a bridge between process design and automation, even in environments where graphical diagrams are not practical.

T01  --> FT103 --> FIC103 --> FCV103 --> Deaerator D02
D02  --> FT104 --> FIC104 --> FCV104 --> Feedwater Pump P03

In this example, the textual P&ID represents the flow of water through the steam-water cycle, with each component (e.g., Boiler B01, Feedwater Tank T01) connected by arrows (-->). Instruments (e.g., FT101, LT102) are placed between components and control valves (e.g., FCV101, FCV103) to show the control loop structure.

🟦 E (Extension) – Additional Information

To further enhance the textual P&ID, consider adding:
	•	Instrument tag names (e.g., FT101: Feedwater Temperature Transmitter)
	•	Control loop descriptions (e.g., LT102: Level Controller for Steam Drum D01)
	•	Piping material (e.g., P01: Carbon Steel Pipe)
	•	Piping size (e.g., P01: 6-inch diameter)
	•	Piping insulation (e.g., P01: Insulated with 2-inch thick calcium silicate)
	•	Piping supports (e.g., P01: Supported by 4-inch diameter steel pipe hangers)

These additional details can help engineers and technicians better understand the system and its requirements during design, construction, and maintenance phases.
