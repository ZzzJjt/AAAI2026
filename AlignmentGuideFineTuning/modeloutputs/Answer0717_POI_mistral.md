### Intent:
**Intent Summary:**  
Develop an IEC 61131-3 Structured Text function block that encapsulates a C-based OPC UA client, providing PLC programmers with a standardized interface (Execute/ServerUrl/Timeout inputs, Done/Busy/Error outputs) to manage server connections, handle errors, and integrate seamlessly into industrial automation systems.  

*(Focus: C-to-ST integration, OPC UA client lifecycle, and PLC-friendly error handling.)*

### Prompt:
**OPC UA Client Implementation Using C and IEC 61131-3 Structured Text:**

Develop C-code for an OPC UA client, then wrap it into an IEC 61131-based function block written in structured text (ST). The function block should have the following input pins: Execute (type: BOOL), ServerUrl (type: STRING[255]), and Timeout (type: TIME). The output pins should include Done (type: BOOL), Busy (type: BOOL), Error (type: BOOL), and ErrorID (type: DWORD). In your explanation, describe how the C-code interfaces with the OPC UA server, how the function block manages communication with the server, and how error handling is implemented. Provide details on how to integrate this function block within an IEC 61131-3 environment for reliable client-server communication.

ðŸŸ¥ R (Role) â€“ Your Role

Act as a control systems programmer integrating C-based communication libraries into an IEC 61131-3 Structured Text (ST) environment for industrial automation.

â¸»

ðŸŸ© T (Task) â€“ What You Need to Do

Develop a C-based OPC UA client using a library such as open62541, and encapsulate its functionality within an IEC 61131-3 Structured Text function block. The function block must manage connection lifecycle and expose a clear interface to PLC programmers:

Inputs:
	â€¢	Execute (BOOL): Starts the connection attempt
	â€¢	ServerUrl (STRING[255]): Specifies the target OPC UA server
	â€¢	Timeout (TIME): Defines the maximum time to wait for a response

Outputs:
	â€¢	Done (BOOL): Indicates successful completion
	â€¢	Busy (BOOL): Signals an ongoing connection attempt
	â€¢	Error (BOOL): Signals failure
	â€¢	ErrorID (DWORD): Provides diagnostic information

Additionally, you must describe how the C code interfaces with the OPC UA server and how the ST function block tracks execution status, handles timeouts, and reports errors.

ðŸŸ§ F (Format) â€“ Expected Output

Deliver:
	â€¢	A modular and reusable ST function block implementing the above interface
	â€¢	A C function or library that establishes and manages OPC UA client connections
	â€¢	Internal logic within the ST block for rising-edge detection on Execute, non-blocking status transitions (Busy, Done), and structured error reporting via ErrorID
	â€¢	Integration documentation explaining how to link the C code to the ST block and embed it in a typical PLC cycle

**Step 1: OPC UA Client Implementation in C**

1.1 Choose an OPC UA C library, such as open62541, to create the OPC UA client.

1.2 Implement the C code for the OPC UA client, including:
	â€¢	Initializing the client
	â€¢	Connecting to the specified server
	â€¢	Sending and receiving data as needed
	â€¢	Disconnecting from the server
	â€¢	Error handling and reporting

1.3 Wrap the C code into a function or library with the following signature:

```c
typedef struct {
	bool done;
	bool busy;
	bool error;
	unsigned int error_id;
} opc_ua_client_status_t;

opc_ua_client_status_t opc_ua_client_execute(const char* server_url, unsigned int timeout_ms);
```

**Step 2: IEC 61131-3 Structured Text Function Block Implementation**

2.1 Create a new ST function block with the specified inputs and outputs.

2.2 Implement the ST logic for the function block:

```st
PROGRAM opc_ua_client;
VAR_INPUT
	Execute: BOOL;
	ServerUrl: STRING[255];
	Timeout: TIME;
VAR_OUTPUT
	Done: BOOL;
	Busy: BOOL;
	Error: BOOL;
	ErrorID: DWORD;

VAR
	client_status: opc_ua_client_status_t;
	client: opc_ua_client_t;
	start_time: TIME;
	elapsed_time: TIME;

BEGIN
	IF (Execute) THEN
		start_time := T#now;
		client := opc_ua_client_execute(ServerUrl, Timeout);
		elapsed_time := T#now - start_time;
		IF (client.done) THEN
			Done := TRUE;
			Busy := FALSE;
			Error := FALSE;
		ELSE
			IF (el
