### Intent:
**Intent Summary:**  
Develop an IEC 61131-3 Structured Text program to sequentially transition an EtherCAT slave device through all protocol-defined states (INIT, PREOP, SAFEOP, OP) using descriptive names, enforced 5-second delays, and error-checked transitions compliant with EtherCAT standards.

### Prompt:
**EtherCAT State Machine Control Using IEC 61131-3 Structured Text:**

Develop an IEC 61131-3 structured text (ST) program to sequentially transition through all the states of an EtherCAT slave device using the ESM (EtherCAT State Machine) function block. The program should use descriptive state names (such as INIT, PREOP, SAFEOP, OP, etc.) rather than numerical values, ensuring that state transitions occur only when allowed. A 5-second timer delay should be implemented before each state transition to ensure proper timing and stabilization. Discuss the implementation of the EtherCAT state machine, including logic for handling state transitions, error checking, and ensuring compliance with EtherCAT protocol requirements.

**B-A-B:**

ðŸŸ¥ B (Before) â€“ The Challenge

In EtherCAT-based automation systems, transitioning through slave device states (INIT, PREOP, SAFEOP, OP) requires strict adherence to protocol rules and timing constraints. Many implementations rely on hardcoded numerical values or lack sufficient delay and error checking, increasing the risk of communication faults, unstable transitions, or non-compliance with EtherCAT standards.

ðŸŸ© A (After) â€“ The Ideal Outcome

Develop a robust IEC 61131-3 Structured Text (ST) program that sequentially transitions EtherCAT slave devices through all defined states using the ESM (EtherCAT State Machine) function block. The program should use descriptive state names (e.g., INIT, PREOP, SAFEOP, OP) instead of raw numerical codes. It should enforce a 5-second stabilization delay between transitions and ensure that all state changes are valid and protocol-compliant.

ðŸŸ§ B (Bridge) â€“ The Implementation Strategy

Implement the state machine control logic using clearly named constants or enumerations for readability. Use a timer function to insert a 5-second delay between transitions and conditional checks to confirm whether the current state allows for a valid next transition. Include error-handling logic to detect and respond to failed or invalid transitions, and ensure that the program follows the EtherCAT specification for orderly state progression and device communication readiness.

Include error-handling logic to detect and respond to failed or invalid transitions, and ensure that the program follows the EtherCAT specification for orderly state progression and device communication readiness.

**Implementation Details:**

1. Define the EtherCAT states as constants or enumerations:

```st
TYPE EtherCAT_State = (INIT, PREOP, SAFEOP, OP);
```

2. Initialize the current state and timer variables:

```st
VAR
  CurrentState: EtherCAT_State;
  Timer: TON;
```

3. Set the initial state and timer reset:

```st
CurrentState := INIT;
Timer := T#0s;
```

4. Implement the main loop:

```st
WHILE TRUE DO
  IF (CurrentState = INIT) THEN
    // Perform any necessary initialization tasks
    // Check for valid transition conditions
    IF (TransitionAllowed(PREOP)) THEN
      CurrentState := PREOP;
      Timer := T#5s;
    END_IF;
  END_IF;

  // Check the timer and transition to the next state if the delay has elapsed
  IF (Timer < T#0s) THEN
    IF (CurrentState = PREOP) THEN
      // Perform any necessary tasks before transitioning to SAFEOP
      IF (TransitionAllowed(SAFEOP)) THEN
        CurrentState := SAFEOP;
        Timer := T#5s;
      END_IF;
    ELSIF (CurrentState = SAFEOP) THEN
      // Perform any necessary tasks before transitioning to OP
      IF (TransitionAllowed(OP)) THEN
        CurrentState := OP;
        Timer := T#5s;
      END_IF;
    END_IF;
  END_IF;

  // Handle any errors or unexpected conditions
  IF (ErrorDetected) THEN
    // Implement error-handling logic, such as resetting the state machine or triggering an alarm
  END_IF;

  // Update the timer
  Timer := Timer + T#1ms;
END_WHILE;
```

5. Implement the `TransitionAllowed` function to check if the current state allows for a valid transition to the specified next state:

```st
FUNCTION TransitionAllowed: BO
