Focus on the development of a Python script that implements a model predictive control (MPC) algorithm for optimizing the operation of a turbine in a thermal power plant. The MPC should consider the dynamic thermal behavior of the turbine, operational constraints, energy efficiency goals, and external disturbances. Ensure that the script includes a dynamic model of the turbineâ€™s thermal behavior, an MPC algorithm implementation with a predictive horizon and constraints, and simulation logic for varying load conditions and external disturbances. Provide text-based output to demonstrate the MPCâ€™s performance in controlling the turbine under different operating conditions.

ðŸŸ¥ Rï¼ˆRationaleï¼‰

Model predictive control (MPC) is a widely used technique in process control to optimize the performance of dynamic systems by predicting future states and adjusting control actions accordingly. In the context of a thermal power plant, MPC can be applied to optimize the operation of turbines, ensuring efficient energy use and maintaining stable performance under varying load conditions and external disturbances. Developing a Python script to implement MPC for turbine optimization requires a deep understanding of the thermal dynamics of turbines, as well as the ability to model and control complex systems using mathematical algorithms.
