### Intent:
**Intent Summary:**  
Create a state machine-based PLC program to control a polyethylene batch process, managing sequential phases (raw material preparation, reaction, cooling, discharge) with safety checks, timer logic, and fault handling.  

**Key Focus:**  
- State transitions (Idle â†’ RawMatPrep â†’ Reaction â†’ Cooling â†’ Discharge)  
- Valve control (ethylene/catalyst/discharge)  
- Parameter validation and fault monitoring  
- Time-based phase progression using `TON` timers

### Prompt:
**List Mathematical Function Blocks:**
Compile a detailed list of all mathematical function blocks available in the OSCAT library for PLC programming, including a brief description of their functionality and typical use cases.

**R-T-F:**

ðŸŸ¥ R (Role) â€“ Your Role

ðŸŸ© T (Task) â€“ What You Need to Do

Create a detailed list of all mathematical function blocks available in the OSCAT library. For each block, you should:
	â€¢	State the block name
	â€¢	Provide a concise description of its functionality
	â€¢	Explain its typical use case in industrial control or automation logic
	â€¢	Optionally note any constraints (e.g., input type, range, limitations)

Group the blocks into categories such as:
	â€¢	Trigonometric
	â€¢	Algebraic
	â€¢	Statistical
	â€¢	Exponential & Logarithmic
	â€¢	Array operations

ðŸŸ¦ F (Format) â€“ What the Output Should Look Like

Your final output should be structured as a reference document or cheat sheet, presented in:
	â€¢	A table or bullet-point list format
	â€¢	Organized by category
	â€¢	Suitable for use in manuals, onboarding kits, or engineering wikis

Example Format:

### Trigonometric Functions
- **SIN(x)** â€“ Returns the sine of x (radians).  
  *Use case*: Signal generation, motor control.

- **COS(x)** â€“ Returns the cosine of x.  
  *Use case*: Phase angle computations.

### Statistical Functions
- **MEAN_ARRAY(array)** â€“ Computes the mean of an array.  
  *Use case*: Smoothing sensor data in process control.

- **STDDEV_ARRAY(array)** â€“ Calculates the standard deviation.  
  *Use case*: Quality control and anomaly detection.
