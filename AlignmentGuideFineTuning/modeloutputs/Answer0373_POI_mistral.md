### Intent:
"Create a reusable IEC 61131-3 structured text function block that safely converts 10-digit decimal values to hexadecimal strings with edge-case handling for industrial PLC applications."

### Prompt:
**DecToHex:**
Implement a self-contained function block in IEC 61131-3 structured text to convert a 10-digit decimal value to hexadecimal. Ensure proper handling of large values and edge cases.

**C-A-R-E:**

ðŸŸ¥ C (Context) â€“ Background Situation

In industrial automation, converting decimal values to hexadecimal is essential for diagnostics, communication protocols, and memory addressing. However, IEC 61131-3 Structured Text does not always offer built-in methods to handle large decimal numbers (up to 10 digits) and edge cases such as zero or type overflow. A dedicated, reusable function block is needed to safely perform this conversion in scan-cycle-sensitive environments.

ðŸŸ© A (Action) â€“ Task to Perform

Develop a self-contained function block in IEC 61131-3 Structured Text that:
	â€¢	Accepts a 10-digit decimal input (LINT type recommended)
	â€¢	Converts the value to a hexadecimal string output
	â€¢	Includes proper handling of edge cases, such as zero values and upper-limit overflow
	â€¢	Uses a loop to divide the decimal by 16, maps the remainder to its corresponding hex digit (0â€“F), and assembles the hex string in reverse order
	â€¢	Optionally trims leading zeros and provides a minimal-length result

â¸»

ðŸŸ¨ R (Result) â€“ Expected Outcome

The result should be a modular and scan-safe function block that can be integrated into any PLC program requiring decimal-to-hex conversion. It should ensure accuracy, support a wide input range, and be easy to reuse, maintain, and document, making it ideal for use in logging, HMI displays, and communication routines.

ðŸŸ¦ E (Example) â€“ Concrete Illustration

Hereâ€™s a conceptual snippet of the core logic:

WHILE DecValue > 0 DO
   Remainder := DecValue MOD 16;
   HexDigit := DigitMap[Remainder]; // e.g., DigitMap[10] = 'A'
   HexString := CONCAT(HexDigit, HexString); // prepend digit
   DecValue := DecValue / 16;
END_WHILE;

IF HexString = '' THEN
   HexString := '0'; // handle zero input
END_IF;

IF HexString = '' THEN
   HexString := '0'; // handle zero input

The function block should be named "DecToHex" and have input and output variables defined as follows:

INPUT:
	â€¢	DecValue (LINT): 10-digit decimal input

OUTPUT:
	â€¢	HexString (STRING): 2-digit hexadecimal output (minimum length)

ðŸŸ¦ T (Test) â€“ Verification Steps

1. Create a test program with a timer and a counter that increments every 100ms.
2. Connect the counter to the DecValue input of the DecToHex function block.
3. Connect the output of the DecToHex function block to an HMI display or a text output.
4. Run the program and observe the conversion results for various input values (e.g., 0, 1234567890, 9999999999).
5. Verify that the function block handles edge cases correctly and produces the expected results.
6. Test the function block with different PLC platforms to ensure compatibility and portability.
7. Document the function block, including its purpose, input/output variables, and any limitations or assumptions.
8. Share the function block with colleagues or the PLC community for feedback and improvement.
