### Intent:
**Intent Summary:**  
Create a reusable IEC 61131-3 Structured Text function block to compute the mean and sample standard deviation of a 100-integer array, with overflow protection and real-time applicability for industrial automation tasks like sensor analysis and quality control.

### Prompt:
**Mean and StdDev:**

Create a self-contained function block in IEC 61131-3 Structured Text to compute both the mean and standard deviation of an input array consisting of 100 integers. Ensure that the function block is modular and includes detailed comments explaining the steps of calculating both statistical measures. Address potential issues related to overflow or precision when handling large datasets, and provide insights into the function block’s applicability within real-time control systems.

**B-A-B:**

🟥 B (Before) – The Challenge

In industrial automation, understanding variability in sensor data or process measurements is key to diagnostics, control performance, and quality assurance. However, many PLC platforms lack native statistical functions, and computing statistics like mean and standard deviation efficiently—especially for larger datasets—can be difficult due to precision limits, overflow risks, and real-time scan-time constraints.

🟩 A (After) – The Ideal Outcome

Develop a self-contained function block in IEC 61131-3 Structured Text named MeanStdDevCalculator that:
	•	Accepts a fixed-size input array of 100 integers: InputArray : ARRAY[1..100] OF INT
	•	Computes and outputs:
	•	Mean : REAL – the arithmetic average of the array values
	•	StdDev : REAL – the standard deviation based on the sample formula
	•	Follows this logic:
	1.	Sum all values and divide by 100 to get the mean
	2.	Subtract the mean from each value, square the result, and sum all squared differences
	3.	Divide the sum of squares by (100 - 1), then take the square root for standard deviation
	•	Includes detailed inline comments for each computation step
	•	Uses internal REAL variables to prevent integer overflow during accumulation and division
	•	Is modular and reusable for real-time control scenarios such as:
	•	Sensor noise filtering
	•	Statistical quality control
	•	Monitoring variance in cycle times

🟧 B (Bridge) – The Implementation Strategy

To build this function block:
	1.	Define the input and output variables:
 FUNCTION_BLOCK MeanStdDevCalculator
VAR_INPUT
    InputArray : ARRAY[1..100] OF INT;
END_VAR
VAR_OUTPUT
    Mean : REAL;
    StdDev : REAL;
END_VAR
VAR
    i : INT;
    Sum : REAL;
    SumSquaredDiff : REAL;
    Temp : REAL;
END_VAR
	  2.	Calculate the mean:
    Sum := 0;
FOR i := 1 TO 100 DO
    Sum := Sum + InputArray[i];
END_FOR;
Mean := Sum / 100.0;
    3.	Calculate the standard deviation:
    SumSquaredDiff := 0;
FOR i := 1 TO 100 DO
    Temp := InputArray[i] - Mean;
    SumSquaredDiff := SumSquaredDiff + (Temp * Temp);
END_FOR;
StdDev := SQRT(SumSquaredDiff / 99.0); // Sample standard deviation
    4.	Add comments to explain:
	•	Use of REAL to avoid overflow
	•	Importance of dividing by N - 1 for sample standard deviation
	•	Consideration for deterministic execution on a PLC
