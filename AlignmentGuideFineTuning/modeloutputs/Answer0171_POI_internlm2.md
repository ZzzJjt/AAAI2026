### Intent:
**Intent Summary:**  
Create a reusable IEC 61131-3 function block in Structured Text to compare two REAL values with configurable decimal precision, handling floating-point inaccuracies and input validation for reliable industrial automation logic.  

*(Key focus: Precision-based comparison, input safety, and PLC compatibility.)*

### Prompt:
**Binary Search:**
Implement a self-contained function block in IEC 61131-3 structured text to perform a binary search on an array of 100 integers. Include input validation and efficient handling of search boundaries.

**B-A-B:**

ðŸŸ¥ B (Before) â€“ The Problem or Challenge

Searching through large arrays in PLC-based systems can be inefficient if done linearly, especially in time-sensitive applications like sorting, classification, or threshold detection. Without a structured and optimized approach like binary search, search operations on a 100-element integer array could result in unnecessary CPU cycles, poor performance, and missed response deadlines in industrial control systems.

ðŸŸ© A (After) â€“ The Desired Outcome

Develop a self-contained function block in IEC 61131-3 Structured Text that performs a binary search on a 100-integer array. The function should:
	â€¢	Efficiently locate a target value using binary search logic
	â€¢	Include input validation (e.g., bounds check, sorted array assumption)
	â€¢	Handle search boundaries accurately to avoid indexing errors or infinite loops
	â€¢	Be modular and reusable in PLC programs where fast data lookup is essential

ðŸŸ§ B (Bridge) â€“ How to Get There
	1.	Define the function block interface with inputs for:
	â€¢	SearchArray : ARRAY[1..100] OF INT
	â€¢	TargetValue : INT
	â€¢	Enable : BOOL
	2.	Implement binary search logic using WHILE or REPEAT loops and variables like Low, High, and Mid.
	3.	Add validation to ensure the array index boundaries are respected and the search halts when Low > High or the value is found.
	4.	Include outputs such as:
	â€¢	Found : BOOL
	â€¢	Index : INT (position in array if found, else -1)
	5.	Comment each section for clarity and maintainability.

**B-A-B:**

ðŸŸ¥ B (Before) â€“ The Problem or Challenge

In industrial automation, it's common to compare two REAL values for equality or inequality. However, due to the inherent limitations of floating-point arithmetic, direct comparison can lead to inaccuracies and unexpected results. This is especially problematic when comparing values with different decimal precisions or when the values are close to each other.

ðŸŸ© A (After) â€“ The Desired Outcome

Develop a reusable function block in IEC 61131-3 Structured Text that compares two REAL values with configurable decimal precision. The function should:
	â€¢	Handle floating-point inaccuracies by comparing the values after adjusting for the specified decimal precision.
	â€¢	Include input validation to ensure the values are within a reasonable range and the precision is within acceptable limits.
	â€¢	Return a Boolean result indicating whether the values are equal or not.
	â€¢	Be modular and reusable in PLC programs where precise and reliable comparisons are essential.
