### Intent:
**Intent Summary:**  
Create an IEC 61131-3 Sequential Function Chart (SFC) to control a single intersection traffic light system with timed states (Green: 5s, Yellow: 2s, Red: 5s) using mutually exclusive outputs and cyclic operation.  

*(Focus: PLC logic for timed traffic light sequencing with looped states.)*

### Prompt:
**IO List Steam Water Cycle:**

Create an I/O list as a table for feedwater control in a steam-water cycle in a power plant. Have as columns names, signal tagnumber, analog/digital, engineering unit, ranges, setpoint, and P&ID reference.

**R-I-S-E:**

ðŸŸ¥ R (Role) â€“ Define Your Role

Act as a control systems engineer responsible for defining instrumentation and signal documentation for the feedwater control system in a steam-water cycle of a power plant.

â¸»

ðŸŸ© I (Input) â€“ Information Provided

You are to create an I/O list in table format that includes the following columns for each signal:
	â€¢	Signal Name
	â€¢	Signal Tag Number
	â€¢	Analog/Digital
	â€¢	Engineering Unit
	â€¢	Range
	â€¢	Setpoint
	â€¢	P&ID Reference

This list will cover essential elements of the feedwater control loop, such as flow transmitters, drum level indicators, control valves, and pump statuses.

ðŸŸ§ S (Steps) â€“ Steps to Perform
	1.	Identify common I/O signals associated with feedwater control, including:
	â€¢	Drum Level Transmitters
	â€¢	Feedwater Flow Transmitters
	â€¢	Control Valve Positions
	â€¢	Pump Start/Stop Signals
	2.	Assign each signal a unique tagnumber and specify whether it is analog or digital.
	3.	Add appropriate engineering units (e.g., %, t/h, bar), define realistic ranges (e.g., 0â€“100%), and enter typical setpoints.
	4.	Ensure each entry is linked to a P&ID reference for traceability and cross-discipline alignment.
	5.	Format the data into a clean, consistent table that can be imported into design tools, PLC/HMI projects, or engineering reports.

â¸»

ðŸŸ¦ E (Expectation) â€“ Expected Outcome

Deliver a complete and professionally structured I/O list for the feedwater control section of the steam-water cycle. This list will support:
	â€¢	PLC configuration
	â€¢	Instrumentation specification
	â€¢	HMI integration
	â€¢	Commissioning and validation aligned with P&ID documentation

Certainly! Below is a detailed IEC 61131-3 Sequential Function Chart (SFC) for a single-lane traffic light system at an intersection. The system controls the traffic lights at the intersection, ensuring safe and efficient movement of vehicles.

### Traffic Light Control SFC

![Traffic Light Control SFC Diagram](https://i.imgur.com/6jJ6jJl.png)

### SFC Description

#### Steps
1. **Wait for Trigger**: The system waits for a rising edge on the Trigger input (e.g., from a pedestrian button or sensor).
2. **Green Light On**: The traffic light turns green, allowing vehicles to proceed.
3. **Yellow Light On**: The traffic light turns yellow, warning vehicles to prepare to stop.
4. **Red Light On**: The traffic light turns red, stopping all traffic.
5. **Wait for Trigger Again**: The system waits for another rising edge on the Trigger input to restart the cycle.

#### Transitions
- **Green Light On**: Transitions when the Trigger input rises.
- **Yellow Light On**: Transitions after a 5-second timer (Timer1).
- **Red Light On**: Transitions after a 5-second timer (Timer1) and when Timer2 reaches 10 seconds.
- **Wait for Trigger Again**: Transitions when the Trigger input rises again.

#### Timer Configuration
- **Timer1**: Counts for 5 seconds to activate the yellow light.
- **Timer2**: Counts for 10 seconds to ensure the red light remains on for a safe duration.

### PLC Code

```st

    // Inputs
    Trigger : BOOL;                      // Rising edge to start cycle
