### Intent:
The intent is to generate a control program for a urea reaction process that manages valve operations and monitors pressure/temperature conditions to ensure a safe and complete chemical reaction.

### Prompt:
**Programming Reference:**
Compile a comprehensive list of all valid keywords used in the IEC 61131-3 Structured Text programming language, ensuring that it covers both standard control flow structures and data types. Include examples of usage for key functions where applicable.

**T-A-G:**

游린 T (Task)

Create a programming reference for the IEC 61131-3 Structured Text (ST) language by compiling a complete list of valid keywords.

游릴 A (Action)

Gather and categorize all official keywords specified in the IEC 61131-3 standard, including control flow structures (such as IF, CASE, FOR), standard functions (TON, CTU, ABS), and data types (INT, REAL, BOOL). Include concise usage examples or code snippets to illustrate how key functions and structures are typically used in automation programming.

游릱 G (Goal)

Deliver a well-organized, easy-to-use reference guide that supports engineers and developers in writing correct, efficient, and standards-compliant Structured Text code for industrial control systems.

   - Gather examples of code snippets and usage examples for key functions and structures.

2. **Categorization and Documentation:**
   - Organize the keywords into logical categories, such as control flow structures, standard functions, and data types.
   - Write concise descriptions for each keyword, explaining its purpose and usage.
   - Include examples of code snippets to demonstrate how each keyword is typically used in automation programming.

3. **Review and Refinement:**
   - Review the list of keywords and examples to ensure accuracy and completeness.
   - Refine the descriptions and examples based on feedback from subject matter experts or experienced programmers.
   - Ensure that the reference guide is well-structured, easy to navigate, and visually appealing.

4. **Testing and Validation:**
   - Test the reference guide by using it to write and debug simple automation programs.
   - Validate the accuracy of the examples and descriptions against the IEC 61131-3 standard and real-world programming scenarios.

5. **Finalization and Publication:**
   - Finalize the reference guide, ensuring that it is up-to-date and reflects the latest version of the IEC 61131-3 standard.
   - Publish the guide in a suitable format, such as a PDF or online document, making it easily accessible to engineers and developers.

**Expected Outcome:**

A comprehensive, well-organized, and accurate reference guide for the IEC 61131-3 Structured Text programming language, covering all valid keywords, control flow structures, standard functions, and data types. The guide will include usage examples and code snippets to illustrate how key functions and structures are typically used in automation programming, making it a valuable resource for engineers and developers working with industrial control systems.
