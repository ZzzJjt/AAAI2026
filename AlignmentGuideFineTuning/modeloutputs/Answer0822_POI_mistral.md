### Intent:
**Intent Summary:**  
Create an IEC 61131-3 Structured Text function block to monitor and log real-time communication status (OPC UA, Modbus, Profinet), trigger alarms on failures, and record diagnostic details for troubleshooting.  

*(Focus: Protocol-agnostic monitoring, fault logging, and real-time alerting.)*

### Prompt:
**Communication Monitoring for OPC UA, Modbus, and Profinet Using IEC 61131-3 Structured Text:**

Develop a function block in structured text (ST) as per IEC 61131-3 standards to monitor communication connections to an OPC UA server, Modbus server, and Profinet in a machine system. The function block should continuously check the connection status of each protocol, and if any connection fails, an alarm should be triggered. Additionally, when a connection is lost, an entry must be created in the audit trail, detailing the reason for the server being down along with the corresponding error code. Discuss the implementation logic for monitoring multiple protocols, error detection, and how to effectively manage and log communication failures for real-time monitoring and troubleshooting.

**T-A-G:**

ðŸŸ¥ T (Task) â€“ What You Need to Do

Create an IEC 61131-3 Structured Text (ST) function block to monitor communication status for OPC UA, Modbus, and Profinet protocols within a machine control system.

ðŸŸ© A (Action) â€“ How to Do It

Develop logic that continuously checks the connection status of each protocol. If any connection fails, the function block should raise an alarm and generate an audit trail entry containing the protocol name, reason for the failure, and an associated error code. The block should handle each protocol independently and include mechanisms for error detection, alarm handling, and memory-safe logging.

ðŸŸ¦ G (Goal) â€“ What You Aim to Achieve

Ensure robust, real-time communication monitoring and fault diagnostics for all three protocols, enabling operators and maintenance teams to quickly identify, respond to, and trace communication failuresâ€”thus improving system uptime and traceability.

**Implementation:**

1. Define the function block:
   - Name: COMM_MONITOR
   - Inputs:
     - OPC_UA_IP: IP address of the OPC UA server
     - OPC_UA_Port: Port number of the OPC UA server
     - MODBUS_IP: IP address of the Modbus server
     - MODBUS_Port: Port number of the Modbus server
     - PROFINET_IP: IP address of the Profinet device
     - PROFINET_VLAN: VLAN ID of the Profinet network
   - Outputs:
     - OPC_UA_Status: Boolean indicating the status of the OPC UA connection
     - MODBUS_Status: Boolean indicating the status of the Modbus connection
     - PROFINET_Status: Boolean indicating the status of the Profinet connection
     - Alarm: Boolean indicating if an alarm should be triggered
     - Audit_Trail: String containing the details of the communication failure

2. Initialize variables:
   - OPC_UA_Connected, MODBUS_Connected, PROFINET_Connected: Boolean variables to store the connection status of each protocol
   - OPC_UA_Error_Code, MODBUS_Error_Code, PROFINET_Error_Code: Integer variables to store the error codes associated with each failure
   - Audit_Trail_Buffer: String variable to store the audit trail details

3. Implement the main loop:
   - Continuously check the connection status of each protocol using appropriate functions or libraries for OPC UA, Modbus, and Profinet.
   - If any connection fails, set the corresponding Boolean variable to false and store the error code in the respective integer variable.
   - If any connection fails and the Alarm output is currently false, set the Alarm output to true and append the protocol name, error code, and error message to the Audit_Trail_Buffer.

4. Implement the alarm handling:
   - If the Alarm output is true, activate the appropriate visual or auditory alarm.

5. Implement the audit trail logging:
   - Periodically, or when the Alarm output changes, write the contents of the Audit_Trail_Buffer to a log file or database.
