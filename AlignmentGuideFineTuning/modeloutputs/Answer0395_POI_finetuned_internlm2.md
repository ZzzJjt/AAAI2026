### Intent:
**Intent Summary:**  
Create a 30-row I/O list table for a steel rolling mill, specifying signal names, I/O types, tagnumbers, analog/digital status, units, ranges, setpoints, and P&ID references to standardize control system integration.

### Prompt:
**IO List Rolling Mill:**

Create an I/O list as a table with 30 lines for a rolling mill in a steel production plant. Have as columns signal name, input/output, signal tagnumber, analog/digital, engineering unit, ranges, setpoint, and P&ID reference.

**C-A-R-E:**

🟥 C (Context) – Background Situation

In the design and automation of a rolling mill within a steel production plant, a clearly defined I/O list is essential for engineering coordination across instrumentation, control logic, wiring diagrams, and HMIs. This list ensures that all signals are accurately identified and mapped with associated parameters such as range, unit, and control setpoints—critical for system integration and commissioning.

⸻

🟩 A (Action) – Task to Perform

Create a structured I/O list table with 30 signals for a rolling mill. Each row should represent one signal and include the following columns:
	•	Signal Name
	•	Input/Output
	•	Signal Tagnumber
	•	Analog/Digital
	•	Engineering Unit
	•	Range
	•	Setpoint
	•	P&ID Reference

Ensure that signals represent realistic rolling mill components, such as roll gap sensors, motor drives, cooling valves, and tension feedback. Use consistent units (e.g., °C, bar, kN, m/min) and appropriate setpoints and ranges.

⸻

🟨 R (Result) – Expected Outcome

The result should be a complete, clearly formatted I/O list that serves as a master reference for system design, PLC programming, field wiring, and control documentation. It should improve communication between mechanical, electrical, and automation teams, and reduce integration errors during commissioning.

**R-I-S-E:**

🟥 R (Role) – Who Is Responsible?

The role responsible for creating this I/O list is a process control engineer or automation specialist in the steel production industry, who is tasked with defining the I/O signals for a rolling mill system, ensuring that all signals are accurately identified and mapped with associated parameters such as range, unit, and control setpoints.

⸻

🟩 I (Input) – What Information Is Needed?

To create the I/O list, the engineer needs to have a clear understanding of the rolling mill's mechanical and control systems, including the specific sensors, actuators, and control loops involved in the process. This includes knowledge of the rolling mill's mechanical components, such as rollers, motors, and tension control systems, as well as the control logic required to manage these components.

⸻

🟩 S (Solution) – How to Solve the Problem

To create the I/O list, follow these steps:

1.	Identify the key signals involved in the rolling mill's control system, including input and output signals for sensors, actuators, and control loops.
2.	Organize the signals into a 30-row table, with each row representing a single signal. Include the following columns:
	•	Signal Name: A descriptive name for the signal, such as "EntryRollSpeed" or "RollGapSetpoint."
	•	I/O: Indicate whether the signal is an input (IN) or output (OUT).
	•	Tag Number: The unique identifier for the signal in the control system.
	•	Analog/Digital: Specify whether the signal is analog (A) or digital (D).
	•	Engineering Unit: The unit of measurement for the signal, such as m/min, mm, kW, or Nm.
	•	Range: The valid range of the signal, including any upper and lower limits.
	•	Setpoint: The desired value for the signal, if applicable.
