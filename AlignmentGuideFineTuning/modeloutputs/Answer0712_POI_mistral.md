### Intent:
**Intent Summary:**  
Develop an IEC 61131-3 Structured Text function block to monitor OPC UA, Modbus, and Profinet connections, trigger alarms on failures, and log protocol-specific errors with timestamps for real-time diagnostics.

### Prompt:
**Communication Monitoring for OPC UA, Modbus, and Profinet Using IEC 61131-3 Structured Text:**

Develop a function block in structured text (ST) as per IEC 61131-3 standards to monitor communication connections to an OPC UA server, Modbus server, and Profinet in a machine system. The function block should continuously check the connection status of each protocol, and if any connection fails, an alarm should be triggered. Additionally, when a connection is lost, an entry must be created in the audit trail, detailing the reason for the server being down along with the corresponding error code. Discuss the implementation logic for monitoring multiple protocols, error detection, and how to effectively manage and log communication failures for real-time monitoring and troubleshooting.

**R-T-F:**

ðŸŸ¥ R (Role) â€“ Your Role

Act as a PLC programmer using IEC 61131-3 Structured Text to develop diagnostic and monitoring tools for industrial communication systems.

ðŸŸ© T (Task) â€“ Your Objective

Develop a Structured Text (ST) function block that monitors the communication status of OPC UA, Modbus, and Profinet protocols in a machine system. The block must continuously check each connection, trigger an alarm when a failure is detected, and log an entry in the audit trail with details such as the protocol, error reason, and error code. The function block should support independent handling of each protocol and be robust enough for real-time industrial use.

ðŸŸ§ F (Format) â€“ Expected Output

Provide an IEC 61131-3 compliant ST function block that includes:
	â€¢	Input variables for connection state and error information
	â€¢	Internal logic to detect communication failures and recoveries
	â€¢	Boolean alarms or error flags for each protocol
	â€¢	Structured audit logging (e.g., protocol name, error code, reason, timestamp)
	â€¢	Comments explaining logic for maintenance and reuse

**Implementation:**

1. Define input variables for each protocol's connection state, error information, and alarm status.

```st
VAR
  OPC_Connection: BOOL;
  Modbus_Connection: BOOL;
  Profinet_Connection: BOOL;
  OPC_Error_Code: WORD;
  Modbus_Error_Code: WORD;
  Profinet_Error_Code: WORD;
  OPC_Alarm: BOOL;
  Modbus_Alarm: BOOL;
  Profinet_Alarm: BOOL;
```

2. Implement a loop to continuously check the connection status of each protocol.

```st
REPEAT
  IF NOT OPC_Connection THEN
    // OPC UA connection check logic
    // If connection fails, set OPC_Error_Code and OPC_Alarm
  END_IF

  IF NOT Modbus_Connection THEN
    // Modbus connection check logic
    // If connection fails, set Modbus_Error_Code and Modbus_Alarm
  END_IF

  IF NOT Profinet_Connection THEN
    // Profinet connection check logic
    // If connection fails, set Profinet_Error_Code and Profinet_Alarm
  END_IF

  // Wait for a short period before checking again
  TON_ms(T_Check_Interval);
UNTIL FALSE;
```

3. Implement error recovery logic for each protocol, if applicable.

```st
IF OPC_Alarm THEN
  // OPC UA error recovery logic
  // If recovery is successful, reset OPC_Alarm and OPC_Error_Code
END_IF

IF Modbus_Alarm THEN
  // Modbus error recovery logic
  // If recovery is successful, reset Modbus_Alarm and Modbus_Error_Code
END_IF

IF Profinet_Alarm THEN
  // Profinet error recovery logic
  // If recovery is successful, reset Profinet_Alarm and Profinet_Error_Code
END_IF
```

4. Implement audit logging for each communication failure.

```st
IF
