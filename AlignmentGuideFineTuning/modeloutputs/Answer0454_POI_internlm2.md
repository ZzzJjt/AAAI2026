### Intent:
**Intent Summary:**  
Develop an IEC 61131-3 Structured Text function block to monitor and diagnose Ethernet PowerLink network nodes by retrieving real-time communication status, error codes, and health data via a managing node, ensuring fault detection and system reliability.  

*(Focus: ST-based diagnostics, PowerLink MN interaction, cyclic updates, error handling.)*

### Prompt:
**Ethernet PowerLink Diagnostics Using IEC 61131-3 Structured Text:**

Develop a function block in structured text (ST) based on IEC 61131 standards to retrieve Ethernet PowerLink diagnostic information from a control node device via a PowerLink managing node (MN). The function block should collect and display key diagnostic data such as communication status, error codes, and node health. The program must ensure that the diagnostic information is accurately processed and relayed to the controller for further analysis. Discuss how the function block interacts with the PowerLink network, handles error detection, and provides real-time diagnostics for maintaining network integrity.

**R-I-S-E:**

ðŸŸ¥ R (Role) â€“ Your Role

Act as an industrial automation engineer developing diagnostics and communication monitoring tools using IEC 61131-3 Structured Text for Ethernet PowerLink networks.

ðŸŸ© I (Input) â€“ What Youâ€™re Given

You are tasked with building a function block in Structured Text (ST) that retrieves diagnostic information from a PowerLink control node via a PowerLink Managing Node (MN). The diagnostic data must include communication status, error codes, and node health. The data should be processed and passed to the controller for analysis and real-time monitoring. The solution must handle error detection and support cyclic updates.

ðŸŸ§ S (Steps) â€“ What to Do

	1.	Design a function block interface with inputs for node identifiers and communication triggers, and outputs for status, error codes, and health indicators.
 
	2.	Implement cyclic polling logic that queries the MN for diagnostic information related to connected control nodes.
 
	3.	Parse and validate the returned diagnostic data, handling potential communication errors or missing responses.
 
	4.	Output structured diagnostic results to the controller or HMI, and ensure any critical errors are flagged appropriately for operator awareness.

ðŸŸ¦ E (Expectation) â€“ What Success Looks Like

The function block should provide accurate, real-time insight into the health of each PowerLink node. It should detect and report faults immediately, support maintenance decisions, and ensure that communication issues are logged and traceableâ€”enhancing system reliability and reducing troubleshooting time.

	* Explain the cyclic polling mechanism and its frequency.
	* Describe how the function block will handle communication errors or missing responses.
3. **Data Parsing and Validation:**
	* Outline the process of parsing and validating the diagnostic data.
	* Discuss how the function block will handle invalid or inconsistent data.
4. **Error Handling and Reporting:**
	* Describe how the function block will handle critical errors.
	* Explain how the function block will report errors to the controller or HMI.
5. **Scalability and Compatibility:**
	* Discuss how the function block can be adapted to accommodate larger networks.

**D-E-L-I-V-E-R-Y:**

1. **Function Block Design:**
	* The function block will have two inputs: `NodeID` (integer) and `CommTrigger` (boolean).
	* The `NodeID` input will specify the PowerLink node for which diagnostic information is requested.
	* The `CommTrigger` input will initiate the communication process.
	* The function block will have three outputs: `CommStatus` (boolean), `ErrorCodes` (array of integers), and `HealthData` (array of strings).
	* The `CommStatus` output will indicate the current communication status with the specified node.
	* The `ErrorCodes` output will contain a list of error codes associated with the node.
	* The `HealthData` output will provide a description of the node's health status.
2. **Cyclic Polling Logic:**
	* The function block will use a timer to trigger cyclic polling of the PowerLink MN.
	* The polling frequency will be adjustable to suit the network's requirements.
	* If a communication error occurs or the MN does not respond, the function block will retry the communication after a short delay.
	* If the retry limit is reached, the function block will flag the
