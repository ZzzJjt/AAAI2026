### Intent:
**Intent Summary:**  
Implement a Model Predictive Control (MPC) algorithm in C++ to optimize wind farm power output and grid stability by dynamically coordinating turbine operation, energy storage, and power dispatch under variable wind conditions.  

*(Focus: Real-time MPC for wind farm optimization with constraints on turbines, storage, and environmental fluctuations.)*

### Prompt:
**Model Predictive Control for Wind Farm Optimization Using C++:**

Develop C++ code to implement a model predictive control (MPC) algorithm to optimize the operation of a wind farm. The control system should consider factors such as wind speed variability, turbine dynamics, and power output efficiency. It should also ensure grid stability while accounting for constraints on turbine operation, energy storage, and power dispatch under fluctuating environmental conditions.

Implement C++ code to simulate the wind farmâ€™s operational dynamics and demonstrate the effectiveness of the MPC in managing real-time power generation and distribution.

**B-A-B:**

ðŸŸ¥ Bï¼ˆBeforeï¼‰

Wind farms operate under highly variable environmental conditions, such as fluctuating wind speeds, which makes it difficult to maintain optimal power output and grid stability. Traditional control strategies struggle to coordinate turbine dynamics, energy storage, and dispatch in real time while respecting operational constraints.

ðŸŸ© Aï¼ˆAfterï¼‰

Use model predictive control (MPC) to optimize wind farm performance by forecasting wind conditions, coordinating turbine behavior, managing energy storage, and adjusting power dispatch. The MPC should improve power output efficiency and ensure stable grid interaction despite environmental uncertainty.

ðŸŸ§ Bï¼ˆBridgeï¼‰

Develop C++ code that models the wind farmâ€™s dynamic behavior, including turbine mechanics, wind variability, and storage systems. Then implement an MPC algorithm to simulate real-time control decisions, demonstrating how MPC enables smarter power generation and distribution compared to conventional methods.
