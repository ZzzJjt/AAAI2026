### Intent:
**Intent Summary:**  
Create an IEC 61131-3 Structured Text program to control a single-lane car park passage with traffic lights, using photoelectric sensors to detect vehicle entry/exit and prevent collisions by enforcing one-way traffic via red/green light logic.  

*(Focus: Sensor-driven traffic light control for bidirectional vehicle flow in confined spaces, prioritizing collision avoidance.)*

### Prompt:
**Conveyor Belt Control Using 61131-3 Structured Text:**

Write a self-contained 61131-3 structured text program (not a function block) to control a conveyor belt system with three stations, where each station allows a user to stop the conveyor. The system should automatically start and stop based on input from five sensors that detect the presence of objects on the conveyor. The conveyor belt speed must be maintained at 2 meters per second. The program should manage both manual and automatic control modes while ensuring safe and efficient operation.

Implement logic that prioritizes safety by ensuring the conveyor stops if any station triggers a stop command or if an object is not detected by the sensors.

**B-A-B:**

ðŸŸ¥ B (Before) â€“ The Challenge

Conveyor systems in industrial settings often require dual control modesâ€”automatic (sensor-driven) and manual (station-controlled)â€”to ensure efficiency and operational safety. However, without proper programming logic, these systems risk safety breaches such as failing to stop when objects are missing or when a user issues a stop command. Additionally, maintaining a constant belt speed and handling input from multiple stations and sensors can lead to complex coordination issues in PLC programs.

ðŸŸ© A (After) â€“ The Ideal Outcome

Create a self-contained IEC 61131-3 Structured Text program (not a function block) that:
	â€¢	Controls a conveyor belt system with:
	â€¢	Three manual stations, each capable of issuing a stop command
	â€¢	Five object detection sensors, ensuring items are properly tracked
	â€¢	A fixed conveyor speed of 2 m/s
	â€¢	Operates in two modes:
	â€¢	Automatic Mode: conveyor runs only when all five sensors detect objects
	â€¢	Manual Mode: users at any station can stop the belt at any time
	â€¢	Includes priority safety logic:
	â€¢	The conveyor must stop if any manual stop is triggered
	â€¢	The conveyor must also stop if any sensor fails to detect an object
	â€¢	Ensures smooth operation with:
	â€¢	Clear mode switching logic
	â€¢	Accurate status management for the conveyor motor
	â€¢	Simple scalability if additional sensors or stations are added

ðŸŸ§ B (Bridge) â€“ The Implementation Strategy

To achieve this:
	1.	Declare variables:
 VAR
    Sensor1, Sensor2, Sensor3, Sensor4, Sensor5 : BOOL;
    StationStop1, StationStop2, StationStop3 : BOOL;
    ManualMode, AutoMode : BOOL;
    ConveyorRunning : BOOL;
    ConveyorSpeed : REAL := 2.0; // m/s
END_VAR
	2.	Write logic to prioritize safety and manage control modes:
 // Manual Stop Check
IF StationStop1 OR StationStop2 OR StationStop3 THEN
    ConveyorRunning := FALSE;
// Auto Mode Logic
ELSIF AutoMode THEN
    IF Sensor1 AND Sensor2 AND Sensor3 AND Sensor4 AND Sensor5 THEN
        ConveyorRunning := TRUE;
    ELSE
        ConveyorRunning := FALSE;
    END_IF;
// Manual Mode Logic (override sensors)
ELSIF ManualMode THEN
    ConveyorRunning := TRUE;
END_IF;
	3.	Document assumptions:
	â€¢	Only one mode active at a time
	â€¢	Speed is fixed and does not require adjustment
	â€¢	Manual stop overrides all other logic immediately

This approach ensures the conveyor system responds appropriately in real time, supports dual control modes, and meets safety requirements with a readable and modifiable code structure.
