### Intent:
**Intent Summary:**  
Develop an IEC 61131-3 structured text function block (`CAN_REGISTER_COBID`) to dynamically register/deregister CANOpen PDOs (by COBID) with error handling, buffer management, and support for clearing all registrations when COBID=0, ensuring robust runtime communication in industrial automation systems.  

*(Focus: Modular COBID management, fault tolerance, and memory safety for CANOpen networks.)*

### Prompt:
**CANOpen PDO Registration Using 61131-3 Structured Text:**

Develop a structured text (ST) function block named CAN_REGISTER_COBID based on IEC 61131 standards. The block will be responsible for registering or deleting a PDO (Process Data Object) or CAN Layer 2 message for reception by the network layer. When the REGISTER input is set to TRUE, the specified COBID (CAN identifier) will be registered for receiving messages. If REGISTER is set to FALSE, the registration of the respective COBID will be deleted. Additionally, when REGISTER is FALSE and COBID is set to 0, all registrations and messages stored in the network layer buffer will be cleared. Discuss the function blockâ€™s implementation, including error handling, network communication management, and memory buffer clearing mechanisms.

**C-A-R-E:**

ðŸŸ¥ C (Context) â€“ The Background

In industrial automation systems using CANOpen, itâ€™s essential to manage the registration and deregistration of Process Data Objects (PDOs) and CAN Layer 2 messages efficiently. Without a structured approach, communication reliability suffers, and issues like memory overflow, improper message handling, or difficult debugging can occurâ€”especially when dealing with dynamic message configurations at runtime.

ðŸŸ© A (Action) â€“ The Implementation Task

Develop a Structured Text (ST) function block named CAN_REGISTER_COBID according to IEC 61131-3 standards. The function block should register a COBID for message reception when REGISTER is TRUE, and remove the registration when REGISTER is FALSE. If REGISTER is FALSE and COBID = 0, all COBIDs should be deregistered, and the network layer buffer should be cleared. The implementation must include error detection (e.g., duplicate registration, invalid COBID), memory buffer clearing logic, and safe handling of network communication.

ðŸŸ¨ R (Result) â€“ The Intended Outcome

This function block will provide a reusable and modular way to manage CAN message registration, enhance communication robustness, prevent memory issues, and ensure that dynamic registration and deregistration operations can be handled safely at runtime with appropriate feedback and fault reporting.

ðŸŸ¦ E (Example) â€“ Practical Use Case

For example, during a recipe change in a machine, the system needs to listen to a different set of PDOs. Setting REGISTER := FALSE with a specific COBID allows deregistration of old messages. Setting REGISTER := TRUE with a new COBID registers the new messages. If the operator aborts the batch process, setting COBID := 0 and REGISTER := FALSE clears all registrations and resets the communication buffer, preparing the system for a fresh start.
