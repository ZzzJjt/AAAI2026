### Intent:
The task is to create a detailed control narrative for the fermentation stage of ethanol production, specifying automation logic, setpoints, instrumentation, and safety interlocks to guide PLC programming and process operation.

### Prompt:
**SFC Traffic Light:**

Create a 61131-3 sequential function chart in ASCII art for a traffic light. Include proper delays for switching the lights.

**B-A-B:**

ðŸŸ¥ B (Before) â€“ The Problem or Challenge

When designing a traffic light control system using IEC 61131-3, itâ€™s important to clearly represent the sequential logic of light transitions (green â†’ yellow â†’ red â†’ green) with appropriate timing delays. In situations where graphical tools are not availableâ€”such as for documentation, version control, or early-stage logic planningâ€”engineers need a way to express Sequential Function Charts (SFCs) using plain-text or ASCII art. Without a structured textual layout, the sequence flow and timing logic can become confusing or miscommunicated.

â¸»

ðŸŸ© A (After) â€“ The Desired Outcome

Create a Sequential Function Chart (SFC) in ASCII art that models the behavior of a standard traffic light system. The chart should:
	â€¢	Follow IEC 61131-3 syntax and logic structure
	â€¢	Include steps for Green, Yellow, and Red lights
	â€¢	Use transitions between steps with clear conditions
	â€¢	Implement delays/timers between transitions (e.g., 5s green, 2s yellow, 5s red)
	â€¢	Be clearly formatted to show the flow from one step to the next in a loop

â¸»

ðŸŸ§ B (Bridge) â€“ How to Get There
	1.	Define three steps: S1: Green, S2: Yellow, S3: Red
	2.	Place transitions between steps with timing conditions such as T#5s or tGreen.Q
	3.	Format the diagram using ASCII blocks for clarity, for example:

 +------------+     tGreen.Q     +-------------+     tYellow.Q     +-----------+
| Green Light|---------------->| Yellow Light|------------------>| Red Light |
|  TON: tGreen                  |  TON: tYellow                 |  TON: tRed |
+------------+                 +-------------+                 +-----------+
        ^                                                                 |
        |                                                                 |
        +-----------------------------------------------------------------+
                         tRed.Q (after 5s)

### Generated Code:
The task is to create a detailed control narrative for the fermentation stage of ethanol production, specifying automation logic, setpoints, instrumentation, and safety interlocks to guide PLC programming and process operation.

**R-I-S-E:**

ðŸŸ¥ R (Role) â€“ Your Role

You are a PLC programmer or control systems engineer responsible for documenting or communicating the logic of a traffic light control system using IEC 61131-3 standards.

ðŸŸ© I (Input) â€“ What Youâ€™re Given

You need to express the logic of a traffic light system in a way that:
	â€¢	Is machine-readable for PLC implementation
	â€¢	Is human-readable for documentation or version control
	â€¢	Includes the proper delays and transitions between light states

ðŸŸ§ S (Steps) â€“ How to Do It

	1.	Define the steps of the traffic light sequence (Green â†’ Yellow â†’ Red â†’ Green).
	2.	Assign a timer to each step to control the duration of each light.
	3.	Use ASCII characters to create a flow diagram that visually represents the transitions between steps.
	4.	Ensure the logic is structured in a way that follows IEC 61131-3 standards for clarity and maintainability.
