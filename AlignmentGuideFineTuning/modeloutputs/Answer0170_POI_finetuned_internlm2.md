### Intent:
**Intent Summary:**  
Create a self-contained, iterative Quicksort function block in IEC 61131-3 Structured Text for PLCs, using stack emulation to avoid recursion while sorting arrays in-place with configurable execution control and state tracking.  

*(Focus: Non-recursive, scan-cycle-safe sorting for industrial automation.)*

### Prompt:
**Timer:**
Implement a self-contained function block in IEC 61131-3 structured text to create a timer. Include configurable time duration, start/stop controls, and timeout handling.

**B-A-B:**

ðŸŸ¥ B (Before) â€“ The Problem or Challenge

Timers are essential in industrial automation for sequencing operations, delays, and safety checks. However, relying on fixed or external timers can limit flexibility and reusability. A timer that lacks configurable duration, start/stop control, or timeout indication can lead to rigid control logic and poor maintainability in PLC systems.

ðŸŸ© A (After) â€“ The Desired Outcome

Develop a self-contained function block in IEC 61131-3 Structured Text that acts as a flexible timer. The function block should:
	â€¢	Allow users to configure the time duration
	â€¢	Support Start and Stop signals for runtime control
	â€¢	Track elapsed time and indicate when the timer has timed out
	â€¢	Provide output flags for Running, Done, and optionally RemainingTime

â¸»

ðŸŸ§ B (Bridge) â€“ How to Get There
	1.	Define the function block with inputs:
	â€¢	Start : BOOL
	â€¢	Stop : BOOL
	â€¢	PresetTime : TIME
	2.	Use internal variables to:
	â€¢	Store StartTime and ElapsedTime
	â€¢	Reset when Stop = TRUE
	â€¢	Accumulate time only when Start = TRUE and Stop = FALSE
	3.	Provide outputs:
	â€¢	Running : BOOL â€“ active while the timer is counting
	â€¢	Done : BOOL â€“ TRUE when elapsed time â‰¥ preset time
	â€¢	RemainingTime : TIME â€“ optional, shows remaining time until done
	4.	Ensure the timer is scan-cycle safe, reusable, and well-commented

**C-A-R-E:**

ðŸŸ¥ C (Context) â€“ The Situation

In industrial automation, precise timing is crucial for coordinating processes and ensuring safety. However, traditional timer implementations in PLCs can be inflexible and difficult to reuse. A self-contained function block that allows users to configure the timer duration and control its start and stop would improve flexibility and maintainability in control logic.

ðŸŸ© A (Action) â€“ The Actions Taken

To create a self-contained timer function block in IEC 61131-3 Structured Text, follow these steps:

1.	Define the function block with inputs:
	â€¢	Start : BOOL â€“ Start the timer
	â€¢	Stop : BOOL â€“ Stop the timer
	â€¢	PresetTime : TIME â€“ The desired duration of the timer

2.	Use internal variables to track the timer state:
	â€¢	Store StartTime and ElapsedTime as TIME variables
	â€¢	Reset StartTime and ElapsedTime when Stop = TRUE
	â€¢	Accumulate ElapsedTime only when Start = TRUE and Stop = FALSE

3.	Provide outputs:
	â€¢	Running : BOOL â€“ TRUE while the timer is counting
	â€¢	Done : BOOL â€“ TRUE when ElapsedTime â‰¥ PresetTime
	â€¢	RemainingTime : TIME â€“ Optional, shows remaining time until Done

4.	Ensure the function block is self-contained, reusable, and well-commented for clarity.

ðŸŸ© R (Result) â€“ The Results

By implementing a self-contained timer function block in IEC 61131-3 Structured Text, you can create a flexible and reusable timer that can be easily integrated into control logic. The timer allows users to configure the duration, start and stop the timer, and track elapsed time and remaining time. This approach improves flexibility, maintainability, and reduces the need for external timers in PLC systems.
