ðŸŸ© I (Input) â€“ Information Provided

You are to build a function block that:
	â€¢	Accepts a temperature value in Fahrenheit
	â€¢	Converts it to Celsius using the standard formula
	â€¢	Includes input validation to reject values below absolute zero (âˆ’459.67Â°F)
	â€¢	Returns the Celsius temperature and a boolean flag indicating input validity
	â€¢	Ensures safety and accuracy during execution in scan-cycle-sensitive PLC environments

ðŸŸ© E (Explanation) â€“ Explanation of the Function Block

The function block `FahrenheitToCelsius` takes a temperature value in Fahrenheit as input and outputs the corresponding Celsius temperature and a boolean flag indicating whether the input is valid.

1. The function block first checks if the input Fahrenheit temperature is greater than or equal to -459.67Â°F. If it is, the function block proceeds to perform the conversion.
2. If the input temperature is below this threshold, the function block sets the Celsius output to 0.0 and the ValidInput flag to FALSE, indicating that the input is invalid.
3. The conversion is performed using the standard formula for Fahrenheit to Celsius: Celsius = (Fahrenheit - 32) \* 5 / 9.
4. The function block includes inline comments to explain each step of the process and to ensure that the code is self-explanatory.
5. The function block is designed to be robust and can handle edge cases, such as extremely low temperatures, without causing any issues.

The function block can be easily integrated into other PLC programs and can be used for various purposes, such as displaying temperature values in the HMI, logging temperature data, or controlling temperature-based processes in industrial automation systems.
