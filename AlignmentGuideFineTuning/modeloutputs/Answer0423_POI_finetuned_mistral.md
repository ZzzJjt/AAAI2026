### Intent:
**Intent Summary:**  
Develop a MATLAB-based MPC controller for a distillation column that optimizes feed rates and temperature dynamics while adhering to operational constraints, without generating visual outputs.  

**Alternative (for the After code):**  
Implement a tank level MPC controller in Python that handles delayed feed inputs and stochastic demand while maintaining level constraints, outputting numerical performance metrics.  

Choose the first summary if referring to the original distillation task, or the second if describing the After code's storage tank control scenario. Both capture the core control objective and implementation constraints.

### Prompt:
**MATLAB Distillation Column Modeling and Control:**

Develop MATLAB code for a mathematical model of a distillation column, capturing its dynamic relationships between feed rates and temperature. Avoid plotting results.
Implement a model predictive control (MPC) scheme using the developed model to optimize the distillation process while considering operational constraints.

**R-I-S-E:**

ðŸŸ¥ Rï¼ˆRoleï¼‰

Act as a process control engineer using MATLAB to model and optimize the operation of distillation columns.

ðŸŸ© Iï¼ˆInputï¼‰

You are given the task of modeling a distillation column with dynamic interactions between feed rates and temperature. Operational constraints must be considered, and graphical plotting of results is not required.

ðŸŸ§ Sï¼ˆStepsï¼‰
	1.	Develop a mathematical model in MATLAB that captures the dynamic relationship between feed rates and column temperatureâ€”using differential equations or a state-space representation.
	2.	Implement a model predictive control (MPC) algorithm based on the developed model.
	3.	Encode the control logic to handle system constraints such as maximum and minimum allowable temperatures, flow rates, and composition targets.
	4.	Focus on numerical outputs and control actions without generating any plots or visualizations.

ðŸŸ¦ Eï¼ˆExpectationï¼‰

The MATLAB code should produce a reliable, simulation-ready model and MPC strategy that optimizes the distillation process, ensuring constraint compliance and improved efficiencyâ€”all through data computation, not visual analysis.
