### Intent:
The task is to **develop a cascade control system in IEC 61131-3 Structured Text that regulates a heat exchanger's outlet temperature using an outer temperature loop (PI control) and an inner flow control loop (PI control), with safety limits and real-time adjustments**.  

*(Key focus: temperature-flow cascade control, PI logic, output clamping, and process safety.)*

### Prompt:
**PID pH Control:**

Develop a self-contained IEC 61131-3 Structured Text program (not a function block) to implement PID feedback control for pH regulation in a process. The program should continuously adjust the addition of acid or base to maintain the pH setpoint, ensuring accurate control in dynamic conditions.

Include the PID parameters (proportional, integral, and derivative gains) and the control logic to handle deviations from the target pH. The program should incorporate safeguards to prevent extreme pH levels by setting operational limits for the dosing mechanism. Discuss the challenges of pH control in industrial processes, particularly focusing on system response time, non-linear behavior of pH control, and maintaining process stability under varying input conditions.

**B-A-B:**

🟥 B (Before) – The Challenge

In industrial chemical processes, pH control is notoriously difficult due to its nonlinear response, especially near neutral values. Small additions of acid or base can result in large swings in pH. Without proper control, the system may experience instability, corrosion, or product quality issues. Manual adjustment or poorly tuned control loops can result in process inefficiencies and safety hazards.

🟩 A (After) – The Ideal Outcome

Develop a self-contained IEC 61131-3 Structured Text program that:
	•	Implements PID feedback control to maintain the pH of the process fluid at a specified setpoint
	•	Dynamically adjusts acid or base dosing in real time
	•	Utilizes tuned PID gains (proportional, integral, derivative) to respond effectively to disturbances
	•	Clamps the dosing output within predefined limits to prevent overcorrection and maintain safety
	•	Provides stable and precise pH regulation, even under variable process conditions

🟧 B (Bridge) – The Implementation Strategy

Use the following Structured Text code to implement the pH control logic:

VAR
    pH_PV : REAL;                     // Measured pH value
    pH_SP : REAL := 7.0;              // Target pH setpoint

    // PID gains
    Kp : REAL := 2.5;
    Ki : REAL := 0.6;
    Kd : REAL := 0.3;

    // PID internals
    Error : REAL;
    Prev_Error : REAL := 0.0;
    Integral : REAL := 0.0;
    Derivative : REAL;
    Dosing_Output : REAL;

    // Dosing limits (acid/base pump output %)
    Dosing_Min : REAL := 0.0;
    Dosing_Max : REAL := 100.0;
END_VAR

// PID loop (sampled every 100 ms)
Error := pH_SP - pH_PV;
Integral := Integral + Error * 0.1;
Derivative := (Error - Prev_Error) / 0.1;

Dosing_Output := (Kp * Error) + (Ki * Integral) + (Kd * Derivative);

// Clamp output to safe dosing range
IF Dosing_Output > Dosing_Max THEN
    Dosing_Output := Dosing_Max;
ELSIF Dosing_Output < Dosing_Min THEN
    Dosing_Output := Dosing_Min;
END_IF

Prev_Error := Error;
