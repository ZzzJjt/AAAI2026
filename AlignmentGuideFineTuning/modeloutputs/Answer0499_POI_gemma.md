### Intent:
**Intent Summary:**  
Create a reusable IEC 61131-3 Structured Text function block to compute the sine of an angle (in radians) efficiently, either using built-in `SIN()` or a Taylor series approximation, with considerations for real-time PLC constraints, precision, and documentation.  

*(Focus: Modular sine computation for industrial automation, balancing accuracy and performance.)*

### Prompt:
**Sine Function**

Develop a self-contained function block in IEC 61131-3 Structured Text to compute the sine of a given angle in radians. Ensure that the function block is modular and reusable, with appropriate comments detailing the mathematical operations involved. Include a discussion on the precision of the sine function within the context of PLC programming and its potential limitations in real-time applications.

ðŸŸ¥ R (Role) â€“ Your Role

You are a PLC programmer or automation engineer responsible for developing reusable mathematical utilities in IEC 61131-3 Structured Text. Your objective is to implement a real-time-capable trigonometric function block to compute the sine of a given angle, supporting motion control or waveform modeling tasks in industrial systems.

â¸»

ðŸŸ© I (Input) â€“ What Youâ€™re Given

You need to build a function block that:
	â€¢	Accepts an input:
	â€¢	AngleRad : REAL â€” the input angle in radians
	â€¢	Returns an output:
	â€¢	SineValue : REAL â€” the calculated sine of the angle
	â€¢	Should work even in systems that do not support built-in SIN()
	â€¢	Must execute efficiently within a PLC scan cycle and handle rounding/precision issues appropriately

â¸»

ðŸŸ§ S (Steps) â€“ What You Need to Do
	1.	Define the function block structure:
 FUNCTION_BLOCK SineFunction
VAR_INPUT
    AngleRad : REAL;
END_VAR
VAR_OUTPUT
    SineValue : REAL;
END_VAR
	2.	Implement the core logic using one of two approaches:
	â€¢	If the platform supports it:
 SineValue := SIN(AngleRad);
 â€¢	If not, use a Taylor series approximation:
 VAR
    x, x2, x3, x5, x7 : REAL;
END_VAR
x := AngleRad;
x2 := x * x;
x3 := x2 * x;
x5 := x3 * x2;
x7 := x5 * x2;
SineValue := x - (x3 / 6.0) + (x5 / 120.0) - (x7 / 5040.0);
3.	Add inline comments:
	â€¢	State the formula used and assumptions (e.g., radians, approximation terms)
	â€¢	Note that the series works best near 0 and may require input normalization
	â€¢	Warn of performance/accuracy trade-offs in long-running loops or real-time control
	4.	Optional: Normalize large angles to the range [-Ï€, Ï€] to improve accuracy

ðŸŸ¦ E (Expectation) â€“ What Success Looks Like

You deliver a modular and reusable function block that:
	â€¢	Computes the sine of a given angle accurately
	â€¢	Can be deployed in real-time applications like:
	â€¢	Oscillatory actuator control
	â€¢	Simulated waveforms
	â€¢	Robot trajectory smoothing
	â€¢	Runs predictably within scan time constraints
	â€¢	Includes clear documentation, making it easy for others to understand, modify, and extend
