### Intent:
**Intent Summary:**  
Develop Python code to implement model predictive control (MPC) for optimizing robot movement, ensuring smooth, adaptive path planning with obstacle avoidance and dynamic constraints in real time.

### Prompt:
**Model Predictive Control for Optimizing Robot Movement Using Python:**

Develop Python code to implement a model predictive control (MPC) algorithm for optimizing the movement of a robot. The control system should consider dynamic constraints, path planning, and obstacle avoidance while ensuring smooth, efficient, and adaptive movement in a dynamic environment.

**B-A-B:**

ðŸŸ¥ Bï¼ˆBeforeï¼‰

Traditional robot motion planning algorithms often struggle to balance smoothness, efficiency, and real-time adaptability, especially in environments with dynamic constraints and obstacles. This can lead to jerky movement, inefficient paths, or even collisions in fast-changing scenarios.

ðŸŸ© Aï¼ˆAfterï¼‰

Use model predictive control (MPC) to enable a robot to move smoothly, efficiently, and adaptively in real time. The robot should be able to plan its path, avoid obstacles, and respect motion constraintsâ€”ensuring safe and optimal performance in dynamic environments.

ðŸŸ§ Bï¼ˆBridgeï¼‰

Develop Python code to simulate the robotâ€™s motion environment and implement an MPC algorithm that continuously updates the control strategy based on predicted future states. Integrate dynamic constraints, obstacle positions, and path targets to demonstrate how MPC enables the robot to react intelligently and maintain optimal movement.
