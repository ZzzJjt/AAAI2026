### Intent:
**Intent Summary:**  
Develop an IEC 61131-3 Structured Text program to implement PID-based temperature control for a gas turbine, maintaining a stable setpoint (950°C) via valve adjustment while ensuring safety limits and anti-windup protection.

### Prompt:
**Cascade Control Oil Refinery:**

Develop a self-contained IEC 61131-3 Structured Text program (not a function block) to implement cascade control for pressure regulation in an oil refinery vessel. The primary loop should control the vessel pressure, adjusting the pressure setpoint based on the process requirements. The secondary loop controls the flow of oil into the vessel, with the output of the primary loop serving as the setpoint for the secondary loop.

Ensure that the program manages the interaction between the two control loops, allowing the inner loop (oil flow control) to respond rapidly to changes in flow while the outer loop (pressure control) maintains overall process stability. Include typical parameter values for pressure and flow control, and discuss the benefits of cascade control in oil refinery operations, particularly for improving response time and process stability in systems with large disturbances.

**B-A-B:**

🟥 B (Before) – The Challenge

In oil refinery vessels, maintaining stable pressure is crucial for safety and process efficiency. However, disturbances such as fluctuations in oil inflow or demand shifts can cause rapid changes that single-loop control systems cannot respond to effectively. These systems often struggle with slow response times and overshooting, especially in processes with large time constants and disturbances.

🟩 A (After) – The Ideal Outcome

Design a self-contained Structured Text program (not a function block) using IEC 61131-3 that:
	•	Implements cascade control for a refinery vessel:
	•	Outer loop (primary): Controls vessel pressure based on a setpoint.
	•	Inner loop (secondary): Regulates oil inflow rate using the outer loop’s output as its setpoint.
	•	Ensures the inner loop responds quickly to flow disturbances, while the outer loop maintains long-term pressure stability.
	•	Includes typical parameter values such as:
	•	Pressure_SP := 12.0 bar, Kp_Outer := 1.2, Kp_Inner := 2.5
	•	Improves process stability and responsiveness in dynamic refinery conditions.

🟧 B (Bridge) – The Implementation Strategy

You can structure the cascade control logic like this:
VAR
    // Outer loop: Pressure control
    Pressure_SP : REAL := 12.0;     // Desired pressure (bar)
    Pressure_PV : REAL;             // Measured pressure
    Pressure_Error : REAL;
    Flow_SP : REAL;

    // Inner loop: Flow control
    Flow_PV : REAL;                 // Measured oil flow
    Flow_Error : REAL;
    Flow_Output : REAL;

    // Controller gains
    Kp_Outer : REAL := 1.2;
    Kp_Inner : REAL := 2.5;
END_VAR

// Outer loop logic
Pressure_Error := Pressure_SP - Pressure_PV;
Flow_SP := Kp_Outer * Pressure_Error;  // Outer loop drives flow setpoint

// Inner loop logic
Flow_Error := Flow_SP - Flow_PV;
Flow_Output := Kp_Inner * Flow_Error;  // Flow output controls oil valve

This solution allows:
	•	Fast inner-loop response to flow variations
	•	Stable outer-loop control of pressure
	•	Improved control in refinery environments with high inertia and frequent load changes

TITLE 'Gas Turbine Temperature Control – PID'

(*
    Description:
    Implements a PID control loop for maintaining a stable temperature (950°C) in a gas turbine.

    Features:
    - Maintains a stable temperature setpoint (950°C)
    - Uses PID control to adjust valve position based on deviation from setpoint
    - Includes anti-windup protection to prevent overshoot and overshooting
    - Safety limits for temperature and valve position
    - Modular structure for easy integration and tuning

    Safety:
    - Valve position is clamped between 0% and 100%
    - Temperature is clamped between 800°C and 1050°C
    - PID gains are tuned for stability and response

    I/O:
    - Temp_PV: Measured turbine temperature (°C)
    - Temp_SP: Target temperature (°C)
    - Valve_Position: Output to control turbine inlet valve (0% to 100%)

    Algorithm:
    1. Compute error: Error = Temp_SP - Temp_PV
    2. Update integral: Integral = Integral + Error * dt
    3. Clamp output: Limit Valve_Position to 0% to 100%
    4. Apply output to valve

    PID Parameters:
    - Kp: 2.0 (proportional gain)
    - Ki: 0.5 (integral gain)
    - Kd: 0.1 (derivative gain)
    - Sample time: 100 ms
