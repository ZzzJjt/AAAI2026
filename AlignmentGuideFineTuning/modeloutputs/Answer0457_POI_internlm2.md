### Prompt:
**OPC UA Client Implementation Using C and IEC 61131-3 Structured Text:**

Develop C-code for an OPC UA client, then wrap it into an IEC 61131-based function block written in structured text (ST). The function block should have the following input pins: Execute (type: BOOL), ServerUrl (type: STRING[255]), and Timeout (type: TIME). The output pins should include Done (type: BOOL), Busy (type: BOOL), Error (type: BOOL), and ErrorID (type: DWORD). In your explanation, describe how the C-code interfaces with the OPC UA server, how the function block manages communication with the server, and how error handling is implemented. Provide details on how to integrate this function block within an IEC 61131-3 environment for reliable client-server communication.

ðŸŸ¥ R (Role) â€“ Your Role

Act as a systems integration engineer working with C and IEC 61131-3 Structured Text (ST) to embed OPC UA client functionality into a PLC environment.

ðŸŸ© I (Input) â€“ What Youâ€™re Given

You need to implement an OPC UA client in C and make it available in a PLC program through a function block written in Structured Text. The function block should expose the following interface:

Inputs:

	â€¢	Execute (BOOL): Starts the OPC UA connection process
	â€¢	ServerUrl (STRING[255]): The OPC UA server address
	â€¢	Timeout (TIME): Maximum duration to wait for a response

Outputs:

	â€¢	Done (BOOL): Set to TRUE when the operation completes successfully
	â€¢	Busy (BOOL): TRUE while the operation is ongoing
	â€¢	Error (BOOL): Set if the connection fails
	â€¢	ErrorID (DWORD): Contains an error code for diagnosis

Additionally, the implementation must include robust error handling, proper session management, and seamless integration between C and the ST environment.

ðŸŸ§ S (Steps) â€“ What You Need to Do

	1.	Write C-code for the OPC UA client using a suitable library (e.g., open62541) to manage server connection, session creation, and error handling.
	2.	Create a C interface (DLL or static library) that exposes functions callable from IEC 61131-3 ST environments.
	3.	Implement an ST function block that calls these C functions, controls the connection lifecycle using Execute and Timeout, and sets the appropriate output flags (Done, Busy, Error, ErrorID).
	4.	Ensure rising-edge detection on Execute, prevent blocking behavior, and handle timeouts and connection errors with meaningful codes.

ðŸŸ¦ E (Expectation) â€“ What Success Looks Like

The resulting solution enables the PLC to initiate OPC UA client sessions in a non-blocking, deterministic manner. It provides reliable communication with OPC UA servers, with clear status reporting and error trackingâ€”making it suitable for use in real-time industrial control environments.

ðŸŸ¨ S (Solution) â€“ How to Approach It

1. **Write C-code for the OPC UA Client:**
	- Choose a suitable OPC UA library, such as open62541, and familiarize yourself with its API.
	- Implement the OPC UA client functionality in C, including connection management, session creation, and error handling.
	- Ensure that the C-code is thread-safe and can handle multiple concurrent requests.
	- Use appropriate error codes and messages to provide meaningful feedback on connection failures.

2. **Create a C Interface:**
	- Expose the OPC UA client functions as a C interface (DLL or static library).
	- Define function prototypes for the OPC UA client functions, including input and output parameters.
	- Implement the C interface to ensure seamless integration with the IEC 61131-3 environment.

3. **Implement the ST Function Block:**
	- Create a new function block in Structured Text with the required input and output pins.
	- Implement the function block logic to call the C functions exposed by the interface.
	- Use the Execute input pin to control the OPC UA client lifecycle, and the Timeout input pin to set the maximum duration for a response.
	- Set the appropriate output pins (Done, Busy, Error, ErrorID) based on the results of the C functions.

4. **Ensure Non-Blocking Behavior and Error Handling:**
	- Implement rising-edge detection on the Execute input pin to prevent blocking behavior.
	- Handle timeouts and connection errors by setting the Error and ErrorID output pins appropriately.
	- Use meaningful error codes and messages to provide clear feedback on connection failures.

5. **Integrate the Function Block into an IEC 61131-3 Program:**
	- Place the function block in the appropriate program section (e.g., a main program or a function block program).
	- Connect the function block to other elements in the program as needed.
	- Test the integration to ensure reliable communication between the PLC and the OPC UA server.
