ðŸŸ§ E (Example) â€“ A Practical Illustration

**Function Block:** SIN

**Functional Description:** Generates a sinusoidal waveform based on the input angle (in radians) and amplitude.

**Typical Use Case:** Generating a waveform for motor control, signal modulation, or process simulation.

**Categorization:** Trigonometric Functions

**Optional Notes:** The input angle should be in the range [0, 2Ï€] for a complete cycle. The output is scaled between -1 and 1, representing the sine of the input angle.

**Function Block:** MEAN_ARRAY

**Functional Description:** Calculates the mean value of an array of numbers.

**Typical Use Case:** Smoothing process data, calculating average values, or implementing quality control checks.

**Categorization:** Statistical Calculations

**Optional Notes:** The input array should contain at least one element. The output is the sum of all
