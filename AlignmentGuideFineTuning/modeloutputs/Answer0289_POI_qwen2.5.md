### Intent:
**Intent Summary:**  
Develop a structured text program to control a coffee machine's automated process, managing valves and mixer operations through state transitions while ensuring emergency stop functionality and proper ingredient dispensing.

### Prompt:
**Pneumatic System Control Using 61131-3 Structured Text:**

Write a self-contained 61131-3 structured text program (not a function block) to control a pneumatic system with a control loop frequency of 100 ms. The system should regulate the flow of air to actuators based on input signals, maintaining a flow rate of 50 standard liters per minute. The system must also ensure that the pressure remains within the specified range of 5.5 to 6 bar. Implement safety checks to handle any deviations in flow or pressure and ensure efficient and reliable operation under varying load conditions.

**C-A-R-E:**

ðŸŸ¥ C (Context) â€“ The Background

In pneumatic automation systems, precise flow and pressure control is essential to ensure reliable actuator performance and energy efficiency. Industrial applications often require real-time responsiveness, flow rate stability, and safety enforcement. Implementing this in a PLC with IEC 61131-3 Structured Text allows for scalable, deterministic control across varying load conditions.

ðŸŸ© A (Action) â€“ The Implementation Task

Develop a self-contained Structured Text (ST) program that:
	â€¢	Executes every 100 milliseconds (100 ms loop frequency)
	â€¢	Regulates airflow to a setpoint of 50 standard liters per minute (SLPM)
	â€¢	Monitors pressure to ensure it stays between 5.5 and 6.0 bar
	â€¢	Includes safety mechanisms that:
	â€¢	Detect and respond to over/under pressure
	â€¢	Handle abnormal flow deviations
	â€¢	Activates relevant outputs such as:
	â€¢	A flow valve actuator
	â€¢	A pressure relief valve
	â€¢	Error flags for fault diagnostics

â¸»

ðŸŸ¨ R (Result) â€“ The Expected Outcome

The resulting program will:
	â€¢	Maintain stable flow to meet actuator requirements
	â€¢	Ensure operational safety by preventing pressure-related faults
	â€¢	Trigger alerts or shutoffs when unsafe conditions are detected
	â€¢	Operate reliably across varying loads and environmental conditions
	â€¢	Be suitable for integration into larger industrial automation systems

    FlowInput : REAL;               // Flow rate in SLPM
    PressureInput : REAL;           // Pressure in bar
    FlowSetpoint : REAL := 50.0;    // Target flow rate

    MaxPressure : REAL := 6.0;

    FlowValveOutput : BOOL := FALSE;
    PressureReliefValve : BOOL := FALSE;
    FlowError : BOOL := FALSE;
    PressureError : BOOL := FALSE;
END_VAR

// Flow Control Logic
IF FlowInput < FlowSetpoint THEN
    FlowValveOutput := TRUE;  // Open valve to increase flow
ELSIF FlowInput >= FlowSetpoint THEN
    FlowValveOutput := FALSE; // Maintain or close
END_IF

// Pressure Monitoring and Protection
IF PressureInput < MinPressure OR PressureInput > MaxPressure THEN
    PressureError := TRUE;
    PressureReliefValve := TRUE;  // Activate safety
ELSE
    PressureError := FALSE;
    PressureReliefValve := FALSE;
END_IF

// Flow Deviation Check
IF ABS(FlowInput - FlowSetpoint) > 5.0 THEN
    FlowError := TRUE;
ELSE
    FlowError := FALSE;

This structured text program is designed to control a pneumatic system, ensuring that the flow rate is maintained at 50 SLPM and that the pressure remains within the safe range of 5.5 to 6.0 bar. It includes safety mechanisms to detect and respond to over/under pressure and abnormal flow deviations, triggering appropriate outputs and error flags for fault diagnostics. The program is intended to be integrated into larger industrial automation systems and is suitable for real-time, deterministic control under varying load conditions.
