### Intent:
**Intent Summary:**  
Develop an IEC 61131-3 Structured Text PID controller to regulate pH by dynamically adjusting acid/base dosing within safe limits, addressing nonlinearity and ensuring stability in industrial processes.  

*(Focus: PID control, pH regulation, safety constraints, nonlinear behavior handling)*

### Prompt:
**PID pH Control:**

Develop a self-contained IEC 61131-3 Structured Text program (not a function block) to implement PID feedback control for pH regulation in a process. The program should continuously adjust the addition of acid or base to maintain the pH setpoint, ensuring accurate control in dynamic conditions.

Include the PID parameters (proportional, integral, and derivative gains) and the control logic to handle deviations from the target pH. The program should incorporate safeguards to prevent extreme pH levels by setting operational limits for the dosing mechanism. Discuss the challenges of pH control in industrial processes, particularly focusing on system response time, non-linear behavior of pH control, and maintaining process stability under varying input conditions.
