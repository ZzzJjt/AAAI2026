### Intent:
**Intent Summary:**  
Create a structured text function block that reliably computes the natural logarithm of a real-valued input for PLC applications, with robust error handling for invalid inputs and numerical overflow.  

*(Focus: Safety-critical numerical computation in industrial control systems)*

### Prompt:
**Eigenvalue:**

Design a self-contained function block in IEC 61131-3 Structured Text to compute the eigenvalues of a 10x10 matrix. Ensure the function block is optimized for performance and includes detailed comments to explain the steps involved in the eigenvalue calculation. Discuss potential challenges related to numerical stability, convergence, and computational efficiency when implementing this algorithm in a PLC environment, particularly for real-time applications.

ðŸŸ¥ T (Task) â€“ What You Need to Do

Develop a self-contained function block in IEC 61131-3 Structured Text that calculates the eigenvalues of a 10Ã—10 matrix for use in control or diagnostic applications on a PLC.

â¸»

ðŸŸ© A (Action) â€“ How to Do It
	1.	Create a function block named ComputeEigenvalues_10x10 that accepts a REAL[10,10] matrix as input.
	2.	Implement an iterative numerical method, such as the Power Method or a simplified QR algorithm, optimized for real-time execution.
	3.	Include output variables (e.g., EigenValues: ARRAY[1..10] OF REAL) and detailed inline comments explaining each calculation step:
	â€¢	Initialization of vectors
	â€¢	Matrix-vector multiplication
	â€¢	Normalization and convergence check
	4.	Add safeguards for:
	â€¢	Non-convergence (e.g., timeout after fixed iterations)
	â€¢	Numerical instability
	â€¢	Default/fallback outputs in case of failure
	5.	Ensure the function block is modular, efficient, and easy to test and reuse across control systems.

ðŸŸ¦ G (Goal) â€“ What You Want to Achieve

Provide a reliable, reusable function block that enables on-PLC eigenvalue computation, suitable for advanced process control, vibration analysis, or model validation. The solution should be engineered for stability, efficiency, and clarity, even within the resource constraints typical of real-time PLC environments.
