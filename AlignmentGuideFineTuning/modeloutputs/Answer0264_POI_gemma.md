### Intent:
**Intent Summary:**  
Develop a Structured Text function block to implement the Simplex method for solving linear programming problems on a PLC, addressing industrial optimization tasks (e.g., resource allocation) while accounting for PLC-specific constraints like memory and real-time execution.  

*(Focus: On-PLC LP solver for real-time optimization with clear limitations and use cases.)*

### Prompt:
**Linear Programming:**

Develop a self-contained function block in IEC 61131-3 Structured Text to solve a linear programming problem using the simplex method. Ensure the function block is designed to handle multiple constraints and objective functions, with detailed comments explaining the algorithm and each computational step. Discuss the limitations of implementing linear programming in a PLC environment, particularly with respect to memory and processing power, and provide examples of how this function block could be applied in industrial optimization scenarios.

**C-A-R-E:**
ðŸŸ¥ C (Context) â€“ The Background

Linear programming (LP) is essential in industrial optimization tasks such as resource allocation, production planning, and cost minimization. The Simplex method is a widely used algorithm for solving LP problems. However, implementing such an algorithm on a PLC platform presents challenges, including limited memory, scan-time restrictions, and lack of advanced math libraries. An efficient, self-contained function block is needed to bring optimization capabilities directly into the PLC environment.

ðŸŸ© A (Action) â€“ The Implementation Task

Develop a function block in IEC 61131-3 Structured Text named SimplexSolver, which:
	â€¢	Solves linear programming problems using the Simplex method
	â€¢	Accepts:
	â€¢	An objective function array (e.g., C: ARRAY[1..N] OF REAL)
	â€¢	A constraint matrix (e.g., A: ARRAY[1..M,1..N] OF REAL)
	â€¢	A right-hand side array (B: ARRAY[1..M] OF REAL)
	â€¢	Performs:
	â€¢	Tableau initialization
	â€¢	Pivot column/row selection
	â€¢	Row operations and basic feasible solution updates
	â€¢	Termination when optimality is reached or iteration limit is exceeded
	â€¢	Includes detailed comments at each step explaining:
	â€¢	Mathematical logic behind the pivoting and updates
	â€¢	How constraints are managed
	â€¢	How optimality is determined

Also discuss:
	â€¢	PLC-specific limitations, such as:
	â€¢	Fixed input sizes for memory safety
	â€¢	Time constraints during execution
	â€¢	Precision loss due to floating-point rounding
	â€¢	Design recommendations like:
	â€¢	Setting iteration limits
	â€¢	Returning solution status flags
	â€¢	Ensuring determinism for real-time applications

ðŸŸ¨ R (Result) â€“ The Expected Outcome

The result is a self-contained, reusable function block that enables on-PLC optimization without external servers or software. It is suitable for real-time use in industrial scenarios, such as:
	â€¢	Minimizing energy use across multiple production lines
	â€¢	Allocating materials within budget constraints
	â€¢	Balancing workloads on machinery or conveyors

The function block can be integrated into standard PLC logic, improving responsiveness, autonomy, and operational efficiency.

ðŸŸ¦ E (Example) â€“ A Practical Use Case

In a batch blending system, an engineer wants to mix three raw materials (A, B, C) to minimize cost while meeting quality constraints (e.g., minimum proportions, max totals). Using SimplexSolver, the objective function and constraints are loaded into pre-defined arrays. The function block computes the optimal blend ratio on the PLC in real time, updating actuator setpoints without requiring cloud optimization or SCADA involvement.

Example comment:
// Step 2: Select pivot column (most negative cost coefficient)
// Step 3: Select pivot row (minimum ratio of B[i] / A[i,j])
// Step 4: Normalize and update the tableau for next iteration
