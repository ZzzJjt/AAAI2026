### Intent:
**Intent Summary:**  
Develop an ISA-88-compliant batch control program in IEC 61131-3 Structured Text to automate the production of 100 kg cocoa milk, including ingredient dosing, heating (70Â°C), blending (200 RPM for 10 min), and phase transitions, while addressing scalability challenges for industrial use.  

*(Focus: Structured automation of a food production batch process with precise parameter control and modular ISA-88 design.)*

### Prompt:
**Batch Cocoa Milk:**

Create an ISA-88 batch control recipe for producing 100 kg of cocoa milk, detailing the required ingredients, including milk, water, liquid sugar, and cocoa. The equipment should consist of a mixing and blending vessel capable of stirring and heating. Specify appropriate amounts for each ingredient, as well as optimal mixing temperatures and heating times.

Write a self-contained program in IEC 61131-3 Structured Text for the sequential control of the mixing process, incorporating typical parameter values such as stirring speed, temperature control, and time duration. Ensure the program follows ISA-88 principles, with clear logic for controlling the heating and blending phases. Discuss the challenges in scaling and optimizing the control process for industrial production.

**B-A-B:**

ðŸŸ¥ B (Before) â€“ The Problem or Challenge

Producing cocoa milk in batch mode requires precise control over ingredient proportions, mixing temperature, and heating time to ensure product quality and consistency. Without a structured batch control strategy, such as ISA-88, manual or ad-hoc programming can lead to inefficiencies, difficulty scaling, and inconsistent resultsâ€”especially when transitioning to industrial-scale production.

ðŸŸ© A (After) â€“ The Desired Outcome

Develop an ISA-88-compliant batch control recipe for producing 100 kg of cocoa milk, including exact ingredient specifications for milk, water, liquid sugar, and cocoa. Implement a self-contained IEC 61131-3 Structured Text program to control the sequential mixing process, including accurate temperature control, stirring speed, and mixing duration. The control logic should clearly separate heating and blending phases, follow ISA-88 structuring principles, and be adaptable for scaling in industrial environments.

ðŸŸ§ B (Bridge) â€“ How to Get There

Begin by specifying the batch formula (e.g., 60 kg milk, 20 kg water, 15 kg liquid sugar, 5 kg cocoa), followed by defining optimal process parameters (e.g., mixing temperature of 70Â°C, stirring speed of 200 RPM for 10 minutes). Implement Structured Text logic using clearly defined control blocks or method calls to manage ingredient dosing, heating, and blending steps. Structure the logic using ISA-88 principles such as modular phases and transitions. Conclude with insights into challenges of scaling this recipe, such as maintaining heat uniformity and optimizing mixing efficiency at larger volumes.

    MixingDuration: TIME := T#10:00:00

  -- Initialize ingredients
  Ingredients.Milk := 60.0
  Ingredients.Water := 20.0
  Ingredients.LiquidSugar := 15.0
  Ingredients.Cocoa := 5.0
