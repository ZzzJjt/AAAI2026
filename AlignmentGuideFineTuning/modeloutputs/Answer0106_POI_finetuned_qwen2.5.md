### Intent:
**Intent Summary:**  
Develop an IEC 61131-3 Structured Text PID controller to regulate gas turbine temperature by adjusting an inlet valve, ensuring stability with anti-windup protection and output clamping for safe operation under dynamic conditions.

### Prompt:
**PID Level Control Distillation Column:**

Develop a self-contained IEC 61131-3 Structured Text program to implement PID feedback control for maintaining the liquid level in a distillation column. The control system should adjust the opening of an inlet valve that feeds liquid into the column based on the level setpoint.

The program should incorporate the PID parameters (proportional, integral, and derivative gains) and handle scenarios where the liquid level deviates from the setpoint. Ensure that the logic includes limits on the inlet valve position to prevent overfeeding or underfeeding the column. Discuss the importance of level control in maintaining the efficiency and stability of the distillation process, focusing on response time and control precision under varying operating conditions.

**B-A-B:**

ðŸŸ¥ B (Before) â€“ The Challenge

In distillation columns, liquid level control is vital for maintaining separation efficiency, column stability, and overall process performance. Without tight level control, overfeeding can lead to flooding, while underfeeding may cause tray drying or poor separation. Relying on manual adjustments or delayed feedback compromises operational safety and product quality.

ðŸŸ© A (After) â€“ The Ideal Outcome

Develop a self-contained IEC 61131-3 Structured Text program that:
	â€¢	Implements PID feedback control to regulate the liquid level in a distillation column.
	â€¢	Adjusts the inlet valve opening based on the difference between the measured level and a setpoint.
	â€¢	Uses tuned PID parameters (proportional, integral, and derivative gains) for accurate and responsive control.
	â€¢	Includes output clamping to prevent overfeeding or underfeeding by limiting the valve position.
	â€¢	Enables fast correction of disturbances and maintains a stable liquid level, even under fluctuating load and reflux conditions.

You can implement the PID level control in Structured Text as follows:
VAR
    // Inputs
    Level_PV : REAL;                    // Measured liquid level (%)
    Level_SP : REAL := 60.0;            // Setpoint for level (%)

    // PID tuning parameters
    Kp : REAL := 1.5;
    Ki : REAL := 0.4;
    Kd : REAL := 0.2;

    // Internal PID variables
    Error : REAL;
    Prev_Error : REAL := 0.0;
    Integral : REAL := 0.0;
    Derivative : REAL;
    Valve_Position : REAL;

    // Output limits
    Valve_Min : REAL := 0.0;
    Valve_Max : REAL := 100.0;
END_VAR

// PID calculation (assume 100 ms sample time)
Error := Level_SP - Level_PV;
Integral := Integral + Error * 0.1;
Derivative := (Error - Prev_Error) / 0.1;

Valve_Position := (Kp * Error) + (Ki * Integral) + (Kd * Derivative);

// Clamp valve output
IF Valve_Position > Valve_Max THEN
    Valve_Position := Valve_Max;
ELSIF Valve_Position < Valve_Min THEN
    Valve_Position := Valve_Min;
END_IF

Prev_Error := Error;
