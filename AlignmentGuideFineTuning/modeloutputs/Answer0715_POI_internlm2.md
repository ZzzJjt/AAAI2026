### Intent:
**Intent Summary:**  
Create an IEC 61131-3 ST function block to read five process values from an IO-Link master, including communication handling, error checking, and status reporting for each value.  

*(Key focus: IO-Link data acquisition with robust error handling and status feedback.)*

### Prompt:
**IO-Link Data Acquisition Using 61131-3 Structured Text:**

Develop a function block in structured text (ST) based on IEC 61131 standards to read five values from a remote IO-Link master. The function block should handle communication with the IO-Link master, retrieve the required process data, and provide the status of each read operation. Discuss the methodology used for error checking, status reporting, and handling of potential communication issues between the IO-Link master and the connected devices.

**R-T-F:**

ðŸŸ¥ R (Role) â€“ Your Role

Act as a PLC programmer developing communication function blocks using IEC 61131-3 Structured Text for IO-Link-based industrial systems.

ðŸŸ© T (Task) â€“ What You Need to Do

Create a function block that reads five process values from a remote IO-Link master. The block should manage communication with the IO-Link master, retrieve and store the values, and return the status of each read operation. It should also include error handling and reporting logic to deal with potential communication issues such as timeouts, invalid responses, or device errors.

ðŸŸ§ F (Format) â€“ Expected Output

Provide an IEC 61131-3 compliant ST function block that includes:
	â€¢	Inputs: read trigger, IO-Link addresses or indexes
	â€¢	Outputs: five process values and corresponding read status indicators
	â€¢	Logic for handling communication requests and parsing IO-Link responses
	â€¢	Error-checking mechanisms and status reporting per value
	â€¢	Well-commented code for easy maintenance and integration

**Additional Requirements:**

1.	Your function block should be compatible with the IEC 61131-3 ST language and follow the standard syntax and conventions.
2.	You should use appropriate data types and structures to represent the process values and their status.
3.	You should implement a timeout mechanism to handle communication delays and ensure the function block does not get stuck in a loop.
4.	You should handle potential errors such as invalid responses, device errors, or timeouts, and provide appropriate status feedback for each read operation.
5.	You should consider the possibility of multiple IO-Link masters and ensure the function block can handle switching between them.
6.	You should provide comments in your code to explain the logic and make it easier to understand and maintain.
7.	You should test your function block with different scenarios, including successful reads, timeouts, and errors, to ensure it works as expected.

**Deliverables:**

1.	IEC 61131-3 compliant ST function block code
2.	Documentation explaining the methodology used for error checking, status reporting, and communication handling
3.	Test cases and results demonstrating the function block's functionality and robustness

**Deadline:** 14 days from the start of the project

**Budget:** $500

**Additional Notes:**

-	You should have experience in IEC 61131-3 programming and IO-Link communication.
-	You should be familiar with the IO-Link protocol and its data structures.
-	You should be able to provide a clear and concise explanation of your methodology and code.
-	You should be able to test your function block thoroughly and provide evidence of its functionality and robustness.

**Please let me know if you have any questions or need further clarification. I look forward to working with you on this project.**
