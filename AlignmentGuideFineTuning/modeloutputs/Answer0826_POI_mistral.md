### Intent:
**Intent Summary:**  
Develop a PROFIBUS DPV1 diagnostic program in IEC 61131-3 Structured Text to monitor and report slave device health metrics (e.g., communication errors, hardware faults) via simulated requests and response parsing, with timeout handling and error management.

### Prompt:
**Modbus Server for Parallel Client Connections using 61131-3 Structured Text:**

Develop a self-contained 61131-3 structured text function block to implement a Modbus server capable of handling up to 10 parallel client connection requests over Modbus TCP. The server should manage Modbus requests within data ranges that map input and holding registers. The following Modbus function codes must be supported:

	â€¢	0x01: Read Coils
	â€¢	0x02: Read Discrete Inputs
	â€¢	0x03: Read Holding Registers
	â€¢	0x04: Read Input Registers
	â€¢	0x05: Write Single Coil
	â€¢	0x06: Write Single Register
	â€¢	0x0F: Write Multiple Coils
	â€¢	0x10: Write Multiple Registers
	â€¢	0x17: Read/Write Multiple Registers

In addition, describe the ReadCoils method, explaining how it processes client requests, maps coil data, and manages communication over TCP/IP.

**T-A-G:**

ðŸŸ¥ T (Task) â€“ What You Need to Do

Develop an IEC 61131-3 Structured Text (ST) function block that acts as a Modbus TCP server capable of managing up to 10 parallel client connections and supporting multiple standard Modbus function codes.

â¸»

ðŸŸ© A (Action) â€“ How to Do It

Design the function block to handle Modbus TCP communication, parse incoming requests, and execute operations based on the following supported function codes:

	â€¢	0x01: Read Coils
	â€¢	0x02: Read Discrete Inputs
	â€¢	0x03: Read Holding Registers
	â€¢	0x04: Read Input Registers
	â€¢	0x05: Write Single Coil
	â€¢	0x06: Write Single Register
	â€¢	0x0F: Write Multiple Coils
	â€¢	0x10: Write Multiple Registers
	â€¢	0x17: Read/Write Multiple Registers

Ensure that each of the 10 clients is handled independently. Implement detailed internal logic for each function code, especially ReadCoils, which should:

	â€¢	Interpret the clientâ€™s coil address request
	â€¢	Extract the appropriate bits from a coil data buffer
	â€¢	Format the data into a valid Modbus TCP response
	â€¢	Communicate the result back to the client
 
Also, include error handling for unsupported requests and connection timeouts.

ðŸŸ¦ G (Goal) â€“ What You Want to Achieve

Create a reliable, standards-compliant Modbus TCP server function block that can serve multiple clients simultaneously, support industrial communication demands, and provide accurate and fast responses to various Modbus requestsâ€”improving system scalability, robustness, and integration flexibility.

**ReadCoils Method:**

The ReadCoils method is responsible for handling client requests to read coil data from the server. Here's a high-level overview of its internal logic:

1. Parse the incoming Modbus TCP request to identify the starting address and number of coils to be read.
2. Map the requested coil addresses to the corresponding bits within a coil data buffer.
3. Extract the relevant bits from the coil data buffer based on the starting address and number of coils specified in the request.
4. Format the extracted bits into a valid Modbus TCP response, including the proper response code and data.
5. Communicate the response back to the client using the Modbus TCP protocol.

To ensure efficient and accurate data handling, it's essential to implement proper error checking and validation throughout the method. This includes verifying the requested address range, ensuring the number of coils to be read is within the buffer's limits, and managing timeouts during communication.

By following these steps, the ReadCoils method will provide a robust and reliable solution for handling coil data requests in the Modbus TCP server function block.
