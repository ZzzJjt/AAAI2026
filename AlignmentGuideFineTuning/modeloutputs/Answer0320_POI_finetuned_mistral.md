### Intent:
The task is to develop a Structured Text program for maintaining a 2:1 ratio between two reactant flows in a chemical mixing process, with real-time adjustment, input validation, alarm handling, and diagnostic logging.

### Prompt:
**Ratio Control Mixing:**

Develop a self-contained IEC 61131-3 Structured Text program (not a function block) to implement ratio control for mixing two reactants in a 2:1 ratio. The program should maintain the desired ratio between the two reactants by adjusting their flow rates dynamically, ensuring that for every two parts of reactant A, one part of reactant B is added.

Include logic to monitor the flow rates of both reactants and adjust one flow rate relative to the other to maintain the 2:1 ratio. The program should also handle any disturbances or variations in flow, adjusting the control signals to correct for deviations from the target ratio. Discuss the importance of ratio control in maintaining the desired chemical composition and the impact of disturbances on the mixing process.


**C-A-R-E:**

🟥 C (Context) – The Background

In chemical processing and blending operations, achieving the correct mixing ratio between reactants is essential for maintaining product consistency, yield, and safety. A common requirement is to maintain a fixed ratio—such as 2:1—between two reactants. Variations in flow rate due to disturbances can lead to off-spec mixtures or unstable reactions, making ratio control a vital component of the control strategy.

🟩 A (Action) – What to Implement

Develop a self-contained IEC 61131-3 Structured Text program (not a function block) that:
	•	Monitors the actual flow rate of reactant A (Flow_A_PV) and reactant B (Flow_B_PV)
	•	Calculates the required setpoint for reactant B to maintain a 2:1 ratio (A:B)
	•	Updates the Flow_B_SP value dynamically based on changes in A’s flow rate
	•	Optionally includes tolerance checking or alarms for ratio deviations
	•	Ensures smooth response to flow variations and disturbances in the upstream process

⸻

🟨 R (Result) – What You Should Achieve

The program should:
	•	Maintain the specified 2:1 reactant ratio with real-time adjustment
	•	Prevent incorrect mixtures by recalculating flow targets during disturbances
	•	Enhance process quality and reliability, particularly in continuous mixing systems
	•	Be ready for integration with PID controllers or actuator logic to physically adjust the dosing equipment

VAR
    Flow_A_PV : REAL;               // Measured flow of reactant A
    Flow_B_PV : REAL;               // Measured flow of reactant B
    Flow_B_SP : REAL;               // Desired setpoint flow for reactant B

    Ratio_Setpoint : REAL := 2.0;   // A:B = 2:1
    Actual_Ratio : REAL;
    Error : REAL;
    Tolerance : REAL := 0.05;       // Acceptable margin for ratio deviation
END_VAR

// Calculate actual ratio if Flow_B_PV > 0
IF Flow_B_PV > 0.0 THEN
    Actual_Ratio := Flow_A_PV / Flow_B_PV;
ELSE
    Actual_Ratio := 0.0;
END_IF

// Determine desired flow for reactant B
Flow_B_SP := Flow_A_PV / Ratio_Setpoint;

// Optional error check
Error := Actual_Ratio - Ratio_Setpoint;
// If ABS(Error) > Tolerance, raise alarm or flag for corrective action
