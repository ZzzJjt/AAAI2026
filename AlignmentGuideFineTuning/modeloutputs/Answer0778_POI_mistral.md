### Intent:
The task is to develop an IEC 61131-3 Structured Text program for safely controlling the startup and shutdown sequences of a 3D pouch making machine, including temperature regulation of heating/cooling stations, feeder speed synchronization, tension control, and cutter coordination with safety interlocks.

### Prompt:
**Shutdown Steel Production:**

Develop a comprehensive list of steps for the controlled shutdown of a steel production facility. Include key stages such as reducing furnace temperature, controlling gas flow rates, and maintaining safe oxygen levels throughout the shutdown process.

Provide a detailed control narrative for steps 4 to 6 of the shutdown sequence, specifying concrete ranges and setpoints for variables such as temperature, gas flow, and oxygen levels.

Write a self-contained IEC 61131-3 Structured Text program based on this control narrative, ensuring proper sequencing and safety protocols.

Additionally, create a function in IEC 61131-3 to gradually reduce the fuel gas flow rate to the furnace burners over a period of 12 hours. This function should incorporate timing and safety checks to ensure smooth transitions.

Lastly, write an IEC 61131-3 function for adjusting the oxygen supply to the burners to maintain a precise fuel-to-air ratio of 1:2.5 during the shutdown. Ensure the function is adaptable to fluctuations in gas flow and temperature, and include safeguards for maintaining combustion efficiency.

**Step-by-Step Shutdown Sequence:**

1. Notify operators and initiate shutdown procedures
2. Reduce feeder speed to minimum
3. Stop production and isolate power sources
4. Initiate furnace cooldown by reducing fuel gas flow and increasing cooling water flow
5. Monitor and control temperature drop to 1200Â°C (2192Â°F)
6. Reduce cooling water flow and continue temperature drop to 1000Â°C (1832Â°F)
7. Reduce oxygen supply to maintain 1:2.5 fuel-to-air ratio
8. Monitor and control temperature drop to 800Â°C (1472Â°F)
9. Reduce oxygen supply to minimum
10. Monitor and control temperature drop to 600Â°C (1112Â°F)
11. Shut off fuel gas and oxygen supply
12. Ventilate furnace and cool to ambient temperature
