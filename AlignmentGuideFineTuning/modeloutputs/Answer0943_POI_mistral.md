### Intent:
The task is to develop an ISA-88-compliant batch control recipe for aspirin production, including a Structured Text implementation for the reaction stage with precise temperature, pressure, and timing controls, while ensuring proper transitions between process phases and maintaining 90Â°C during drying.  

**Intent Summary:**  
*Create an ISA-88 batch control system for aspirin manufacturing, featuring a Structured Text program to automate the reaction stage with parameterized heating, mixing, and drying processes.*

### Prompt:
**Batch Aspirin:**

Develop an ISA-88 batch control recipe for the production of aspirin (acetylsalicylic acid), outlining the process stages and the physical structure, which includes a reactor, crystallizer, centrifuge, and dryer. The process involves the following educts: acetic anhydride, salicylic acid, and sulfuric acid as a catalyst, with products being acetylsalicylic acid and acetic acid. The drying stage should occur at 90Â°C.

Write a self-contained program in IEC 61131-3 Structured Text for the sequential control of the reaction stage, incorporating typical parameter values for temperature, pressure, and timing. Ensure that the program logic follows the batch control principles of ISA-88, with clear transitions between operations like heating, mixing, and reaction completion. Additionally, include control parameters for initiating and managing the crystallization and drying phases, ensuring that temperature and time controls are accurate.
