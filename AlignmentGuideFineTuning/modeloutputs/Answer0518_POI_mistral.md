🟥 R (Role) – Your Role

You are a PLC programmer or control systems engineer developing statistical function blocks in IEC 61131-3 Structured Text to support real-time probabilistic event analysis in industrial systems.

⸻

🟩 I (Input) – What You’re Given

You need to implement a function block that calculates the Poisson distribution probability, given:
	•	Lambda : REAL — the expected number of events (mean rate, λ)
	•	K : INT — the number of actual events observed

The output should be:
	•	Probability : REAL — the probability that K events occur given a rate Lambda
	•	Based on the Poisson probability mass function:
P(k; \lambda) = \frac{e^{-\lambda} \cdot \lambda^k}{k!}

You must also consider:
	•	Overflow and precision loss with large values of λ or k
	•	Executing efficiently within a real-time PLC scan cycle
	•	Proper domain checks (e.g., Lambda > 0, K ≥ 0)

⸻

🟧 S (Steps) – What You Need to Do
	1.	Define a function block named PoissonProbability with the following structure:
 FUNCTION_BLOCK PoissonProbability
VAR_INPUT
    Lambda : REAL;
    K : INT;
END_VAR
VAR_OUTPUT
    Probability : REAL;
END_VAR
	2.	Add logic to calculate factorial for K:
 VAR
    i : INT;
    Factorial : REAL := 1.0;
END_VAR

FOR i := 1 TO K DO
    Factorial := Factorial * i;
END_FOR;
	3.	Compute the Poisson probability:
 IF (Lambda > 0) AND (K >= 0) THEN
    Probability := EXP(-Lambda) * POW(Lambda, K) / Factorial;
ELSE
    Probability := 0.0;
END_IF;
	4.	Add inline comments explaining:
	•	Each step of the Poisson formula
	•	Why factorial is manually computed (no built-in factorial in ST)
	•	How floating-point math affects precision
	•	Consideration of upper limits for K to prevent overflow

⸻

🟦 E (Expectation) – What Success Looks Like

You deliver a compact and accurate function block that:
	•	Computes Poisson probabilities reliably for typical values of Lambda and K
	•	Avoids crashing or incorrect output for edge cases (e.g. negative inputs)
	•	Executes quickly enough for inclusion in real-time event monitoring applications
	•	Can be reused in use cases such as:
	•	Predicting machine failure rates
	•	Sensor event tracking over time intervals
	•	Process bottleneck analysis

🟨 N (Notes) – What You Should Know

	•	The Poisson distribution is a discrete probability distribution that describes the probability of a given number of events occurring in a fixed interval of time or space, if these events occur with a known average rate and independently of the time since the last event.
	•	The Poisson distribution is often used in industrial applications to model event-driven processes, such as the number of machine failures, the number of sensor readings within a specific range, or the number of network packets transmitted in a given time frame.
	•	The Poisson distribution is memoryless, meaning that the probability of an event occurring in the next time interval does not depend on the number of events that have occurred in previous intervals.
	•	The Poisson distribution is a good approximation for the binomial distribution when the number of trials (n) is large and the probability of success (p) is small.
	•	The Poisson distribution can be used to calculate the probability of a specific number of events occurring in a given time interval, given the average rate of events.
	•	The Poisson distribution can be used to calculate the expected value (mean) and variance of the number of events in a given time interval.
	•	The Poisson distribution can be used to calculate the cumulative distribution function (CDF) to find the probability of observing a specific number of events or fewer in a given time interval.
	•	The Poisson distribution can be used to calculate the probability density function (PDF) to find the probability of observing a specific number of events in a given time interval.
	•	The Poisson distribution can be used to calculate the moment-generating function (MGF) to find the expected value and variance of the number of events in a given time interval.
	•	The Poisson distribution can be used to calculate the characteristic function (CF) to find the expected value and variance of the number of events in a given time interval.
	•	The Poisson distribution can be used to calculate the cumulant-generating function (CGF) to find the expected value and variance of the number of events in a given time interval.
