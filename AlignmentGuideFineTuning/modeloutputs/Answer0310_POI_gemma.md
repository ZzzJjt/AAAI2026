### Intent:
**Intent Summary:**  
Develop an IEC 61131-3 Structured Text program to dynamically maintain a 2:1 ratio between two reactant flows (A:B) by adjusting flow rates in real-time, ensuring consistent chemical mixing despite disturbances.  

*(Focus: Ratio control, real-time adjustment, disturbance handling, no function blocks.)*

### Prompt:
**Ratio Control Mixing:**

Develop a self-contained IEC 61131-3 Structured Text program (not a function block) to implement ratio control for mixing two reactants in a 2:1 ratio. The program should maintain the desired ratio between the two reactants by adjusting their flow rates dynamically, ensuring that for every two parts of reactant A, one part of reactant B is added.

Include logic to monitor the flow rates of both reactants and adjust one flow rate relative to the other to maintain the 2:1 ratio. The program should also handle any disturbances or variations in flow, adjusting the control signals to correct for deviations from the target ratio. Discuss the importance of ratio control in maintaining the desired chemical composition and the impact of disturbances on the mixing process.


**C-A-R-E:**

ðŸŸ¥ C (Context) â€“ The Background

In chemical processing and blending operations, achieving the correct mixing ratio between reactants is essential for maintaining product consistency, yield, and safety. A common requirement is to maintain a fixed ratioâ€”such as 2:1â€”between two reactants. Variations in flow rate due to disturbances can lead to off-spec mixtures or unstable reactions, making ratio control a vital component of the control strategy.

ðŸŸ© A (Action) â€“ What to Implement

Develop a self-contained IEC 61131-3 Structured Text program (not a function block) that:
	â€¢	Monitors the actual flow rate of reactant A (Flow_A_PV) and reactant B (Flow_B_PV)
	â€¢	Calculates the required setpoint for reactant B to maintain a 2:1 ratio (A:B)
	â€¢	Updates the Flow_B_SP value dynamically based on changes in Aâ€™s flow rate
	â€¢	Optionally includes tolerance checking or alarms for ratio deviations
	â€¢	Ensures smooth response to flow variations and disturbances in the upstream process

ðŸŸ¨ R (Result) â€“ What You Should Achieve

The program should:
	â€¢	Maintain the specified 2:1 reactant ratio with real-time adjustment
	â€¢	Prevent incorrect mixtures by recalculating flow targets during disturbances
	â€¢	Enhance process quality and reliability, particularly in continuous mixing systems
	â€¢	Be ready for integration with PID controllers or actuator logic to physically adjust the dosing equipment

**Discussion:**

The program monitors the actual flow rate of reactant A (Flow_A_PV) and reactant B (Flow_B_PV) and calculates the required setpoint for reactant B to maintain a 2:1 ratio (A:B). It updates the Flow_B_SP value dynamically based on changes in Aâ€™s flow rate.

The program also includes logic to handle disturbances or variations in flow, adjusting the control signals to correct for deviations from the target ratio. This ensures that the mixing process remains stable and consistent, even in the face of external factors that could affect the flow rates.

The program is self-contained and does not rely on any external function blocks or libraries. This makes it easy to integrate into existing control systems and ensures that it can be easily maintained and updated in the future.

The program is designed to be used in a variety of chemical processing and blending operations, where maintaining a consistent ratio between reactants is essential for product quality and safety. By dynamically adjusting the flow rates of the reactants, the program ensures that the desired ratio is maintained, even in the face of disturbances or variations in the upstream process.
