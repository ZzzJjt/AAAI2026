**Example Application:**

A chemical plant needs to optimize the blending of raw materials to meet product specifications while minimizing costs. The SimplexSolver function block can be used to determine the optimal quantities of each raw material to blend, given constraints on the final product's composition and the availability of raw materials. This optimization can be performed in real-time, allowing the plant to adjust its operations dynamically to respond to changing market conditions or raw material availability.

**Note:** The provided code snippet is a starting point for the function block, but it does not include the complete implementation of the Simplex algorithm. The actual implementation would require a more detailed algorithmic approach and error handling. The function block should be thoroughly tested and validated to ensure it meets the performance and accuracy requirements of the industrial application.
