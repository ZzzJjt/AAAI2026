### Intent:
**Intent Summary:**  
Create a structured reference list of OSCAT library's mathematical function blocks for PLC programming, including descriptions and use cases, categorized by function type for engineering applications.  

**Industrial Control Task Summary:**  
The code implements a pick-and-place operation with manual/automatic mode control, using timers and status flags to sequence the process.  

*(Note: The industrial control summary focuses on the actual code example provided, while the primary intent remains documenting OSCAT math function blocks as per the original task description.)*

### Prompt:
**List Mathematical Function Blocks:**
Compile a detailed list of all mathematical function blocks available in the OSCAT library for PLC programming, including a brief description of their functionality and typical use cases.

**T-A-G:**

ðŸŸ¥ T (Task) â€“ What You Need to Do

ðŸŸ© A (Action) â€“ How You Should Do It

To complete this task:
	1.	Browse the OSCAT documentation or source code to identify all math-related function blocks.
	2.	For each function block, include:
	â€¢	Function block name (e.g., SIN, MEAN_ARRAY)
	â€¢	A brief functional description
	â€¢	Typical use case (e.g., waveform generation, process data smoothing, quality control)
	3.	Categorize the blocks for readability, such as:
	â€¢	Trigonometric Functions
	â€¢	Algebraic Operations
	â€¢	Statistical Calculations
	â€¢	Exponential/Logarithmic Functions
	â€¢	Array and Data Processing
	4.	Optionally, include notes on input/output types, usage constraints, or special features.
