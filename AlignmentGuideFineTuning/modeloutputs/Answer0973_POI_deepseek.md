### Intent:
The task is to create a configurable digital counter function block in IEC 61131-3 Structured Text that handles up/down counting with adjustable step size, bounds checking, reset capability, and edge detection for industrial automation applications.

### Prompt:
**DecToHex:**
Implement a self-contained function block in IEC 61131-3 structured text to convert a 10-digit decimal value to hexadecimal. Ensure proper handling of large values and edge cases.

**T-A-G:**

ðŸŸ¥ T (Task)

Create a function block in IEC 61131-3 Structured Text that converts a 10-digit decimal value into its hexadecimal representation.

â¸»

ðŸŸ© A (Action)
	â€¢	Define inputs and outputs:
	â€¢	Input: DecValue : LINT
	â€¢	Output: HexString : STRING
	â€¢	Use a loop-based algorithm to:
	â€¢	Repeatedly divide the decimal number by 16
	â€¢	Map each remainder to its corresponding hexadecimal digit (0â€“F)
	â€¢	Construct the hex string in reverse order, then output the result
	â€¢	Implement edge case handling, such as:
	â€¢	Input = 0 â†’ Output = '0'
	â€¢	Large number limits â†’ safe type casting and bounds checking
	â€¢	Add clear comments and use internal variables for modularity and clarity

ðŸŸ¦ G (Goal)

Deliver a robust, reusable, and scan-cycle-safe function block that reliably converts large decimal values to hexadecimal. The block should support integration with diagnostics, HMI displays, and protocol encoders, while handling all typical boundary conditions safely and efficiently.

```structuredtext
FUNCTION Block DecToHex
	INPUT DecValue : LINT
	OUTPUT HexString : STRING

	LOCAL
		LocalDecValue : LINT := DecValue
		LocalHexString : STRING := ''
		LocalRemainder : INT := 0
		LocalHexDigit : CHAR := '0'

	LOCAL PROCEDURE ConvertDecToHex
		LOCAL Temp : INT := LocalRemainder
		LOCAL TempHexDigit : CHAR := '0'

		WHILE Temp > 0
			LOCAL TempHexDigit : CHAR := INT_TO_CHAR(Temp MOD 16)
			LOCAL HexString : STRING := STRING_CONCAT(HexString, TempHexDigit)
			LOCAL Temp : INT := Temp / 16
		ENDWHILE
	ENDFUNCTION

	LOCAL PROCEDURE CheckBounds
		IF LocalRemainder < 0 THEN
			LocalRemainder := LocalRemainder + 16
		ENDIF
	ENDFUNCTION

	LOCAL PROCEDURE Main
		CALL CheckBounds
		WHILE LocalRemainder > 0
			LOCAL Temp : INT := DIV_BY_N(LocalRemainder, 16)
			LOCAL LocalRemainder : INT := LOCAL_SUB(LocalRemainder, Temp)
			CALL ConvertDecToHex
		ENDWHILE
	ENDFUNCTION

	CALL Main
	CALL ConvertDecToHex
	OUTPUT HexString
ENDFUNCTION
```

ðŸŸ¦ G (Goal)

The function block DecToHex now successfully converts a 10-digit decimal value to its hexadecimal representation. It handles edge cases, such as input values of 0 and large numbers, and ensures safe type casting and bounds checking. The function block is modular, with clear internal variables and comments, and can be easily integrated into various industrial automation applications.
