### Intent:
**Intent Summary:**  
Create a reusable IEC 61131-3 structured text function block for a PID controller with configurable gains, error handling, anti-windup, and output clamping to enable precise real-time closed-loop control in PLC systems.  

*(Focus: Robust industrial PID logic with tuning, safety, and reusability.)*

### Prompt:
**PID Controller:**
Implement a self-contained function block in IEC 61131-3 structured text to create a PID controller. Include configurable parameters for proportional, integral, and derivative gains, with error handling and tuning capability.

**T-A-G:**

ðŸŸ¥ T (Task)

Implement a self-contained PID controller as a function block in IEC 61131-3 Structured Text for real-time control in PLC-based automation systems.

ðŸŸ© A (Action)
	â€¢	Define the following inputs:
	â€¢	Setpoint, ProcessVariable (for error calculation)
	â€¢	Kp, Ki, Kd (gain tuning parameters)
	â€¢	MinOutput, MaxOutput (output clamping)
	â€¢	Enable, Reset (runtime control flags)
	â€¢	Create the PID logic:
	â€¢	Compute the control error: Error := Setpoint - ProcessVariable
	â€¢	Accumulate the integral term using Ki and DeltaT, with anti-windup logic
	â€¢	Calculate the derivative term from the rate of change of the process variable
	â€¢	Compute the control output and apply output limits
	â€¢	Reset internal states if Reset = TRUE
	â€¢	Use internal memory to track previous values and ensure smooth scan-cycle execution
	â€¢	Include comments for each computation block to improve readability and maintenance

ðŸŸ¦ G (Goal)

Deliver a robust, tunable, and reusable PID controller function block that performs well in real-time industrial control applications. The block should ensure safe, stable, and accurate output control with built-in safeguards like anti-windup and clamping, making it suitable for integration into any PLC-based closed-loop control system.
