The C++ code should be modular, well-documented, and easily extensible for future enhancements.

**C++ Code for Model Predictive Control of HVAC System:**

To implement the MPC algorithm for the HVAC system, follow these steps:

1. **Model the HVAC System Dynamics:**
   - Define the system's state variables, such as indoor temperature, humidity, and energy usage.
   - Model the thermal response of the system, including heat transfer between indoor and outdoor environments.
   - Incorporate humidity control mechanisms, such as dehumidifiers or humidifiers.
   - Consider energy usage behavior, including the efficiency of heating, cooling, and ventilation components.

2. **Implement the MPC Algorithm:**
   - Create a function to predict future system states based on the current state and control inputs.
   - Define the objective function to minimize, such as energy consumption or deviation from setpoints.
   - Formulate the MPC problem as a constrained optimization problem, considering constraints on energy usage, external weather conditions, and occupancy profiles.
   - Use a solver library (e.g., Gurobi, CPLEX) to solve the optimization problem and obtain optimal control inputs.

3. **Incorporate Constraints:**
   - Define constraints on energy usage, such as maximum power consumption or daily energy limits.
   - Consider external weather conditions, including temperature and humidity, as constraints.
   - Implement occupancy profiles as constraints, ensuring the system meets occupant comfort requirements.

4. **Simulate Scenarios:**
   - Create a simulation environment to test the MPC system under various conditions.
   - Vary external temperatures, occupancy levels, and energy efficiency goals to evaluate system performance.
   - Compare the MPC system's performance against traditional control approaches, such as PID or on-off control.

5. **Document and Test:**
   - Document the code thoroughly, including explanations of the MPC algorithm, system modeling, and constraints.
   - Test the code under different scenarios to ensure it functions correctly and meets performance expectations.
   - Optimize the code for efficiency and maintainability, considering future enhancements and scalability.

**Expected Outcome:**

The completed C++ code should demonstrate improved energy efficiency, faster response to environmental changes, and enhanced occupant comfort compared to traditional control approaches. The MPC-based HVAC system should be able to adapt to dynamic environmental conditions, respect operational constraints, and optimize performance in real-time scenarios.
