### Intent:
**Intent Summary:**  
Develop a Python-based fuzzy logic control system to optimize chemical reactor performance by adaptively managing temperature, pressure, and reaction rate under nonlinear/uncertain conditions, demonstrating robustness against disturbances through real-time simulation.  

*(Focus: Fuzzy logic, reactor optimization, uncertainty handling, Python simulation)*

### Prompt:
**Fuzzy Logic Control for Chemical Reactor Optimization Using Python:**

Develop Python code to implement a fuzzy logic control system for optimizing the operation of a chemical reactor. The control system should manage key reactor variables such as temperature, pressure, and reaction rate, considering the nonlinear and uncertain nature of the reactorâ€™s dynamics. Fuzzy logic should be applied to handle imprecise inputs and adjust control actions in real-time to maintain optimal reactor performance under varying operating conditions.

Implement Python code to simulate the chemical reactorâ€™s dynamics, demonstrating how fuzzy logic control can provide robust and adaptive responses to system uncertainties and process variations.

**C-A-R-E:**

ðŸŸ¥ Cï¼ˆContextï¼‰

Chemical reactors often operate under nonlinear and uncertain conditions, where precise modeling is difficult. Traditional control systems may fail to maintain optimal performance when inputs are imprecise or when the process environment changes dynamically.

ðŸŸ© Aï¼ˆActionï¼‰

Develop Python code to implement a fuzzy logic control system that can effectively regulate key reactor variables such as temperature, pressure, and reaction rate. Design fuzzy rules and membership functions to manage uncertainty and adapt control actions in real time.

ðŸŸ¨ Rï¼ˆResultï¼‰

The fuzzy logic controller should demonstrate improved robustness, flexibility, and adaptability compared to conventional controllers, ensuring stable and optimal reactor operation under a wide range of process conditions.

ðŸŸ¦ Eï¼ˆExampleï¼‰

Simulate a scenario where the reactor experiences sudden pressure fluctuations or uncertain temperature readings. Use the fuzzy logic system to show how it adjusts control actions smoothly and maintains performance, while a traditional controller might overreact or become unstable.
