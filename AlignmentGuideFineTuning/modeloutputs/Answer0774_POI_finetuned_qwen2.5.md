### Intent:
The task is to develop an ISA-88-compliant batch control program in IEC 61131-3 Structured Text for producing 100 kg of cocoa milk, including ingredient dosing, mixing at 200 RPM, heating to 70Â°C, and phase-based process control with fault handling.

### Prompt:
**Batch Cocoa Milk:**

Create an ISA-88 batch control recipe for producing 100 kg of cocoa milk, detailing the required ingredients, including milk, water, liquid sugar, and cocoa. The equipment should consist of a mixing and blending vessel capable of stirring and heating. Specify appropriate amounts for each ingredient, as well as optimal mixing temperatures and heating times.

Write a self-contained program in IEC 61131-3 Structured Text for the sequential control of the mixing process, incorporating typical parameter values such as stirring speed, temperature control, and time duration. Ensure the program follows ISA-88 principles, with clear logic for controlling the heating and blending phases. Discuss the challenges in scaling and optimizing the control process for industrial production.
