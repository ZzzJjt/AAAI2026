**Introduction:**

Welcome to the world of IEC 61499, a modern programming language for distributed control systems. If you're already familiar with IEC 61131-3, you'll find that IEC 61499 offers a fresh approach to designing and implementing control applications. In this guide, we'll explore the key concepts of IEC 61499, compare it with IEC 61131-3, and provide you with valuable resources to help you get started.

**Key Concepts of IEC 61499:**

1. Event-driven architecture: IEC 61499 is designed around events, allowing for more flexible and responsive control systems.
2. Function blocks with separated event/data interfaces: Function blocks in IEC 61499 have distinct interfaces for events and data, making them easier to reuse and integrate.
3. Distributed capabilities: IEC 61499 supports distributed control systems by allowing function blocks to be executed on different devices across a network.

**Comparing IEC 61499 with IEC 61131-3:**

1. Execution models: IEC 61499 uses an event-driven execution model, while IEC 61131-3 relies on a scan-based approach.
2. Architecture: IEC 61499 is designed for distributed control systems, while IEC 61131-3 is more suited for centralized systems.
3. Reusability and portability: IEC 61499's platform independence allows for greater reusability and portability of function blocks across different hardware and software platforms.
