### Intent:
**Intent Summary:**  
Develop a cascaded PID control system in Structured Text that regulates a heat exchanger's outlet temperature by first adjusting the flow setpoint (outer loop) and then controlling the heating medium's flow rate (inner loop), with safety constraints and input validation.

### Prompt:
**PID Flow Control Water Treatment:**

Develop a self-contained IEC 61131-3 Structured Text program to implement PID feedback control for chemical dosing in a water treatment process. The program should regulate the dosing rate of chlorine at 3 ppm, adjusting based on real-time flow measurements with a sampling rate of 100 ms.

The control logic should include PID parameters (proportional, integral, and derivative gains) that are tuned for maintaining the desired dosing concentration. Ensure the program accounts for any deviations from the setpoint and adjusts the chemical dosing accordingly, while including safety limits to prevent overdosing or underdosing. Discuss the importance of precise flow control in water treatment, with a focus on maintaining safe and effective chemical levels.

ðŸŸ¥ R (Role) â€“ Your Role

You are a PLC automation engineer tasked with developing a Structured Text program based on the IEC 61131-3 standard to implement PID-based chlorine dosing control in a water treatment plant. Your goal is to ensure real-time, precise chemical regulation in response to flow variations.

ðŸŸ© T (Task) â€“ What You Need to Do

Create a self-contained Structured Text program (not a function block) that:
	1.	Uses PID feedback control to maintain a chlorine concentration setpoint of 3 ppm.
	2.	Samples the process every 100 milliseconds (0.1 seconds).
	3.	Receives real-time inputs for:
	â€¢	Chlorine concentration (Dosing_PV)
	â€¢	Water flow rate (FlowRate, optional for future integration)
	4.	Calculates PID output (Dosing_Output) using tuned values for:
	â€¢	Kp := 2.0, Ki := 0.5, Kd := 0.1
	5.	Implements clamping logic to keep dosing within safe limits (0.0 to 10.0 ppm).

ðŸŸ§ F (Format) â€“ Expected Output

You should provide a clean, readable Structured Text code block like this:

VAR
    // Inputs
    FlowRate : REAL;                   // Flow rate (optional for future use)
    Dosing_PV : REAL;                  // Measured chlorine concentration
    Dosing_SP : REAL := 3.0;           // Target setpoint (ppm)

    // PID tuning parameters
    Kp : REAL := 2.0;
    Ki : REAL := 0.5;
    Kd : REAL := 0.1;

    // Internal PID variables
    Error : REAL;
    Prev_Error : REAL := 0.0;
    Integral : REAL := 0.0;
    Derivative : REAL;
    Dosing_Output : REAL;

    // Safety limits
    Max_Dose : REAL := 10.0;
    Min_Dose : REAL := 0.0;
END_VAR

// PID algorithm (100 ms cycle)
Error := Dosing_SP - Dosing_PV;
Integral := Integral + Error * 0.1;            // Integral over 100 ms
Derivative := (Error - Prev_Error) / 0.1;      // Derivative over 100 ms

Dosing_Output := (Kp * Error) + (Ki * Integral) + (Kd * Derivative);

// Clamp output to safe range
IF Dosing_Output > Max_Dose THEN
    Dosing_Output := Max_Dose;
ELSIF Dosing_Output < Min_Dose THEN
    Dosing_Output := Min_Dose;
END_IF

Prev_Error := Error;

This format ensures:
	â€¢	Safe and accurate chemical dosing under changing flow conditions
	â€¢	Efficient response to process variations
	â€¢	Code that is production-ready, readable, and suitable for real-time PLC systems

âœ… Example Use Case

In a water treatment plant, the PLC runs this program every 100 ms. If the measured chlorine concentration drops to 2.5 ppm, the PID controller calculates a dosing correction of 0.5 ppm. The output is clamped to 10.0 ppm to prevent overdosing, ensuring the system maintains safe and effective chemical levels.
