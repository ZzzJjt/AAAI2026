### Intent:
**Intent Summary:**  
Develop an IEC 61131-3 Structured Text program for feedforward control in a chemical mixing process, dynamically adjusting Reactant A's flow rate based on Reactant B's flow, concentration, and temperature to maintain a desired ratio, with safety checks and real-time compensation.  

*(Key focus: Predictive flow adjustment, disturbance compensation, and safety logic for industrial PLC deployment.)*

### Prompt:
**Feedforward Control Mixing:**

Develop a self-contained IEC 61131-3 Structured Text program (not a function block) to implement feedforward control for mixing two reactants in a chemical process. The program should predict the necessary adjustments to the flow rates of each reactant based on known disturbances or input changes, ensuring optimal mixing conditions.

Include logic that calculates the required feedforward adjustments based on process variables such as flow rates, concentration, and temperature, and ensure the control system can respond quickly to input changes without relying solely on feedback. Discuss the advantages of using feedforward control in mixing processes, particularly in terms of improving response time and reducing process variability compared to traditional feedback control.

ðŸŸ¥ T (Task) â€“ What You Need to Do

Write a self-contained IEC 61131-3 Structured Text program (not a function block) to implement feedforward control for mixing two reactants in a chemical process. The system must calculate and adjust the flow rate of Reactant A in real time based on changes in Reactant Bâ€™s flow or properties.

ðŸŸ© A (Action) â€“ How to Do It
	1.	Read sensor inputs for:
	â€¢	Flow_B â€“ the measured flow rate of Reactant B
	â€¢	Optional: Concentration_B, Temperature_B â€“ to enable dynamic compensation
	2.	Use feedforward logic to calculate the required flow rate of Reactant A using:
	â€¢	Flow_A_Setpoint := Desired_Ratio * Flow_B * Compensation_Factor
	3.	Apply compensation if concentration or temperature influences flow behavior, enabling more precise ratio control.
	4.	Send the calculated setpoint to the actuator controlling Reactant Aâ€™s pump or valve.

ðŸŸ¦ G (Goal) â€“ What You Want to Achieve

The program should:
	â€¢	Predict and pre-adjust Reactant Aâ€™s flow in real time to match the desired mix ratio
	â€¢	Enable the mixing process to be more responsive and less dependent on slow feedback loops
	â€¢	Maintain stable product quality even under input disturbances
