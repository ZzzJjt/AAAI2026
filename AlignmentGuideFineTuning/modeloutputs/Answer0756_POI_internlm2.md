### Intent:
**Intent Summary:**  
Develop a feedforward control program in Structured Text that adjusts conveyor speed based on predicted material load, with input validation and output clamping to maintain safe operational limits.

### Prompt:
**PID Level Control Distillation Column:**

Develop a self-contained IEC 61131-3 Structured Text program to implement PID feedback control for maintaining the liquid level in a distillation column. The control system should adjust the opening of an inlet valve that feeds liquid into the column based on the level setpoint.

The program should incorporate the PID parameters (proportional, integral, and derivative gains) and handle scenarios where the liquid level deviates from the setpoint. Ensure that the logic includes limits on the inlet valve position to prevent overfeeding or underfeeding the column. Discuss the importance of level control in maintaining the efficiency and stability of the distillation process, focusing on response time and control precision under varying operating conditions.

**R-T-F:**

ðŸŸ¥ R (Role) â€“ Your Role

You are a PLC programmer responsible for developing a PID-based control program using IEC 61131-3 Structured Text. Your goal is to maintain the liquid level in a distillation column by controlling the inlet valve position.

â¸»

ðŸŸ© T (Task) â€“ What You Need to Do

Create a self-contained Structured Text program (not a function block) that:
	1.	Reads the current liquid level (Level_PV) and compares it to a setpoint (Level_SP).
	2.	Implements PID control logic using proportional, integral, and derivative gains:
	â€¢	Kp := 1.5, Ki := 0.4, Kd := 0.2
	3.	Calculates a valve position output (Valve_Position) that adjusts the flow of liquid into the column to maintain the desired level.
	4.	Clamps the output between Valve_Min := 0.0 and Valve_Max := 100.0 to prevent overfeeding or underfeeding.
	5.	Runs the PID calculation at a sampling rate of 100 ms, with internal state tracking (Integral, Prev_Error, Derivative).

ðŸŸ¦ F (Format) â€“ Expected Output

Provide a complete Structured Text code block like this:

VAR
    Level_PV : REAL;                    // Measured level (%)
    Level_SP : REAL := 60.0;            // Setpoint (%)

    // PID tuning
    Kp : REAL := 1.5;
    Ki : REAL := 0.4;
    Kd : REAL := 0.2;

    // PID internals
    Error : REAL;
    Prev_Error : REAL := 0.0;
    Integral : REAL := 0.0;
    Derivative : REAL;
    Valve_Position : REAL;

    // Valve output limits
    Valve_Min : REAL := 0.0;
    Valve_Max : REAL := 100.0;
END_VAR

// PID logic (100 ms cycle)
Error := Level_SP - Level_PV;
Integral := Integral + Error * 0.1;
Derivative := (Error - Prev_Error) / 0.1;

Valve_Position := (Kp * Error) + (Ki * Integral) + (Kd * Derivative);

// Clamp the output
IF Valve_Position > Valve_Max THEN
    Valve_Position := Valve_Max;
ELSIF Valve_Position < Valve_Min THEN
    Valve_Position := Valve_Min;
END_IF

Prev_Error := Error;
