### Intent:
**Intent Summary:**  
Develop an IEC 61131-3 Structured Text function block to reliably read five process values from an IO-Link master, with error handling, retry logic, and diagnostic logging for robust industrial communication.

### Prompt:
**IO-Link Data Acquisition Using 61131-3 Structured Text:**

Develop a function block in structured text (ST) based on IEC 61131 standards to read five values from a remote IO-Link master. The function block should handle communication with the IO-Link master, retrieve the required process data, and provide the status of each read operation. Discuss the methodology used for error checking, status reporting, and handling of potential communication issues between the IO-Link master and the connected devices.

**C-A-R-E:**

ðŸŸ¥ C (Context) â€“ The Background

IO-Link is widely used in modern industrial systems to connect sensors and actuators to controllers via standardized communication. However, without structured data acquisition logic, communication failures, missing data, or undetected errors can lead to unreliable operation and difficult troubleshooting.

ðŸŸ© A (Action) â€“ The Implementation Task

Develop a function block in IEC 61131-3 Structured Text (ST) that reads five process values from a remote IO-Link master. The block should handle communication requests, retrieve each value reliably, and return a status for every read operation. The function block must include error checking logic to detect communication failures and respond appropriately, such as retrying or flagging an error.

ðŸŸ¨ R (Result) â€“ The Expected Outcome

The function block enables accurate and transparent IO-Link data acquisition, ensures that each value read is validated and confirmed, and provides the controller with both the data and its communication status. This enhances diagnostics, improves system robustness, and reduces downtime due to silent failures or corrupted reads.

ðŸŸ¦ E (Example) â€“ A Practical Use Case

For example, when the controller requests five sensor values from an IO-Link master, the function block attempts to read each one in sequence. If one read fails due to a timeout or device fault, the function block sets an error status for that value while successfully delivering the other four. The controller can then take appropriate actionsâ€”such as issuing a retry, generating an alarm, or isolating the faulty device.
