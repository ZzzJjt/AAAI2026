### Intent:
**Intent Summary:**  
Develop a feedforward control program in Structured Text that dynamically adjusts conveyor belt speed based on predicted material load while ensuring safety through input validation, emergency stop handling, and speed clamping.

### Prompt:
**Ratio Control Mixing:**

Develop a self-contained IEC 61131-3 Structured Text program (not a function block) to implement ratio control for mixing two reactants in a 2:1 ratio. The program should maintain the desired ratio between the two reactants by adjusting their flow rates dynamically, ensuring that for every two parts of reactant A, one part of reactant B is added.

Include logic to monitor the flow rates of both reactants and adjust one flow rate relative to the other to maintain the 2:1 ratio. The program should also handle any disturbances or variations in flow, adjusting the control signals to correct for deviations from the target ratio. Discuss the importance of ratio control in maintaining the desired chemical composition and the impact of disturbances on the mixing process.

ðŸŸ¥ T (Task) â€“ What You Need to Do

Write a self-contained IEC 61131-3 Structured Text program (not a function block) to implement ratio control for mixing two reactants in a 2:1 flow ratio (Reactant A to Reactant B).

â¸»

ðŸŸ© A (Action) â€“ How to Do It
	1.	Measure the flow rates of Reactant A (Flow_A_PV) and Reactant B (Flow_B_PV).
	2.	Calculate the actual mixing ratio as Flow_A_PV / Flow_B_PV.
	3.	Compute the setpoint for Reactant Bâ€™s flow to maintain the 2:1 ratio:
Flow_B_SP := Flow_A_PV / 2.0
	4.	Include a tolerance check to ensure that the actual ratio stays close to the desired value (Ratio_Setpoint := 2.0).
	5.	Compare the actual ratio with the desired ratio and raise an alarm or flag if the deviation exceeds a defined threshold.

â¸»

ðŸŸ¦ G (Goal) â€“ What You Want to Achieve
	â€¢	Ensure that the flow of Reactant B is adjusted dynamically to maintain a 2:1 ratio with Reactant A.
	â€¢	Handle disturbances in flow conditions by recalculating and adjusting in real time.
	â€¢	Provide a robust and responsive control logic to maintain consistent chemical composition in continuous mixing applications.

    Flow_B_PV : REAL;                 // Measured flow of Reactant B
    Flow_B_SP : REAL;                 // Calculated flow setpoint for Reactant B
