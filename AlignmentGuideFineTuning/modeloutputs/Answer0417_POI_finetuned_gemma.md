### Intent:
**Intent Summary:**  
Develop a C++ model predictive control (MPC) system for a wind farm with energy storage to optimize turbine output and battery charge/discharge, balancing power generation with load demand while respecting operational constraints.

### Prompt:
**Model Predictive Control for Optimizing Robot Movement Using Python:**

Develop Python code to implement a model predictive control (MPC) algorithm for optimizing the movement of a robot. The control system should consider dynamic constraints, path planning, and obstacle avoidance while ensuring smooth, efficient, and adaptive movement in a dynamic environment.

**R-I-S-E:**

🟥 R（Role）

Act as a robotics engineer specializing in motion planning and predictive control using Python.

🟩 I（Input）

You are tasked with developing a motion control system for a mobile robot navigating in a dynamic environment. The robot must move efficiently while avoiding obstacles and adhering to dynamic constraints such as speed limits, turning radius, and changing surroundings.

🟧 S（Steps）
	1.	Model the robot’s motion dynamics in Python, including constraints on acceleration, velocity, and orientation.
	2.	Implement a model predictive control (MPC) algorithm that plans the robot’s trajectory over a prediction horizon.
	3.	Integrate obstacle detection and avoidance mechanisms within the MPC framework.
	4.	Simulate various dynamic scenarios (e.g., moving obstacles, changing goal points) to test the robot’s adaptability and efficiency.

🟦 E（Expectation）

The robot should be able to navigate smoothly and efficiently, adapt to environmental changes in real time, and avoid obstacles—demonstrating the advantages of MPC over traditional control approaches in dynamic motion planning tasks.
