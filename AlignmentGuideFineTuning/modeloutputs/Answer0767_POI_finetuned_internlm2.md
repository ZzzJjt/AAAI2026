### Intent:
**Intent Summary:**  
Create a structured technical guide explaining object-oriented programming (OOP) in IEC 61131-3 (V3.0) for industrial automation, covering classes, inheritance, and polymorphism with practical examples, trade-offs, and best practices.  

**Industrial Control Task:**  
The provided code implements a state-machine-driven polyethylene batch control process, handling raw material preparation, reaction, cooling, and discharge phases with safety checks, input validation, and modular logic.  

*(Focus: OOP explanation for automation, bridging to the batch control example.)*

### Prompt:
**Object-oriented 61131-3:**
Discuss the concept of classes and methods introduced in IEC 61131-3 Version 3.0, including a detailed explanation of their limitations, advantages, and disadvantages in the context of industrial automation. Provide a relevant example to illustrate these concepts in practice.

Explain how inheritance is implemented in IEC 61131-3, building on the previous example to show how derived classes can extend base functionality. Additionally, refine the example further to demonstrate polymorphism within this framework, discussing its practical applications and constraints.

**R-T-F:**
