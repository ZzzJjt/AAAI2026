ðŸŸ¥ C (Context) â€“ The Background

In industrial automation, real-time signal analysisâ€”such as vibration, pressure, or electrical waveformsâ€”is essential for condition monitoring, diagnostics, and predictive maintenance. The Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) is a powerful algorithm used to convert time-domain data into the frequency domain. However, implementing FFT on a PLC is challenging due to limited computational power, memory constraints, and strict scan-time requirements typical of IEC 61131-3 environments.

ðŸŸ© A (Action) â€“ The Implementation Task

Design a self-contained function block in IEC 61131-3 Structured Text, named FFT_Block, that:
	â€¢	Accepts a REAL input array (e.g., InputSignal: ARRAY[1..N] OF REAL, where N is a power of two)
	â€¢	Computes the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) using an efficient algorithm such as radix-2 Cooley-Tukey
	â€¢	Returns FFT results as:
	â€¢	Amplitude spectrum (e.g., Amplitude[1..N/2]) or
	â€¢	Complex components if imaginary parts are required
	â€¢	Includes detailed inline comments explaining:
	â€¢	The FFT stages (bit-reversal, twiddle factors, butterfly operations)
	â€¢	Any normalization or scaling applied
	â€¢	Uses preallocated arrays and bounded loops to ensure performance within PLC cycle time
	â€¢	Optionally includes parameters for windowing or sample rate input

ðŸŸ¨ R (Result) â€“ The Expected Outcome

The resulting function block enables the PLC to perform basic frequency analysis directly, making it suitable for tasks such as:
	â€¢	Detecting vibration anomalies in motors
	â€¢	Analyzing pump cavitation frequencies
	â€¢	Monitoring power harmonics
	â€¢	Triggering alarms based on dominant frequency bands

It also ensures that the FFT runs reliably within PLC memory and timing limits, avoiding watchdog errors or overflow.

ðŸŸ¦ E (Example) â€“ A Practical Use Case

Suppose a 64-point sensor signal is collected from a vibration probe on a motor. This array is passed into FFT_Block. The block performs bit-reversal reordering, executes butterfly operations in-place, and returns the amplitude of the first 32 frequency bins. The result identifies a dominant frequency spike at 25 Hz, triggering a warning if it exceeds a defined threshold.
Example comment in code:
// Step 1: Reorder input using bit-reversal
// Step 2: Calculate twiddle factors and perform butterfly computation
// Step 3: Output magnitude spectrum for N/2 bins

While the focus on self-contained FFT implementation in IEC 61131-3 Structured Text is valuable, it is important to consider the trade-offs between efficiency and flexibility.
