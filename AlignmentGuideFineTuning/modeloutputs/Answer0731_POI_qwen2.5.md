**Explanation:**

Eigenvalues are crucial in industrial control systems for several reasons:
- **System Modeling:** They help in understanding the stability and behavior of dynamic systems.
- **Vibration Detection:** Eigenvalues can indicate the natural frequencies of a system, which is vital for detecting and mitigating vibrations.
- **Control Tuning:** They assist in designing controllers that can stabilize systems and improve performance.

Implementing such a function block in a PLC requires careful consideration of numerical stability and computational efficiency due to the limited processing power and memory of PLCs. The algorithm should be optimized to run within real-time constraints and include safeguards against non-convergence or timeout scenarios.
