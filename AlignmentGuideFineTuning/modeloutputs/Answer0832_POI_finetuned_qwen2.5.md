### Intent:
**Intent Summary:**  
Develop an IEC 61131-3 Structured Text function block to monitor and log real-time communication status (OPC UA, Modbus, Profinet) with alarm triggering and audit trail entries for failures, ensuring fault diagnostics and system reliability.  

**For Code Generation:**  
*"Create a structured text function block to monitor OPC UA/Modbus/Profinet connections, trigger alarms on failures, and log detailed error entries for troubleshooting."*

### Prompt:
**Communication Monitoring for OPC UA, Modbus, and Profinet Using IEC 61131-3 Structured Text:**

Develop a function block in structured text (ST) as per IEC 61131-3 standards to monitor communication connections to an OPC UA server, Modbus server, and Profinet in a machine system. The function block should continuously check the connection status of each protocol, and if any connection fails, an alarm should be triggered. Additionally, when a connection is lost, an entry must be created in the audit trail, detailing the reason for the server being down along with the corresponding error code. Discuss the implementation logic for monitoring multiple protocols, error detection, and how to effectively manage and log communication failures for real-time monitoring and troubleshooting.

**T-A-G:**

ðŸŸ¥ T (Task) â€“ What You Need to Do

Create an IEC 61131-3 Structured Text (ST) function block to monitor communication status for OPC UA, Modbus, and Profinet protocols within a machine control system.

ðŸŸ© A (Action) â€“ How to Do It

Develop logic that continuously checks the connection status of each protocol. If any connection fails, the function block should raise an alarm and generate an audit trail entry containing the protocol name, reason for the failure, and an associated error code. The block should handle each protocol independently and include mechanisms for error detection, alarm handling, and memory-safe logging.

ðŸŸ¦ G (Goal) â€“ What You Aim to Achieve

Ensure robust, real-time communication monitoring and fault diagnostics for all three protocols, enabling operators and maintenance teams to quickly identify, respond to, and trace communication failuresâ€”thus improving system uptime and traceability.

**R-I-S-E:**

ðŸŸ¥ R (Role) â€“ Your Role

You are a PLC programmer or automation engineer responsible for implementing communication monitoring and fault handling in a machine control system using IEC 61131-3 Structured Text.

ðŸŸ© I (Input) â€“ What Youâ€™re Given

You are tasked with monitoring three protocolsâ€”OPC UA, Modbus, and Profinetâ€”for connection status. The system must detect failures, trigger alarms, and log detailed entries for troubleshooting.

ðŸŸ¦ S (Steps) â€“ How to Proceed

	1.	Define a function block in IEC 61131-3 Structured Text to manage communication monitoring for all three protocols.
	2.	Implement logic to continuously check the connection status of each protocol using appropriate function blocks or methods.
	3.	When a connection fails, trigger an alarm and create an audit trail entry with:
	â€¢	Protocol name
	â€¢	Reason for the server being down
	â€¢	Associated error code
	4.	Ensure that the monitoring logic is modular and error-safe, with clear handling of protocol-specific error conditions.
	5.	Perform thorough testing to validate that the function block accurately monitors communication status and effectively logs failures.

ðŸŸ© E (Example) â€“ How It Works

	â€¢	For OPC UA, use the function block to check the connection status and trigger an alarm if the server is not available.
	â€¢	For Modbus, monitor the connection using a Modbus function block and log any communication errors.
	â€¢	For Profinet, check the network status using a Profinet function block and create an entry in the audit trail if the connection is lost.

	â€¢	Implement a CASE statement to handle different error conditions for each protocol, ensuring that the audit trail entry includes the relevant protocol-specific information.

	â€¢	For example, when OPC UA fails, the audit trail entry might look like:
	â€¢	"OPC UA server down: Connection timed out (Error Code: 10060)"

	â€¢	When Modbus fails, the entry could be:
	â€¢	"Modbus server down: Slave device not responding (Error Code: 1001)"

	â€¢	For Profinet, the entry would be:
	â€¢	"Profinet network down: Ethernet communication error (Error Code: 1002)"

	â€¢	Ensure that the function block is modular and reusable, with clear comments explaining
