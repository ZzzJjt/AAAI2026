ðŸŸ¥ C (Context) â€“ The Background

In industrial automation and process monitoring, itâ€™s often important to predict the likelihood of discrete events occurring over a period of timeâ€”such as sensor triggers, part arrivals, or faults. The Poisson distribution is widely used in such event-driven systems to estimate the probability of a certain number of events happening within a fixed interval. However, most IEC 61131-3 Structured Text environments do not provide built-in statistical functions, making it necessary to implement this computation manually and carefully handle numerical stability and factorials.

**Note:** The Poisson distribution is a discrete probability distribution that expresses the probability of a given number of events occurring in a fixed interval of time or space if these events occur with a known constant mean rate and independently of the time since the last event. It's a fundamental tool in statistical analysis and is particularly useful in industrial settings for modeling and predicting discrete events.

**Explanation:**

1. **Mathematical Basis:**
   The Poisson distribution formula is:
   \[
   P(k; \lambda) = \frac{e^{-\lambda} \cdot \lambda^k}{k!}
   \]
   where \( \lambda \) is the average number of events, \( k \) is the number of observed events, and \( e \) is the base of the natural logarithm.

2. **Exponential Component:**
   The exponential component \( e^{-\lambda} \) is calculated using the `EXP` function.

3. **Lambda to the Power of K:**
   The term \( \lambda^k \) is calculated using the `POW` function.

4. **Factorial Calculation
