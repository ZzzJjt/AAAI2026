Consider that the program is executed cyclically in a task according to the 61131-3 programming model. Thus no explicit main loop is needed. Please fix the code by removing the 'LOOP'.

**R-I-S-E:**

🟥 R (Role – Who You Are)

You are a PLC engineer or control systems programmer responsible for maintaining and improving IEC 61131-3-based batch control logic for a polyethylene production process.

⸻

🟩 I (Input – What You Have)

You are given a Structured Text program that:
	•	Controls a multi-step batch process (raw material prep → polymerization → quenching → drying → pelletizing → QA → packaging)
	•	Uses a state variable and a TON timer for step durations
	•	Incorrectly contains a LOOP, despite the code being executed cyclically in a PLC scan cycle
	•	Repeats temperature and pressure setting logic with minimal abstraction

⸻

🟧 S (Steps – What You Need to Do)
	1.	Remove the LOOP: Replace it with cyclic logic conforming to the 61131-3 scan model.
	2.	Refactor repeated logic: Create or improve a method such as UpdateTemperaturesAndPressures() to centralize condition setting per state.
	3.	Standardize timer usage: Ensure each state:
	•	Initializes the timer on entry
	•	Evaluates timer.Q for completion
	•	Resets timer.IN and advances state properly
	4.	Improve structure and readability:
	•	Align comments and formatting
	•	Optionally extract each batch step into a function or method
	•	Group process parameters and state logic clearly

⸻

🟦 E (Expectation – What Success Looks Like)

A properly optimized program will:
	•	Comply with best practices of IEC 61131-3 (no LOOP, cyclic logic only)
	•	Be easier to read, maintain, and scale (e.g., adding steps or changing durations)
	•	Reliably advance batch steps using timers
	•	Promote reuse and modularity, such as methods for setting process conditions
	•	Enable safe execution and debugging by minimizing logic duplication and state inconsistencies

**Optimize Batch Control Logic:**

Please optimize the following batch control logic for a polyethylene production process. The logic should be structured in a self-contained method that handles the transition between each step of the process. The method should include a timer to control the duration of each step and a conditional statement to determine when to move to the next step. The timer should be initialized at the start of each step and should be reset when the step is complete. The method should also include comments to explain the purpose of each step and the conditions for transitioning to the next step. The logic should be written in IEC 61131-3 Structured Text, and the method should be named “PolyethyleneBatchControl”.
