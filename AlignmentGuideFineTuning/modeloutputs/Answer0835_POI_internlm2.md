### Intent:
**Intent Summary:**  
Develop an IEC 61131-3 Structured Text function block to reliably read five process values from an IO-Link master, with error handling and status reporting for robust communication.  

**Key Focus:**  
- IO-Link data acquisition  
- Error/status management  
- Real-time diagnostics  
- Structured Text (ST) compliance

### Prompt:
**IO-Link Data Acquisition Using 61131-3 Structured Text:**

Develop a function block in structured text (ST) based on IEC 61131 standards to read five values from a remote IO-Link master. The function block should handle communication with the IO-Link master, retrieve the required process data, and provide the status of each read operation. Discuss the methodology used for error checking, status reporting, and handling of potential communication issues between the IO-Link master and the connected devices.

**T-A-G:**

ðŸŸ¥ T (Task) â€“ What You Need to Do

Develop an IEC 61131-3 Structured Text (ST) function block to acquire five process values from a remote IO-Link master device.

ðŸŸ© A (Action) â€“ How to Do It

Implement logic to establish and manage communication with the IO-Link master. Sequentially or concurrently read five data points, verify the integrity of each response, and return both the values and their respective status indicators. Integrate error detection and reporting mechanisms to handle communication issues, such as timeouts or data corruption.

ðŸŸ¦ G (Goal) â€“ What You Want to Achieve

Ensure accurate and reliable acquisition of IO-Link data, with clear status feedback for each value, enabling the controller to act on real-time diagnostics and maintain robust system behavior even in the presence of communication faults.

Ensure accurate and reliable acquisition of IO-Link data, with clear status feedback for each value, enabling the controller to act on real-time diagnostics and maintain robust system behavior even in the presence of communication faults. 

**Methodology:**

1. **Establishing Communication:**
   - Use the IO-Link library provided by the IO-Link master manufacturer to establish a connection with the master device.
   - Implement a connection setup function block that initializes the IO-Link connection, sets up the required parameters, and verifies the connection status.

2. **Data Acquisition:**
   - Define a function block to read the five process values from the IO-Link master.
   - Use the IO-Link library to send a read request for each value, specifying the data type and address.
   - Implement error checking mechanisms to handle potential issues, such as timeouts or data corruption.
   - Store the received data in local variables and return the values and their respective status indicators.

3. **Error Handling and Status Reporting:**
   - Implement a function block to handle errors and report the status of each read operation.
   - Use the IO-Link library to check for any communication errors, such as timeouts or data corruption.
   - Return the status of each read operation, indicating whether the data was successfully acquired or if an error occurred.
   - Integrate real-time diagnostics to provide immediate feedback on the status of the IO-Link communication and data acquisition.

4. **Real-Time Diagnostics:**
   - Use the status indicators returned by the function block to trigger alarms or notifications in the controller.
   - Implement logic to monitor the status of each read operation and take appropriate actions based on the status.
   - Configure the controller to continuously check the status of the IO-Link communication and data acquisition, ensuring real-time diagnostics.

5. **Compliance with IEC 61131-3:**
   - Ensure that the function block is compliant with the IEC 61131-3 standard for Structured Text.
   - Follow the syntax, data types, and programming rules defined in the standard.
   - Test the function block using the IEC 61131-3 test suite to verify its compliance.

**Example Implementation:**
