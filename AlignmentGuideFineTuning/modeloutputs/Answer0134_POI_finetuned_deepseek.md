ðŸŸ¥ Before â€“ The Context or Need

You have a Structured Text (IEC 61131-3) PLC program named UreaReactionControl, which manages a two-step urea synthesis process. The code controls the opening of ammonia and COâ‚‚ valves, monitors reactor pressure and temperature, and times the reaction. However, this logic is currently undocumented, making it harder for developers, maintainers, or auditors to understand and work with the process flow.

	â€¢	Function of each variable (inputs, outputs, internal, and parameters)
	â€¢	Step-by-step description of the process flow:
	â€¢	Step 1: Loading raw materials

	â€¢	Completion: Finalizing the reaction
	â€¢	Conditions under which valves are opened or closed

# PID Control System Documentation

## Overview

The PID control system is designed to regulate the pressure of a vessel by controlling the flow of a fluid through a valve. The system consists of two loops: an inner loop for PID control of the valve, and an outer loop for monitoring the vessel pressure. The inner loop uses PID control to adjust the valve position based on the setpoint and error, while the outer loop uses a safety limit to prevent overpressure.

## Inner Loop: PID Control of the Valve

### Inputs

- `rCurrentPressure`: Current pressure of the vessel in bars
- `rTargetPressure`: Desired pressure setpoint in bars
- `rPressureTolerance`: Tolerance for the pressure setpoint
- `rCurrentFlow`: Current flow rate of the fluid in liters/min
- `rFlowTolerance`: Tolerance for the flow rate setpoint
- `rStepSize`: Step size for PID control
- `rPIDKp`: Proportional gain for the PID controller
- `rPIDKi`: Integral gain for the PID controller
- `rPIDKd`: Derivative gain for the PID controller
- `rPIDOutput`: Output of the PID controller

### Outputs

- `stValveControl`: TRUE to open the valve, FALSE to close it
- `rPIDOutput`: Output of the PID controller

### Logic

The inner loop uses PID control to regulate the valve position based on the pressure setpoint and error. The PID controller is configured with the following parameters:

- `rPIDKp`: Proportional gain (0.1 to 10.0)
- `rPIDKi`: Integral gain (0.0 to 10.0)
- `rPIDKd`: Derivative gain (0.0 to 10.0)
- `rPIDOutput`: Output of the PID controller (0.0 to 100.0)

The PID controller is configured to output a valve position based on the error between the setpoint and the current pressure. The valve
