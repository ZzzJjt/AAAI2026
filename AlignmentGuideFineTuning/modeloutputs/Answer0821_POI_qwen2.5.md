### Intent:
**Intent Summary:**  
Create a Structured Text function block to dynamically register/deregister CANOpen PDOs (Process Data Objects) or Layer 2 messages, with options to clear all registrations and buffer data, while ensuring robust error handling and network stability.  

*(Focus: CANOpen PDO management via ST, runtime flexibility, and safety.)*

### Prompt:
**CANOpen PDO Registration Using 61131-3 Structured Text:**

Develop a structured text (ST) function block named CAN_REGISTER_COBID based on IEC 61131 standards. The block will be responsible for registering or deleting a PDO (Process Data Object) or CAN Layer 2 message for reception by the network layer. When the REGISTER input is set to TRUE, the specified COBID (CAN identifier) will be registered for receiving messages. If REGISTER is set to FALSE, the registration of the respective COBID will be deleted. Additionally, when REGISTER is FALSE and COBID is set to 0, all registrations and messages stored in the network layer buffer will be cleared. Discuss the function blockâ€™s implementation, including error handling, network communication management, and memory buffer clearing mechanisms.

**T-A-G:**

ðŸŸ¥ T (Task) â€“ What You Need to Do

Design a Structured Text (ST) function block named CAN_REGISTER_COBID using the IEC 61131-3 standard to manage registration and deregistration of PDOs or CAN Layer 2 messages in a CANOpen network.

ðŸŸ© A (Action) â€“ How to Do It

Implement logic so that when REGISTER = TRUE, the function block registers the specified COBID for receiving messages. When REGISTER = FALSE, it removes the registration. If REGISTER = FALSE and COBID = 0, the function block should clear all registrations and network buffer data. Include robust error handling, communication status checks, and safe memory buffer management within the function block.

ðŸŸ¦ G (Goal) â€“ What Success Looks Like

Enable dynamic and reliable management of CANOpen message registrations during runtime, ensuring communication stability, flexibility, and system safety across changing operational requirements.

**Function Block Implementation:**

```structuredtext
FUNCTION_BLOCK CAN_REGISTER_COBID
VAR_INPUT
    REGISTER : BOOL; // TRUE to register, FALSE to deregister
    COBID : WORD; // CAN identifier to register or deregister
    CLEAR_ALL : BOOL; // TRUE to clear all registrations and buffer
END_VAR

VAR_OUTPUT
    STATUS : BOOL; // TRUE if operation successful, FALSE otherwise
END_VAR

VAR
    CAN_COMMUNICATION : BOOL; // Status of CAN communication
    BUFFER_CLEAR : BOOL; // Flag to indicate buffer clear operation
    PDO_REGISTERED : BOOL; // Flag to indicate PDO registration status
    PDO_DEREGISTERED : BOOL; // Flag to indicate PDO deregistration status
    PDO_BUFFER_CLEARED : BOOL; // Flag to indicate PDO buffer clear status
END_VAR

// Initialize variables
PDO_REGISTERED := FALSE;
PDO_DEREGISTERED := FALSE;
PDO_BUFFER_CLEARED := FALSE;

// Check if CAN communication is active
IF CAN_COMMUNICATION THEN
    // Check if CLEAR_ALL is TRUE
    IF CLEAR_ALL THEN
        // Clear all registrations and buffer
        PDO_BUFFER_CLEARED := TRUE;
        PDO_REGISTERED := FALSE;
        PDO_DEREGISTERED := FALSE;
    ELSE
        // Check if REGISTER is TRUE
        IF REGISTER THEN
            // Register COBID
            PDO_REGISTERED := TRUE;
        ELSE
            // Deregister COBID
            PDO_DEREGISTERED := TRUE;
        END_IF;
    END_IF;
ELSE
    // Handle CAN communication error
    STATUS := FALSE;
END_IF;

// Set STATUS based on operation success
STATUS := PDO_REGISTERED OR PDO_DEREGISTERED OR PDO_BUFFER_CLEARED;
```

**Error Handling and Network Stability:**

- **CAN Communication Status:** The function block checks the status of CAN communication before performing any operations. If communication is not active, it sets the STATUS to FALSE, indicating an error.
- **Buffer Clear Operation:** When CLEAR_ALL is TRUE, the function block clears the PDO buffer and sets the PDO_BUFFER_CLEARED flag to TRUE. This ensures that all stored messages are removed, maintaining network stability.
- **PDO Registration/Deregistration:** The function block sets the PDO_REGISTERED and PDO_DEREGISTERED flags based on the REGISTER input. This allows the function block to track the registration status of PDOs,
