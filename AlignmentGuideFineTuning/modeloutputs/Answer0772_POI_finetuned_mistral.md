### Intent:
**Intent Summary:**  
Develop an ISA-88-compliant Structured Text program to automate the "Reaction" step in adhesive batch production, including temperature control, mixing, and timed phase transitions while adhering to modular design principles.

### Prompt:
**Batch Adhesive:**

Develop an ISA-88 batch control recipe for the production of adhesive, detailing the stages involved in the process. Create a self-contained program in IEC 61131-3 Structured Text to manage the sequential control of step B.2, Reaction, with specific process parameters and timers. Include the necessary control logic to call methods corresponding to each phase of the reaction, ensuring that transitions between steps are managed through appropriate conditions and timer values.

Incorporate detailed content for calling the methods that govern specific operations, such as heating, mixing, and maintaining the reaction environment. Additionally, discuss the integration of ISA-88 standards in batch process control, focusing on how the structured text program facilitates modularity and flexibility in controlling the adhesive production process.

**R-T-F:**

ðŸŸ¥ R (Role) â€“ Define Your Role

Act as a batch automation engineer specializing in ISA-88 recipe implementation using IEC 61131-3 Structured Text.

ðŸŸ© T (Task) â€“ Define the Objective

Develop an ISA-88-compliant batch control recipe for adhesive production. Specifically, implement step B.2: Reaction as a self-contained Structured Text program. The program should include:
	â€¢	Defined process parameters (e.g., temperature, mixing speed, hold time)
	â€¢	Timers for each operation phase
	â€¢	Sequential logic to manage phase transitions
	â€¢	Method calls for operations such as heating, mixing, and maintaining the reaction environment
You should also describe how the program reflects ISA-88 principles like modularity, reusability, and clarity.

ðŸŸ§ F (Format) â€“ Specify the Output Format

Provide:
	â€¢	A Structured Text code block that manages the Reaction step
	â€¢	Clearly defined variables and timers
	â€¢	Calls to modular methods or function blocks (e.g., StartHeating, StartMixing)
	â€¢	In-line comments explaining transitions and control logic
	â€¢	A brief discussion of how the code adheres to ISA-88 standards for procedural control
