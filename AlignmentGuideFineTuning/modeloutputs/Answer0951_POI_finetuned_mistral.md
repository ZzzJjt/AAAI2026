### Intent:
**Intent Summary:**  
Develop an IEC 61131-3 Structured Text program to manage the sequential start-up (activating heating/cooling stations, feeders, and synchronized cutters) and shutdown (safe deactivation with tension control) of a 3D pouch making machine, ensuring winding tension stability and process safety.

### Prompt:
**3D Pouch Making Machine:**

Design a detailed start-up and shutdown sequence for a 3D pouch making machine in IEC 61131-3 Structured Text. The machine consists of 8 heating stations, 8 cooling stations, one horizontal cutter, one vertical cutter, and two feeder units responsible for raw material feeding. Winding tension management is critical throughout the process to ensure proper tension in the raw material.

Write a structured start-up sequence that sequentially activates the heating and cooling stations, regulates the feeder units to maintain optimal tension, and ensures proper synchronization between the cutters and material flow. Additionally, create a shutdown sequence that safely deactivates each component in the correct order, ensuring proper cooling and tension release.

Ensure the program includes typical parameter values, timers, and conditions for each stage of the start-up and shutdown procedures, and discuss the importance of winding tension in maintaining machine efficiency and product quality.

**T-A-G:**

ðŸŸ¥ T (Task)

Develop a Structured Text (ST) control program for managing the start-up and shutdown sequences of a 3D pouch making machine using the IEC 61131-3 standard.

ðŸŸ© A (Action)

Create logic that sequentially powers on 8 heating stations and 8 cooling stations, regulates two feeder units to maintain winding tension, and synchronizes a horizontal and vertical cutter with material movement. Incorporate timers, parameter thresholds, and interlocks to ensure safe and efficient startup. Similarly, implement a structured shutdown sequence that gradually deactivates each component in reverse orderâ€”ensuring proper cooling and safe tension release. Include annotated code to explain each step and logic condition.

ðŸŸ¦ G (Goal)

Ensure the machine operates safely and efficiently under varying production conditions. The resulting program should maintain stable tension, prevent equipment damage, and preserve product quality throughout both start-up and shutdown procedures.
