Create a self-contained program in IEC 61131-3 Structured Text to manage the sequential control of step B.2, Reaction, with specific process parameters and timers. Include the necessary control logic to call methods corresponding to each phase of the reaction, ensuring that transitions between steps are managed through appropriate conditions and timer values.

Incorporate detailed content for calling the methods that govern specific operations, such as heating, mixing, and maintaining the reaction environment. Additionally, discuss the integration of ISA-88 standards in batch process control, focusing on how the structured text program facilitates modularity and flexibility in controlling the adhesive production process.

ðŸŸ¥ T (Task)

Develop an ISA-88-compliant batch control recipe for the production of adhesive, focusing on step B.2: Reaction.

ðŸŸ© A (Action)

Implement a self-contained Structured Text program in IEC 61131-3 that manages the sequential execution of the Reaction step. Define process parameters and timers for each phase of the reaction, and include logic to call modular methods such as StartHeating, StartMixing, and HoldReaction. Use conditional checks and timer values to control transitions between these phases. Ensure the code structure is modular and maintainable, in alignment with ISA-88 principles.

**R-I-S-E:**

Role

Batch control engineer or PLC programmer responsible for implementing ISA-88-compliant batch control logic in IEC 61131-3 Structured Text.

Input

Batch process documentation, ISA-88 standards, and a list of required methods (e.g., heating, mixing, reaction timing) to call during the Reaction phase.

Steps

	1.	Define the process stages and parameters for the Reaction phase (e.g., temperature, mixing speed, timing).
	2.	Create a self-contained program in IEC 61131-3 Structured Text that sequentially controls each stage of the Reaction process.
