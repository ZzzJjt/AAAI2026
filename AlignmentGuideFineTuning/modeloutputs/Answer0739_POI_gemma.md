### Intent:
**Intent Summary:**  
Create a reusable IEC 61131-3 function block to compute the sine of an angle (in radians) using either a native `SIN()` function or a Taylor series approximation (7th-order), with documentation on precision, limitations, and real-time PLC optimization.  

*(Focus: Modular sine calculation for industrial motion/signal applications where native support may be lacking.)*

### Prompt:
**Sine Function**

Develop a self-contained function block in IEC 61131-3 Structured Text to compute the sine of a given angle in radians. Ensure that the function block is modular and reusable, with appropriate comments detailing the mathematical operations involved. Include a discussion on the precision of the sine function within the context of PLC programming and its potential limitations in real-time applications.

ðŸŸ¥ R (Role) â€“ Your Role

You are a PLC control engineer or automation programmer developing core trigonometric utilities in IEC 61131-3 Structured Text to support real-time industrial applications such as motion control, signal generation, and waveform analysis.

ðŸŸ© T (Task) â€“ What You Need to Do

Create a self-contained function block named SineFunction that:
	â€¢	Computes the sine of a given angle expressed in radians
	â€¢	Uses the built-in SIN() function if available
	â€¢	Alternatively, approximates sine using a Taylor series expansion up to the 7th power term for environments without native support
	â€¢	Accepts one input:
	â€¢	AngleRad : REAL â€” the angle in radians
	â€¢	Returns one output:
	â€¢	SineValue : REAL â€” the computed sine value
	â€¢	Is fully documented with inline comments explaining:
	â€¢	The mathematical basis for the sine function
	â€¢	Why radians (not degrees) are used
	â€¢	The range, convergence characteristics, and error limitations of the Taylor series approximation
	â€¢	Is optimized for real-time execution on PLCs, using no recursion and fixed iteration logic

ðŸŸ§ F (Format) â€“ Expected Output

You should produce a readable, efficient, and reusable IEC 61131-3 Structured Text function block like:

FUNCTION_BLOCK SineFunction
VAR_INPUT
    AngleRad : REAL;
END_VAR
VAR_OUTPUT
    SineValue : REAL;
END_VAR
VAR
    x, x2, x3, x5, x7 : REAL;
END_VAR

// Use Taylor Series approximation if SIN() is unavailable
x := AngleRad;
x2 := x * x;
x3 := x2 * x;
x5 := x3 * x2;
x7 := x5 * x2;
SineValue := x - (x3 / 6.0) + (x5 / 120.0) - (x7 / 5040.0);

// Note: For large inputs, consider normalizing to -PI..PI

This function block is suitable for real-time control tasks where trigonometric functions are required but platform support is limited. Itâ€™s a reliable and maintainable tool for implementing smooth motion curves, phase-based timing, or signal shaping directly within PLC logic.
