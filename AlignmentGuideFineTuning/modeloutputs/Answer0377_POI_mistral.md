### Intent:
**Intent Summary:**  
Create a reusable PID controller function block in IEC 61131-3 Structured Text with configurable gains, anti-windup protection, output clamping, and runtime tuning capability for industrial automation applications.  

*(Focus: Modular, robust, and tunable PID implementation for PLCs.)*

### Prompt:
**PID Controller:**
Implement a self-contained function block in IEC 61131-3 structured text to create a PID controller. Include configurable parameters for proportional, integral, and derivative gains, with error handling and tuning capability.

**C-A-R-E:**

🟥 C (Context) – Background Situation

Proportional–Integral–Derivative (PID) controllers are essential in industrial automation for maintaining desired process conditions such as temperature, pressure, and flow. In a PLC environment, implementing a reliable and tunable PID algorithm in IEC 61131-3 Structured Text requires careful attention to execution safety, tuning flexibility, and prevention of issues like integral windup and unstable output response.

🟩 A (Action) – Task to Perform

Develop a self-contained PID controller function block in Structured Text that includes:
	•	Configurable gain inputs:
	•	Kp : REAL (proportional gain)
	•	Ki : REAL (integral gain)
	•	Kd : REAL (derivative gain)
	•	Real-time error calculation between setpoint and process variable
	•	Implementation of:
	•	Integral term accumulation with anti-windup protection
	•	Derivative action using past process variable
	•	Output limits to prevent overcorrection
	•	Inputs for Enable and Reset to control runtime execution
	•	Optional tuning modes for gain adjustment during operation

⸻

🟨 R (Result) – Expected Outcome

The function block should deliver stable and responsive control output across a range of operating conditions. It should be:
	•	Scan-cycle safe and robust against input noise
	•	Easy to integrate into broader control programs
	•	Modular, with clear inputs and outputs
	•	Suitable for use in both simulation and real-time industrial control applications

🟦 E (Example) – Concrete Illustration

Example logic structure:

IF Enable THEN
   Error := Setpoint - ProcessVariable;

   // Integral with anti-windup
   IF NOT Windup THEN
      Integral := Integral + (Ki * Error * DeltaT);
   END_IF;

   // Derivative
   Derivative := (ProcessVariable - PrevProcessVariable) / DeltaT;

   // PID output
   Output := Kp * Error + Integral - Kd * Derivative;

   // Clamping
   IF Output > MaxOutput THEN
      Output := MaxOutput;
      Windup := TRUE;
   ELSIF Output < MinOutput THEN
      Output := MinOutput;
      Windup := TRUE;
   ELSE
      Windup := FALSE;
   END_IF;
END_IF;

Inputs:
	•	Setpoint, ProcessVariable, Kp, Ki, Kd, Enable, Reset, MinOutput, MaxOutput

Outputs:
	•	Output, optionally Error, Integral, Derivative

🟦 E (Explanation) – Rationale

The example logic structure demonstrates a basic PID controller with anti-windup protection, output clamping, and runtime tuning capability. The function block can be easily integrated into a larger control program by simply calling it with the required inputs.

The optional tuning modes can be implemented by adding additional logic to adjust the gains based on performance metrics such as overshoot, settling time, and steady-state error. This allows for fine-tuning the controller during operation without requiring a complete rewrite of the control program.

By using clear and modular inputs and outputs, the PID controller function block can be easily adapted to various control applications, making it a versatile tool for industrial automation.
