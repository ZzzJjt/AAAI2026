### Intent:
**Intent Summary:**  
Develop an IEC 61131-3 Structured Text program to safely and gradually shut down a steel production facility by controlling furnace temperature, fuel gas flow (ramped down over 12 hours), and oxygen levels (maintaining a 1:2.5 fuel-to-air ratio), with modular functions for sequencing and safety interlocks.

### Prompt:
**Shutdown Steel Production:**

Develop a comprehensive list of steps for the controlled shutdown of a steel production facility. Include key stages such as reducing furnace temperature, controlling gas flow rates, and maintaining safe oxygen levels throughout the shutdown process.

Provide a detailed control narrative for steps 4 to 6 of the shutdown sequence, specifying concrete ranges and setpoints for variables such as temperature, gas flow, and oxygen levels.

Write a self-contained IEC 61131-3 Structured Text program based on this control narrative, ensuring proper sequencing and safety protocols.

Additionally, create a function in IEC 61131-3 to gradually reduce the fuel gas flow rate to the furnace burners over a period of 12 hours. This function should incorporate timing and safety checks to ensure smooth transitions.

Lastly, write an IEC 61131-3 function for adjusting the oxygen supply to the burners to maintain a precise fuel-to-air ratio of 1:2.5 during the shutdown. Ensure the function is adaptable to fluctuations in gas flow and temperature, and include safeguards for maintaining combustion efficiency.

**Control Narrative for Steps 4 to 6:**

**Step 4: Gradual Temperature Reduction**
- Target temperature: 400Â°C
- Safety interlock: If temperature exceeds 450Â°C, halt the process and trigger an alarm.

**Step 5: Fuel Gas Flow Ramp-Down**
- Initial flow rate: 100%
- Final flow rate: 0%
- Duration: 12 hours
- Safety interlock: If flow rate drops below 50% and temperature exceeds 350Â°C, halt the process and trigger an alarm.

**Step 6: Oxygen Adjustment**
- Initial ratio: 1:2.5
- Safety interlock: If ratio deviates by more than 0.1, halt the process and trigger an alarm.
