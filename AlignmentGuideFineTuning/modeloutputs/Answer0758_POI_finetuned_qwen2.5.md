### Intent:
**Intent Summary:**  
Develop an IEC 61131-3 Structured Text program for PID-based chemical pH control that adjusts dosing rates using scaled error calculations, anti-windup protection, and input validation to maintain a target pH of 7.0 within safe operational limits.

### Prompt:
**PID Temperature Control Gas Turbine:**

Develop a self-contained IEC 61131-3 Structured Text program to implement PID feedback control for regulating the temperature inside a gas turbine. The control program should manage the opening of an inlet valve based on a temperature setpoint, ensuring that the PID controller adjusts the valve position to maintain optimal turbine performance.

The program should include the necessary PID parameters (proportional, integral, and derivative gains) and logic to handle deviations from the temperature setpoint. Also, incorporate limits on the valve opening to ensure safe operation. Discuss the challenges of temperature regulation in gas turbines, focusing on system dynamics, response time, and maintaining stability under varying load conditions.

ðŸŸ¥ R (Role) â€“ Your Role

ðŸŸ© T (Task) â€“ What You Need to Do

Create a self-contained IEC 61131-3 Structured Text program (not a function block) that performs the following:
	1.	Continuously monitors turbine temperature (Temp_PV)
	2.	Compares it with a setpoint (Temp_SP := 950.0)
	3.	Calculates a PID output using:
	â€¢	Kp := 3.0 (Proportional gain)
	â€¢	Ki := 0.7 (Integral gain)
	â€¢	Kd := 0.2 (Derivative gain)
	4.	Computes output every 100 ms, adjusting the inlet valve opening
	5.	Clamps the output to ensure the valve stays within the safe operating range (0.0 to 100.0 percent)
	6.	Stores the previous error for derivative computation

    Temp_SP : REAL := 950.0;           // Setpoint (Â°C)

    // PID tuning parameters
    Kp : REAL := 3.0;
    Ki : REAL := 0.7;

    Valve_Position : REAL;

    // Output limits
    Valve_Min : REAL := 0.0;
    Valve_Max : REAL := 100.0;
END_VAR

// PID calculation (100 ms sampling time)
Error := Temp_SP - Temp_PV;
Integral := Integral + Error * 0.1;
