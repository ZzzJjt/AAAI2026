### Intent:
**Intent Summary:**  
Create an IEC 61131-3 ST function block to read five process values from an IO-Link master, including communication handling, error checking, and status reporting for each value.  

*(Key focus: IO-Link data acquisition with robust error handling and status feedback.)*

### Prompt:
**IO-Link Data Acquisition Using 61131-3 Structured Text:**

Develop a function block in structured text (ST) based on IEC 61131 standards to read five values from a remote IO-Link master. The function block should handle communication with the IO-Link master, retrieve the required process data, and provide the status of each read operation. Discuss the methodology used for error checking, status reporting, and handling of potential communication issues between the IO-Link master and the connected devices.

**R-T-F:**

ðŸŸ¥ R (Role) â€“ Your Role

Act as a PLC programmer developing communication function blocks using IEC 61131-3 Structured Text for IO-Link-based industrial systems.

ðŸŸ© T (Task) â€“ What You Need to Do

Create a function block that reads five process values from a remote IO-Link master. The block should manage communication with the IO-Link master, retrieve and store the values, and return the status of each read operation. It should also include error handling and reporting logic to deal with potential communication issues such as timeouts, invalid responses, or device errors.

ðŸŸ§ F (Format) â€“ Expected Output

Provide an IEC 61131-3 compliant ST function block that includes:
	â€¢	Inputs: read trigger, IO-Link addresses or indexes
	â€¢	Outputs: five process values and corresponding read status indicators
	â€¢	Logic for handling communication requests and parsing IO-Link responses
	â€¢	Error-checking mechanisms and status reporting per value
	â€¢	Well-commented code for easy maintenance and integration
