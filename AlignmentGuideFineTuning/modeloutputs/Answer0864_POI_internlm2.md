**Example Application:**

Suppose a chemical plant needs to blend two raw materials (A and B) to produce a final product (C) with specific properties. The plant has constraints on the amount of each raw material that can be used, as well as a target property for the final product. The objective is to minimize the cost of raw materials while meeting the target property.

Using the SimplexSolver function block, the plant can input the coefficients for the objective function (cost of raw materials), the constraint matrix (raw material limits), and the right-hand side values (target property). The function block will then output the optimal blend ratio for raw materials A and B, the cost of the final product, and a status flag indicating whether the problem was solved successfully.

**Limitations and Considerations:**

1. **Memory and Processing Power:** The SimplexSolver function block should be designed to handle the memory and processing constraints of the target PLC. This may involve limiting the size of the input matrices, using efficient data structures, and optimizing the algorithm for speed.
2. **Floating-Point Accuracy:** The Simplex method relies on floating-point arithmetic, which can introduce rounding errors and precision issues. These should be addressed by using appropriate data types and implementing techniques like scaling and normalization to mitigate the impact of floating-point inaccuracies.
3. **Fixed Matrix Sizes:** To ensure safe memory usage, the function block may need to enforce fixed matrix sizes. This can limit the flexibility of the function block, but it is necessary to prevent memory overflows and ensure predictable behavior.
4. **Execution Time Constraints:** Real-time PLCs have strict execution time constraints. The SimplexSolver function block should be designed to meet these constraints, either by optimizing the algorithm for speed or by offloading computationally intensive steps to a separate processor or external system.
5. **Handling Infeasible Solutions:** The Simplex method may encounter infeasible solutions, where the constraints cannot be satisfied simultaneously. The function block should handle these cases gracefully, either by returning an error status or by providing alternative solutions (e.g., closest feasible solution).

By addressing these limitations and considerations, the SimplexSolver function block can be a powerful tool for on-device optimization in industrial control systems.
