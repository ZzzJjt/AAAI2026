### Intent:
**Intent Summary:**  
Develop an IEC 61131-3 Structured Text PID controller to maintain precise 3 ppm chlorine dosing in water treatment by adjusting chemical injection in real-time (100 ms sampling) with tuned gains and safety limits, ensuring stable and compliant disinfection.  

*(Focus: PID control, real-time flow adaptation, safety constraints, water treatment compliance.)*

### Prompt:
**PID Flow Control Water Treatment:**

Develop a self-contained IEC 61131-3 Structured Text program to implement PID feedback control for chemical dosing in a water treatment process. The program should regulate the dosing rate of chlorine at 3 ppm, adjusting based on real-time flow measurements with a sampling rate of 100 ms.

The control logic should include PID parameters (proportional, integral, and derivative gains) that are tuned for maintaining the desired dosing concentration. Ensure the program accounts for any deviations from the setpoint and adjusts the chemical dosing accordingly, while including safety limits to prevent overdosing or underdosing. Discuss the importance of precise flow control in water treatment, with a focus on maintaining safe and effective chemical levels.

**B-A-B:**

ðŸŸ¥ B (Before) â€“ The Challenge

In water treatment processes, maintaining the correct chlorine dosing level is critical to ensure safe disinfection without risking overdosing or chemical waste. Traditional manual or open-loop systems lack the responsiveness to adapt to real-time fluctuations in water flow, leading to poor dosing precision, regulatory noncompliance, or safety risks.

ðŸŸ© A (After) â€“ The Ideal Outcome

Develop a self-contained IEC 61131-3 Structured Text program that:
	â€¢	Implements PID feedback control to regulate the chlorine dosing rate based on a real-time water flow measurement.
	â€¢	Maintains a target concentration of 3 ppm, with a sampling rate of 100 ms.
	â€¢	Automatically corrects for deviations from the setpoint using tuned proportional, integral, and derivative gains.
	â€¢	Includes safety limits to prevent overdosing or underdosing.
	â€¢	Ensures accurate, stable, and compliant water quality in both low and high-flow conditions.

    Dosing_Output := Min_Dose;
END_IF
