### Intent:
**Intent Summary:**  
Develop an OPC UA client in C, encapsulate it as an IEC 61131-3 function block (ST) with Execute/Timeout inputs and status/error outputs, enabling PLCs to securely connect to OPC UA servers with managed communication and error handling.  

*(Focus: Bridging C-based OPC UA functionality to PLC logic via standardized FB interface.)*

### Prompt:
**OPC UA Client Implementation Using C and IEC 61131-3 Structured Text:**

Develop C-code for an OPC UA client, then wrap it into an IEC 61131-based function block written in structured text (ST). The function block should have the following input pins: Execute (type: BOOL), ServerUrl (type: STRING[255]), and Timeout (type: TIME). The output pins should include Done (type: BOOL), Busy (type: BOOL), Error (type: BOOL), and ErrorID (type: DWORD). In your explanation, describe how the C-code interfaces with the OPC UA server, how the function block manages communication with the server, and how error handling is implemented. Provide details on how to integrate this function block within an IEC 61131-3 environment for reliable client-server communication.

**C-A-R-E:**

ðŸŸ¥ C (Context) â€“ The Background

OPC UA is a widely adopted communication standard for industrial automation, offering secure, platform-independent connectivity between devices and control systems. However, many PLC environments lack built-in OPC UA client functionality, requiring custom integration using external C libraries and Structured Text (ST) to bridge the communication between the PLC and the OPC UA server.

â¸»

ðŸŸ© A (Action) â€“ The Implementation Task

Develop a C-based OPC UA client using a standard library (e.g., open62541) to manage connections, requests, and responses with an OPC UA server. Wrap this client logic into a callable module and expose it to an IEC 61131-3 environment as a Structured Text function block. The function block should include:

Inputs:
	â€¢	Execute (BOOL) â€“ Triggers the connection process
	â€¢	ServerUrl (STRING[255]) â€“ Specifies the target OPC UA server
	â€¢	Timeout (TIME) â€“ Defines the allowable wait period for connection

Outputs:
	â€¢	Done (BOOL) â€“ Indicates successful execution
	â€¢	Busy (BOOL) â€“ Signals ongoing communication
	â€¢	Error (BOOL) â€“ Flags any failure during execution
	â€¢	ErrorID (DWORD) â€“ Returns the relevant error code

The function block must manage internal communication state, map C return values to PLC-readable flags, and provide predictable results for integration into deterministic control logic.

â¸»

ðŸŸ¨ R (Result) â€“ The Expected Outcome

The resulting solution enables a PLC program to reliably initiate and manage OPC UA client connections, with built-in execution control and error handling. It provides clear status feedback to the automation engineer, allowing seamless integration into broader machine or process workflows that rely on real-time data exchange over OPC UA.

â¸»

ðŸŸ¦ E (Example) â€“ A Practical Use Case

For example, in a production line application, the ST program sets Execute := TRUE to start a connection to the OPC UA server at opc.tcp://192.168.1.100:4840. The C client handles the session creation. If successful, Done := TRUE is set and process variables are exchanged. If the server is unavailable or times out, Error := TRUE and ErrorID := 0x02 (e.g., timeout) are returned, enabling the PLC to trigger a retry or alarm without freezing execution.

â¸»

ðŸŸ© E (Explanation) â€“ The Connection Process

1. The PLC program calls the OPC UA function block with Execute := TRUE.
2. The function block initializes the C client with ServerUrl := "opc.tcp://192.168.1.100:4840" and Timeout := 5 seconds.
3. The C client creates a connection to the specified OPC UA server.
4. If the connection is successful, the function block sets Done := TRUE and Busy := TRUE.
5. The C client exchanges process variables with the server.
6. If the exchange is successful, the function block sets Done := TRUE and Busy := FALSE.
7. The C client closes the connection.
8. The function block sets Error := FALSE and ErrorID := 0.
9. If the connection fails or the server is unavailable, the function block sets Done := FALSE, Busy := FALSE, and Error := TRUE.
10. The function block sets ErrorID := 0x02 (e.g., timeout).
11. The PLC program can react to the error status, e.g., by retrying the connection or triggering an alarm.

â¸»

ðŸŸ© E (Explanation) â€“ Error Handling

The C client handles errors by returning error codes from the open62541 library. The function block maps these error codes to PLC-readable flags (e.g., ErrorID := 0x02 maps to Error := TRUE). This mapping ensures that the PLC can interpret the error status in a predictable and meaningful way.

â¸»

ðŸŸ© E (Explanation) â€“ Integration

The OPC UA function block can be integrated into an IEC 61131-3 environment by calling the function block from a ST program. The function block's inputs and outputs are mapped to ST variables, and the function block's execution is triggered by a ST program statement. The ST program can then react to the function block's status outputs, e.g., by retrying the connection or triggering an alarm.
