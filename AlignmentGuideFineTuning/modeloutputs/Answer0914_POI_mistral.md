ðŸŸ© A (Action) â€“ How to Do It
	1.	Read sensor inputs for:
	â€¢	Flow_B â€“ the measured flow rate of Reactant B
	â€¢	Optional: Concentration_B, Temperature_B â€“ to enable dynamic compensation
	2.	Use feedforward logic to calculate the required flow rate of Reactant A using:
	â€¢	Flow_A_Setpoint := Desired_Ratio * Flow_B * Compensation_Factor
	3.	Apply compensation if concentration or temperature influences flow behavior, enabling more precise ratio control.
	4.	Send the calculated setpoint to the actuator controlling Reactant Aâ€™s pump or valve.

// Compensation_Factor := f(Concentration_B, Temperature_B);

// Output the calculated setpoint to the actuator
ACTUATOR_A := Flow_A_Setpoint;

**Safety Checks:**

Incorporate safety checks within the feedforward control program to ensure the system operates within safe limits and prevents dangerous conditions. These checks should include:

1.	Low and high flow rate limits for both Reactant A and B to prevent pump cavitation or overpressure.
2.	Temperature limits to protect the system and reactants from excessive heat or freezing.
3.	Concentration limits to prevent over- or under-concentration of the reactants, which could lead to suboptimal product quality or safety issues.
4.	Shutdown or emergency stop logic in case of critical errors or dangerous conditions.

**Real-Time Compensation:**

To further improve the performance of the feedforward control system, implement real-time compensation logic that adjusts the feedforward calculations based on the current state of the process. This can help account for changes in the properties of the reactants, such as viscosity or density, which may affect the desired flow rates.

For example, if the concentration of Reactant B increases, the system may need to reduce the flow rate of Reactant A to maintain the desired ratio. Similarly, if the temperature of Reactant B rises, the system may need to increase the flow rate of Reactant A to compensate for the reduced viscosity.

**Advantages of Feedforward Control:**

Feedforward control offers several advantages over traditional feedback control in mixing processes:

1.	Improved response time: By predicting and pre-adjusting the flow rates, feedforward control can respond more quickly to changes in input variables, reducing the time required to reach the desired setpoint.
2.	Reduced process variability: Feedforward control can help maintain a more consistent product quality by minimizing the effects of disturbances on the process.
3.	Reduced reliance on feedback: By using feedforward control, the system can operate more independently of feedback loops, reducing the potential for delays and instability.
4.	Improved energy efficiency: By accurately predicting the required flow rates, feedforward control can help minimize energy waste and optimize the overall efficiency of the process.
