### Intent:
**Intent Summary:**  
Develop an ISA-88-compliant batch control program in IEC 61131-3 Structured Text to automate the reaction stage (B.2) of adhesive production, including heating, pressure maintenance, and cooling operations, with modular function blocks for process control and safety.

### Prompt:
**Batch Adhesive:**

Develop an ISA-88 batch control recipe for the production of adhesive, detailing the stages involved in the process. Create a self-contained program in IEC 61131-3 Structured Text to manage the sequential control of step B.2, Reaction, with specific process parameters and timers. Include the necessary control logic to call methods corresponding to each phase of the reaction, ensuring that transitions between steps are managed through appropriate conditions and timer values.

Incorporate detailed content for calling the methods that govern specific operations, such as heating, mixing, and maintaining the reaction environment. Additionally, discuss the integration of ISA-88 standards in batch process control, focusing on how the structured text program facilitates modularity and flexibility in controlling the adhesive production process.

**B-A-B:**

ðŸŸ¥ B (Before) â€“ The Problem or Challenge

In batch adhesive production, managing complex reaction steps requires precise sequencing, parameter handling, and flexible control logic. Without a structured approach like ISA-88, batch processes may become difficult to scale, reuse, or maintainâ€”especially when reaction conditions (such as heating, mixing, and holding) need to be tightly coordinated and monitored in real time.

ðŸŸ© A (After) â€“ The Desired Outcome

Design an ISA-88-compliant batch control recipe for adhesive manufacturing, specifically focusing on step B.2: Reaction. Develop a self-contained IEC 61131-3 Structured Text program to control this step, incorporating process parameters, timers, and conditions to manage transitions between sub-phases. The program should modularly invoke operations such as heating, mixing, and maintaining the reaction environment, with logic that reflects the structured and flexible nature of ISA-88.

ðŸŸ§ B (Bridge) â€“ How to Get There

Start by outlining the stages in the adhesive batch recipe, then focus on the Reaction step (B.2). Implement structured methods or function blocks for each key operation and build the sequencing logic using timers and conditional transitions. Use Structured Text to write modular, reusable code that aligns with ISA-88 principles of procedural abstraction and modularity. Conclude with a discussion on how this approach supports better maintainability, reusability, and clarity in batch process automation.
