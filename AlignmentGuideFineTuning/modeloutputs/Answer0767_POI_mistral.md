**Object-oriented 61131-3:**

In IEC 61131-3 Version 3.0, the concept of classes and methods is introduced to provide a more structured and modular approach to programming industrial automation systems.

**Classes and Methods:**

A class is a blueprint for creating objects, defining their attributes (variables) and behaviors (functions or methods). In ST, a class is defined using the `PROGRAM_DEFINITION` block with the `CLASS` keyword.

```st
PROGRAM_DEFINITION MyClass
  VAR_INPUT
    input1: BOOL;
  END_VAR

  VAR
    myVar: INT;
  END_VAR

  METHOD MyMethod
    myVar := input1;
  END_METHOD
END_PROGRAM
```

**Advantages:**

- Improved code organization and reusability
- Easier maintenance and debugging
- Reduced complexity in large systems

**Disadvantages:**

- Increased memory usage due to object creation
- Potential for increased complexity in understanding and debugging

**Inheritance:**

Inheritance allows a derived class to extend the functionality of a base class by inheriting its attributes and methods. In ST, this is achieved using the `EXTENDS` keyword in the `PROGRAM_DEFINITION` block.

```st
PROGRAM_DEFINITION MyDerivedClass EXTENDS MyClass
  METHOD MyMethod
    MyClass.MyMethod();
    myVar := myVar * 2;
  END_METHOD
END_PROGRAM
```

**Polymorphism:**

Polymorphism enables objects of different classes to be treated as if they were of the same class, allowing for dynamic behavior. In ST, this is achieved using base class references.

```st
VAR myObject: MyClass;

PROGRAM_DEFINITION Main
  PROGRAM_DEFINITION MyDerivedClass EXTENDS MyClass
    ...
  END_PROGRAM

  myObject := MyDerivedClass();
  myObject.MyMethod();
END_PROGR
