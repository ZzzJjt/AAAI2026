### Intent:
**Intent Summary:**  
Develop a PLC-based control narrative for ethanol fermentation, specifying setpoints (e.g., 32â€“35Â°C, pH 4.5â€“5.0), instrumentation (temperature/pH sensors, dosing pumps), and interlocks (temperature/pH deviations, failed inoculation) to automate batch fermentation with safety and quality compliance.  

*(Focus: Code generation for fermentation control logic, alarms, and interlocks in ethanol production.)*

### Prompt:
**Control Narrative Beer Brewing:**

Create a control narrative for beer brewing including concrete setpoints and ranges.

Create a detailed explanation of the Lautering process (Section 4). Include the equipment and instrumentation needed. Provide a list of the steps to execute.

**R-T-F:**

ðŸŸ¥ R (Role) â€“ Define Your Role

You are a process automation engineer tasked with writing a structured control narrative for a beer brewing system, with emphasis on process instrumentation and control logic.

ðŸŸ© T (Task) â€“ Define the Objective

Develop a detailed control narrative for the beer brewing process, including:
	â€¢	Concrete setpoints and control ranges for each brewing stage
	â€¢	A comprehensive Section 4 â€“ Lautering, which must include:
	â€¢	Description of required equipment and instrumentation
	â€¢	A step-by-step procedure for lautering
	â€¢	Embedded control logic and interlocks, such as turbidity thresholds and flow control

â¸»

ðŸŸ§ F (Format) â€“ Specify the Output Format

Deliver the control narrative in a structured format consisting of:
	1.	Process Overview
	â€¢	Define key stages: mashing, lautering, boiling, fermentation, etc.
	â€¢	Include numeric control parameters (e.g., mash temperature: 66â€¯Â°C Â± 1â€¯Â°C, sparge water temp: 76â€¯Â°C)
	2.	Section 4 â€“ Lautering
	â€¢	Equipment: Lauter tun, rake motor, flow meters, level sensors, turbidity probe
	â€¢	Instrumentation:
	â€¢	LT-401: Lauter tun level transmitter
	â€¢	FT-402: Wort outlet flow transmitter
	â€¢	TT-403: Sparge water temperature sensor
	â€¢	TU-404: Turbidity meter at wort outlet
	â€¢	Control Sequence:
	1.	Initiate recirculation
	2.	Monitor turbidity until it falls below 200 NTU
	3.	Begin wort transfer to kettle while initiating sparge water at 76â€¯Â°C
	4.	Maintain level in lauter tun (60â€“80%)
	5.	Stop lautering when flow < 0.5 L/min or target volume reached
	3.	Outputs:
	â€¢	Control flags (LauterStart, LauterStop, DivertCloudyWort)
	â€¢	Comments and logic interlocks

### Generated Code:
