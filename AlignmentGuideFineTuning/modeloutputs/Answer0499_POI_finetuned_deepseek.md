### Intent:
**Intent Summary:**  
Create a reusable IEC 61131-3 Structured Text function block to compute the sine of an angle (in radians) efficiently, either using built-in `SIN()` or a Taylor series approximation, with considerations for real-time PLC constraints, precision, and documentation.  

*(Focus: Modular sine computation for industrial automation, balancing accuracy and performance.)*

### Prompt:
**Sine Function**

Develop a self-contained function block in IEC 61131-3 Structured Text to compute the sine of a given angle in radians. Ensure that the function block is modular and reusable, with appropriate comments detailing the mathematical operations involved. Include a discussion on the precision of the sine function within the context of PLC programming and its potential limitations in real-time applications.

**R-I-S-E:**

🟥 R (Role) – Your Role

You are a PLC programmer or automation engineer responsible for developing reusable mathematical utilities in IEC 61131-3 Structured Text. Your objective is to implement a real-time-capable trigonometric function block to compute the sine of a given angle, supporting motion control or waveform modeling tasks in industrial systems.

⸻

🟩 I (Input) – What You’re Given

You need to build a function block that:
	•	Accepts an input:
	•	AngleRad : REAL — the input angle in radians
	•	Returns an output:
	•	SineValue : REAL — the calculated sine of the angle
	•	Should work even in systems that do not support built-in SIN()
	•	Must execute efficiently within a PLC scan cycle and handle rounding/precision issues appropriately

⸻

🟧 S (Steps) – What You Need to Do
	1.	Define the function block structure:
 FUNCTION_BLOCK SineFunction
VAR_INPUT
    AngleRad : REAL;
END_VAR
VAR_OUTPUT
    SineValue : REAL;
END_VAR
	2.	Implement the core logic using one of two approaches:
	•	If the platform supports it:
 SineValue := SIN(AngleRad);
 •	If not, use a Taylor series approximation:
 VAR
    x, x2, x3, x5, x7 : REAL;
END_VAR
x := AngleRad;
x2 := x * x;
x3 := x2 * x;
x5 := x3 * x2;
x7 := x5 * x2;
SineValue := x - (x3 / 6.0) + (x5 / 120.0) - (x7 / 5040.0);
3.	Add inline comments:
	•	State the formula used and assumptions (e.g., radians, approximation terms)
	•	Note that the series works best near 0 and may require input normalization
	•	Warn of performance/accuracy trade-offs in long-running loops or real-time control
	4.	Optional: Normalize large angles to the range [-π, π] to improve accuracy

⸻

🟦 E (Expectation) – What Success Looks Like

You deliver a modular and reusable function block that:
	•	Computes the sine of a given angle accurately
	•	Can be deployed in real-time applications like:
	•	Oscillatory actuator control
	•	Simulated waveforms
	•	Robot trajectory smoothing
	•	Runs predictably within scan time constraints
	•	Includes clear documentation, making it easy for others to understand, modify, and extend
