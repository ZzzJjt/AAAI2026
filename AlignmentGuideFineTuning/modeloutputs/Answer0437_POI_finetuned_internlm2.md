ðŸŸ© I (Input) â€“ What Youâ€™re Given

You need to implement an OPC UA client in C and make it available in a PLC program through a function block written in Structured Text. The function block should expose the following interface:

Inputs:

	â€¢	Execute (BOOL): Starts the OPC UA connection process
	â€¢	ServerUrl (STRING[255]): The OPC UA server address
	â€¢	Timeout (TIME): Maximum duration to wait for a response

Outputs:

	â€¢	Done (BOOL): Set to TRUE when the operation completes successfully
	â€¢	Busy (BOOL): TRUE while the operation is ongoing
	â€¢	Error (BOOL): Set if the connection fails
	â€¢	ErrorID (DWORD): Contains an error code for diagnosis

Additionally, the implementation must include robust error handling, proper session management, and seamless integration between C and the ST environment.

ðŸŸ§ S (Steps) â€“ What You Need to Do

	1.	Write C-code for the OPC UA client using a suitable library (e.g., open62541) to manage server connection, session creation, and error handling.
	2.	Create a C interface (DLL or static library) that exposes functions callable from IEC 61131-3 ST environments.
	3.	Implement an ST function block that calls these C functions, controls the connection lifecycle using Execute and Timeout, and sets the appropriate output flags (Done, Busy, Error, ErrorID).
	4.	Ensure rising-edge detection on Execute, prevent blocking behavior, and handle timeouts and connection errors with meaningful codes.

The resulting solution enables the PLC to initiate OPC UA client sessions in a non-blocking, deterministic manner. It provides reliable communication with OPC UA servers, with clear status reporting and error trackingâ€”making it suitable for use in real-time industrial control environments. The function block should be self-contained, with no external dependencies, and should be easily integrated into existing IEC 61131-3 code.

**C-A-S-E:**

ðŸŸ¥ C (Context) â€“ The Situation

In industrial automation, OPC UA (Open Platform Communications Unified Architecture) is a widely adopted standard for secure, interoperable communication between devices and systems. PLCs often need to interact with OPC UA servers to exchange data or control parameters. However, implementing OPC UA client functionality in a PLC environment can be challenging due to the differences between C and IEC 61131-3 Structured Text.

ðŸŸ© A (Action) â€“ What You Should Do

To address this challenge, you should develop a C-based OPC UA client that can be integrated into a PLC program using IEC 61131-3 Structured Text. The client should handle server connection, session creation, and error handling, while the function block should expose a clear interface for PLC control, with proper input and output pin definitions.

ðŸŸ© S (Solution) â€“ The Answer

To implement the OPC UA client in C, you can use a library like open62541, which provides a robust and efficient implementation of the OPC UA protocol. Write C-code to handle server connection, session creation, and error handling, ensuring that the client can handle timeouts and connection failures gracefully.

Next, create a C interface (either a DLL or a static library) that exposes the necessary functions for the OPC UA client. This interface should be callable from IEC 61131-3 Structured Text environments, allowing the PLC to control the clientâ€™s behavior.

Implement an ST function block that calls the C functions through the interface, managing the connection lifecycle using the Execute and Timeout inputs. Set the appropriate output flags (Done, Busy, Error, ErrorID) to indicate the clientâ€™s status and any errors encountered.

Ensure that the function block handles rising-edge detection on the Execute input, preventing blocking behavior. Implement timeout handling to ensure that the PLC can detect when the client has not received a response within the specified time frame. Finally, provide meaningful error codes in the ErrorID output to aid in diagnosing connection issues.

ðŸŸ© E (Example) â€“ The Output

The resulting function block can be integrated into a PLC program, enabling non-blocking, deterministic communication with OPC UA servers
