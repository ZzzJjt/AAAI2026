### Intent:
**Intent Summary:**  
Create a detailed control narrative for an ammonium nitrate reactor, specifying setpoints, instrumentation, and control logic to ensure safe and efficient operation.  

*(For code generation: Focus on translating reactor parameters like temperature, pressure, flow ratios, and pH into programmable control loops with defined setpoints and interlocks.)*

### Prompt:
**Control Narrative for Ammonium Nitrate Reactor**

Create a control narrative for a reactor producing ammonium nitrates including concrete setpoints and ranges.

**B-A-B:**

ðŸŸ¥ B (Before) â€“ The Problem or Challenge

In the production of ammonium nitrate, the reactor stage is critical for maintaining safety, product quality, and process efficiency. However, without a clearly defined control narrativeâ€”including setpoints, ranges, and instrumentationâ€”operators and control systems risk process instability, inefficient reactions, or unsafe operating conditions. Generic documentation often lacks the precision needed for automation or regulatory compliance.

ðŸŸ© A (After) â€“ The Desired Outcome

Develop a comprehensive control narrative for the ammonium nitrate reactor, including:
	â€¢	Concrete setpoints and control ranges for key parameters such as:
	â€¢	Reaction temperature (e.g., 170â€“180â€¯Â°C)
	â€¢	Reactor pressure (e.g., 4.5â€“5.0â€¯bar)
	â€¢	Ammonia-to-nitric acid ratio
	â€¢	pH control
	â€¢	Identification of critical instrumentation: temperature sensors, pressure transmitters, flow meters, pH analyzers
	â€¢	Description of control logic and interlocks for normal operation and safety shutdowns

â¸»

ðŸŸ§ B (Bridge) â€“ How to Get There
	1.	Define the process overview:
	â€¢	Neutralization of nitric acid with ammonia in a continuous stirred-tank reactor (CSTR)
	2.	List key control loops and their setpoints:
	â€¢	Temperature control loop: TIC-101 setpoint = 175â€¯Â°C Â± 2â€¯Â°C
	â€¢	Pressure control loop: PIC-102 = 4.8â€¯bar Â± 0.2â€¯bar
	â€¢	Flow ratio control: Ammonia:Acid = 1.01:1
	â€¢	pH control loop: target = 6.0â€“6.5
	3.	Add equipment and instrumentation references (e.g., FIC-103 for ammonia feed, LSH-104 for high-level interlock)
	4.	Detail startup and normal operation sequence, followed by shutdown logic triggered by deviations from pressure, temperature, or flow
