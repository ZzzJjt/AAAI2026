### Intent:
**Intent Summary:**  
Develop an ISA-88-compliant IEC 61131-3 Structured Text program to automate sequential batch control (polymerize, decover, dry) for PVC production, including precise phase logic, safety handling, and modular methods like reactor evacuation and temperature maintenance.  

*(Focus: Batch automation, ISA-88 structure, phased control with safety/scalability.)*

### Prompt:
**Batch PVC:**

Develop a self-contained program in IEC 61131-3 Structured Text for the sequential control of a reactor in the batch production of polyvinylchloride (PVC) via polymerization of vinyl chloride monomers. The program should follow an ISA-88 control recipe structure and include the following process stages: polymerize, decover, and dry. Each stage should consist of ordered operations, including preparing the reactor by evacuating it to remove oxygen, charging the reactor with demineralized water and surfactants, and reacting by adding vinyl chloride monomer and catalyst while controlling the temperature between 55-60Â°C until the pressure decreases.

Provide detailed content for key methods such as EvacuateReactor, which should handle the removal of oxygen, and AddDemineralizedWater, ensuring precise process parameters and timers are integrated. Additionally, discuss the application of ISA-88 principles in structuring the control recipe and the challenges involved in scaling the recipe for industrial use.

**T-A-G:**

ðŸŸ¥ T (Task)

Design a batch automation solution for the production of polyvinylchloride (PVC) via polymerization of vinyl chloride monomers, following ISA-88 standards.

ðŸŸ© A (Action)

Develop a self-contained IEC 61131-3 Structured Text program that controls the sequential batch stages:
	â€¢	Polymerize: Evacuate the reactor, charge it with demineralized water and surfactants, and initiate polymerization by adding VCM and catalyst. Maintain temperature between 55â€“60Â°C and monitor pressure drop.
	â€¢	Decover: Prepare the system for material release or transfer.
	â€¢	Dry: Finalize the process by removing residual moisture.

Implement detailed methods such as EvacuateReactor and AddDemineralizedWater, including timing logic, parameter setpoints, and condition-based transitions. Ensure the program structure reflects ISA-88 principles, using modular phases and reusable function blocks.

ðŸŸ¦ G (Goal)

Deliver a robust, scalable, and ISA-88-compliant Structured Text control program that ensures precise sequencing, operational safety, and easy adaptation to industrial-scale PVC production environments.
