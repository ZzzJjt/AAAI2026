**Section 1: Introduction**

This control narrative describes the control strategy for the ethanol production process, with a focus on the fermentation phase. The goal is to ensure process stability and safety by maintaining critical parameters within defined setpoints and ranges.

**Section 2: Process Overview**

The ethanol production process involves several steps, including:
	â€¢	Raw material preparation
	â€¢	Mashing
	â€¢	Fermentation
	â€¢	Distillation
	â€¢	Drying
	â€¢	Packaging

The focus of this control narrative is on the fermentation phase, which involves the conversion of sugars in the mash to ethanol by yeast. The fermentation process is critical to the overall production process, as it determines the final ethanol yield and quality.

**Section 3: Fermentation**

The fermentation process is divided into several subsections, each with its own control objectives and parameters.

**3.1 Inoculation Control**

The inoculation process involves adding yeast to the mash to initiate fermentation. The control objective is to ensure that the yeast is added at the correct time and in the correct amount to achieve the desired fermentation rate and ethanol yield.

The control strategy for inoculation involves:
	â€¢	Monitoring the mash temperature and pH to ensure they are within the optimal range for yeast growth.
	â€¢	Using a programmable logic controller (PLC) to control the addition of yeast based on these parameters.
	â€¢	Monitoring the yeast concentration in the mash using a yeast sensor and adjusting the addition rate accordingly.
	â€¢	Alarms and interlocks are in place to prevent over-inoculation or under-inoculation, which can lead to poor fermentation performance or contamination.

**3.2 Temperature Regulation**

The fermentation process is temperature-sensitive, and maintaining the mash temperature within a specific range is critical to achieving the desired fermentation rate and ethanol yield. The control objective is to maintain the mash temperature within a narrow range of 32â€“35Â°C.

The control strategy for temperature regulation involves:
	â€¢	Using a temperature sensor to measure the mash temperature.
	â€¢	Using a PLC to control the heating and cooling systems based on the temperature sensor readings.
	â€¢	Alarms and interlocks are in place to prevent the mash temperature from exceeding the upper or lower limits, which can lead to poor fermentation performance or contamination.

**3.3 pH Control**

The fermentation process is also pH-sensitive, and maintaining the mash pH within a specific range is critical to
