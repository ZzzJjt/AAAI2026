**Spline Interpolation:**

Spline interpolation is a powerful technique for generating smooth curves that pass through a set of known data points. Unlike linear interpolation, which simply connects the points with straight lines, spline interpolation uses a series of polynomials to create a smooth curve that closely fits the data.

In industrial automation applications, spline interpolation is particularly useful for generating motion trajectories, smoothing signals, and implementing profile-based control. By using spline interpolation, control systems can achieve higher accuracy and precision, resulting in better performance and more reliable operation.

To implement spline interpolation in IEC 61131-3 Structured Text, you can follow these steps:

1. **Create a Function Block:** Start by creating a function block named SplineInterpolator. This block should have two input arrays, X and Y, which contain the known x-values and corresponding y-values, respectively. It should also have a single input, TargetX, which represents the x-value at which to evaluate the interpolated y-value. The output of the function block should be InterpolatedY, which represents the spline-interpolated y-value at TargetX.

2. **Design the Logic:** The logic of the function block should include the following steps:
	* Identify the interval [X[i], X[i+1]] that contains TargetX. This can be done by comparing TargetX to each x-value in the X array and selecting the appropriate interval.
	* Use precomputed cubic spline coefficients (a, b, c, d) for that segment. These coefficients can be computed using a variety of algorithms, such as the de Boisfort method or the Catmull-Rom method.
	* Evaluate the spline using the formula:
y = a + b(x - x_i) + c(x - x_i)^2 + d(x - x_i)^3
where x_i is the x-value at the beginning of the interval.

3. **Comment the Code:** It is important to comment the code thoroughly to explain the algorithm and its implementation. The comments should include:
	* How the spline coefficients are structured. For example, you can store the coefficients in an array or use a data structure to represent the polynomial.
	* How the interval is selected at runtime. This can be done using a simple comparison
