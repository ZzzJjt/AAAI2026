### Intent:
**Intent Summary:**  
Create a non-recursive, scan-cycle-safe quicksort function block in IEC 61131-3 Structured Text to efficiently sort integer arrays in PLC applications using stack-emulated iteration and Lomuto/Hoare partitioning.  

*(Key focus: Industrial-grade sorting without recursion, compliant with PLC constraints.)*

### Prompt:
**Quicksort:**
Implement a self-contained function block in IEC 61131-3 structured text to perform the quicksort algorithm on an array of integers. Ensure efficient partitioning and recursion handling.

**C-A-R-E:**

ðŸŸ¥ C (Context) â€“ Background Situation

Sorting integer arrays efficiently is a common requirement in PLC-based systemsâ€”for example, in alarm prioritization, measurement filtering, or report generation. While quicksort is a widely used and efficient algorithm, its typical implementation relies on recursion, which is not supported in many IEC 61131-3 Structured Text environments. Therefore, implementing quicksort for industrial controllers requires a scan-cycle-safe, non-recursive solution.

ðŸŸ© A (Action) â€“ Task to Perform

Develop a self-contained function block in Structured Text that implements the quicksort algorithm for an array of integers. The function block should:
	â€¢	Sort the array in place using an iterative approach
	â€¢	Replace recursive calls with stack-emulated logic (e.g., using two arrays for lower and upper bounds of subarrays)
	â€¢	Use an efficient partitioning scheme, such as Lomuto or Hoare
	â€¢	Include input signals like Execute : BOOL and output signals like Done : BOOL
	â€¢	Be written in a modular, structured style with inline comments for maintainability

â¸»

ðŸŸ¨ R (Result) â€“ Expected Outcome

The result will be a robust, scan-cycle-safe sorting block that can be reused in any PLC program requiring fast array sorting. It will:
	â€¢	Complete the sorting without recursion
	â€¢	Be efficient even for large arrays (e.g., 100+ elements)
	â€¢	Comply with IEC 61131-3 standards
	â€¢	Be easy to integrate, modify, or extend for future applications

ðŸŸ¦ E (Example) â€“ Concrete Illustration

Example logic for emulating recursion with a loop and index stack:

// Pseudocode structure inside the function block:
WHILE StackPointer > 0 DO
   Low := LowStack[StackPointer];
   High := HighStack[StackPointer];
   StackPointer := StackPointer - 1;

   IF Low < High THEN
      PartitionIndex := Partition(InputArray, Low, High);
      // Push left and right subarrays onto the stack
      StackPointer := StackPointer + 1;
      LowStack[StackPointer] := Low;
      HighStack[StackPointer] := PartitionIndex - 1;

      StackPointer := StackPointer + 1;
      LowStack[StackPointer] := PartitionIndex + 1;
      HighStack[StackPointer] := High;
   END_IF;
END_WHILE;

**Solution:**

```
FUNCTION quicksort(InputArray : ARRAY[1..100] OF INTEGER) : ARRAY[1..100] OF INTEGER;
VAR
   StackPointer : INTEGER;
   Low, High, PartitionIndex : INTEGER;
BEGIN
   // Initialize stack pointers
   StackPointer := 0;

   WHILE StackPointer > 0 DO
      Low := LowStack[StackPointer];
      High := HighStack[StackPointer];
      StackPointer := StackPointer - 1;

      IF Low < High THEN
         PartitionIndex := Partition(InputArray, Low, High);
         // Push left and right subarrays onto the stack
         StackPointer := StackPointer + 1;
         LowStack[StackPointer] := Low;
         HighStack[StackPointer] := PartitionIndex - 1;

         StackPointer := StackPointer + 1;
         LowStack[StackPointer] := PartitionIndex + 1;
         HighStack[StackPointer] := High;
   END_IF;
END_WHILE;

FUNCTION Partition(InputArray : ARRAY[1..100] OF INTEGER; Low : INTEGER; High : INTEGER) : INTEGER;
VAR
   PivotValue : INTEGER;
BEGIN
   // Choose a pivot value (e.g., middle element)
   PivotValue := InputArray[(Low + High) DIV 2];

   // Scan through the array
   WHILE Low < High DO
      IF InputArray[Low] < PivotValue THEN
         IF InputArray[High] >= PivotValue THEN
            HIGH := HIGH - 1;
         ELSE
            Exchange(InputArray, Low, HIGH);
      END_IF;
      LOW := LOW + 1;
   END_WHILE;

   // Place the pivot value in its correct position
   Exchange(InputArray, Low, High);

   // Return the pivot index
   PARTITION := High;
END_FUNCTION;
```

This function block implements a non-recursive quicksort algorithm using a stack-emulated approach and Lomuto or Hoare partitioning schemes. It can be easily integrated into any PLC program requiring efficient array sorting.
