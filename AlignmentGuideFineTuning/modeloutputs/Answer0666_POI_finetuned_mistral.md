### Intent:
**Intent Summary:**  
Create a scan-cycle-safe Kalman filter function block in IEC 61131-3 Structured Text to estimate an autonomous vehicle's position and velocity using configurable noise parameters, ensuring real-time execution on a PLC.  

*(Focus: Real-time state estimation, modular design, and industrial PLC constraints.)*

### Prompt:
**Kalman Filter:**
Implement a self-contained function block in IEC 61131-3 structured text to create a Kalman filter for estimating the position and velocity of an autonomous transport vehicle. Include configurable parameters for noise covariance and initial conditions.

**R-I-S-E:**

ðŸŸ¥ R (Role) â€“ Define Your Role

Act as a control systems engineer developing a Kalman filter function block in IEC 61131-3 Structured Text for real-time state estimation of an autonomous vehicleâ€™s position and velocity on a PLC.

â¸»

ðŸŸ© I (Input) â€“ Information Provided

You are tasked with implementing a discrete-time Kalman filter that:
	â€¢	Estimates position and velocity based on noisy position measurements
	â€¢	Accepts configurable parameters including:
	â€¢	Process noise covariance (Q)
	â€¢	Measurement noise covariance (R)
	â€¢	Sample time (DeltaT)
	â€¢	Initial position and velocity
	â€¢	Must be written in Structured Text without matrix libraries
	â€¢	Should be modular and suitable for scan-cycle-based PLC execution

â¸»

ðŸŸ§ S (Steps) â€“ Steps to Perform
	1.	Define the function block interface with inputs:
	â€¢	MeasuredPosition : REAL
	â€¢	Q, R : REAL (noise covariances)
	â€¢	DeltaT : REAL (sample time)
	â€¢	Reset : BOOL
	2.	Internally store:
	â€¢	Estimated position (x_est_pos) and velocity (x_est_vel)
	â€¢	Previous position (x_est_prev)
	â€¢	Error covariance (p)
	â€¢	Kalman gain (k)
	3.	Implement the prediction step:
	â€¢	Predict new position based on current velocity
	â€¢	Update error covariance with Q
	4.	Implement the correction step:
	â€¢	Compute Kalman gain
	â€¢	Update position with measurement
	â€¢	Estimate velocity based on position change
	â€¢	Update error covariance with R
	5.	Add reset logic and initialize all states on Reset = TRUE
	6.	Ensure the block executes within one scan cycle with safe real-time behavior

ðŸŸ¦ E (Expectation) â€“ Expected Outcome

Deliver a modular, scan-safe Kalman filter function block that provides accurate and noise-tolerant estimates of an autonomous vehicleâ€™s position and velocity. The block should be easily reusable, configurable via Q and R, and ready for integration into industrial motion control systems on PLC hardware.
