### Intent:
**Intent Summary:**  
Develop a C++-based Model Predictive Control (MPC) system to optimize wind farm operations by dynamically adjusting turbine pitch angles and battery storage dispatch, ensuring stable power output under fluctuating wind conditions while outperforming traditional PID control.  

*(Key focus: MPC for real-time wind farm optimization with turbine dynamics, energy storage, and grid stability constraints.)*

### Prompt:
**Model Predictive Control for Wind Farm Optimization Using C++:**

Develop C++ code to implement a model predictive control (MPC) algorithm to optimize the operation of a wind farm. The control system should consider factors such as wind speed variability, turbine dynamics, and power output efficiency. It should also ensure grid stability while accounting for constraints on turbine operation, energy storage, and power dispatch under fluctuating environmental conditions.

Implement C++ code to simulate the wind farm’s operational dynamics and demonstrate the effectiveness of the MPC in managing real-time power generation and distribution.

**C-A-R-E:**

🟥 C（Context）

Wind farms face challenges due to the unpredictable nature of wind speed, the nonlinear dynamics of turbines, and the need to ensure stable power output to the grid. Traditional control methods often fall short in optimizing power generation, managing energy storage, and responding to rapid environmental changes in real time.

🟩 A（Action）

Develop C++ code to implement a model predictive control (MPC) algorithm for optimizing wind farm operations. The control system should account for wind variability, turbine dynamics, and energy efficiency, while handling operational constraints related to energy storage and power dispatch. Simulate the wind farm’s behavior under varying conditions and integrate the MPC for real-time decision-making.

🟨 R（Result）

The MPC system should improve the coordination between turbines and energy storage, increase power output efficiency, and stabilize grid interaction, even under fluctuating environmental conditions—achieving results beyond what conventional controllers can deliver.

🟦 E（Example）

For example, during a sudden drop in wind speed, the MPC anticipates the drop, redistributes turbine loads, and activates energy storage to maintain power delivery, preventing grid instability and minimizing efficiency loss—while a traditional controller may react too late or inefficiently.
