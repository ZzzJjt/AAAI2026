### Intent:
The task is to create a fixed traffic light control system in IEC 61131-3 Structured Text that implements a state machine with timed transitions, pedestrian crossing support, emergency vehicle priority, and safe light sequencing while adhering to PLC programming standards.

### Prompt:
**Programming Reference:**
Compile a comprehensive list of all valid keywords used in the IEC 61131-3 Structured Text programming language, ensuring that it covers both standard control flow structures and data types. Include examples of usage for key functions where applicable.

**B-A-B:**

ðŸŸ¥ Before â€“ The Current Situation

You are working with IEC 61131-3 Structured Text, a standard language used in industrial automation for programmable logic controllers (PLCs). Developers often struggle to find a single, consolidated reference that lists all valid keywords, especially for control flow, data types, and functions, along with practical usage examples.

â¸»

ðŸŸ© After â€“ The Desired Outcome

You will have a comprehensive, well-organized programming reference that includes:
	â€¢	All reserved keywords and standard identifiers in IEC 61131-3 Structured Text
	â€¢	Control structures such as IF, CASE, FOR, WHILE, etc.
	â€¢	Data types including BOOL, INT, REAL, ARRAY, STRUCT, and more
	â€¢	Standard functions and function blocks, like TON, CTU, ABS, SQRT, with example usages
	â€¢	Brief code snippets to demonstrate how the most important constructs are used in practice

â¸»

ðŸŸ¦ Bridge â€“ What You Need to Do

Compile and present a structured reference document that includes:
	1.	A keyword category breakdown:
	â€¢	Control flow (IF, ELSIF, END_IF, CASE, FOR, REPEAT, etc.)
	â€¢	Data types (BOOL, INT, REAL, TIME, STRING, etc.)
	â€¢	Operators (AND, OR, MOD, NOT, etc.)
	â€¢	System constants (TRUE, FALSE, MAX, MIN, etc.)
	2.	A section on standard functions and function blocks with:
	â€¢	Brief descriptions
	â€¢	IEC 61131-3-compliant usage examples
	â€¢	Notes on any vendor-specific behavior, if applicable
	3.	A downloadable or easily searchable format, such as:
	â€¢	A table or checklist format for fast lookup
	â€¢	Highlighted example blocks like:

 VAR
  x: INT := 5;
  y: INT := 10;
  result: BOOL;
END_VAR

IF x < y THEN
  result := TRUE;
END_IF;

### Generated Code:
The task is to create a fixed traffic light control system in IEC 61131-3 Structured Text that implements a state machine with timed transitions, pedestrian crossing support, emergency vehicle priority, and safe light sequencing while adhering to PLC programming standards.
