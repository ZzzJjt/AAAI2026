### Intent:
**Intent Summary:**  
Develop an IEC 61131-3 Structured Text program to sequentially control an EtherCAT slave deviceâ€™s state transitions (INIT â†’ PREOP â†’ SAFEOP â†’ OP) with 5-second delays, error checking, and symbolic state names for compliance and reliability.  

*(Key focus: Sequential state transitions, timing, error handling, and readability.)*

### Prompt:
**EtherCAT State Machine Control Using IEC 61131-3 Structured Text:**

Develop an IEC 61131-3 structured text (ST) program to sequentially transition through all the states of an EtherCAT slave device using the ESM (EtherCAT State Machine) function block. The program should use descriptive state names (such as INIT, PREOP, SAFEOP, OP, etc.) rather than numerical values, ensuring that state transitions occur only when allowed. A 5-second timer delay should be implemented before each state transition to ensure proper timing and stabilization. Discuss the implementation of the EtherCAT state machine, including logic for handling state transitions, error checking, and ensuring compliance with EtherCAT protocol requirements.

**C-A-R-E:**

ðŸŸ¥ C (Context) â€“ The Background

In EtherCAT networks, slave devices follow a strict sequence of operational statesâ€”INIT, PREOP, SAFEOP, and OPâ€”that must be respected for reliable communication and system safety. Improper transitions or timing can cause initialization failures, data loss, or non-compliance with the EtherCAT standard.

ðŸŸ© A (Action) â€“ The Implementation Task

Develop an IEC 61131-3 Structured Text (ST) program that controls the EtherCAT State Machine (ESM) for a slave device. The program should transition sequentially through the INIT â†’ PREOP â†’ SAFEOP â†’ OP states using descriptive symbolic names rather than numeric codes. A 5-second delay should be implemented between each state transition to allow stabilization. The logic must verify that each transition is valid before proceeding and include error-checking to handle failures gracefully.

ðŸŸ¨ R (Result) â€“ The Expected Outcome

The program should ensure compliant, reliable transitions across all EtherCAT states, improving network stability and diagnostic clarity. Using symbolic state names enhances readability and maintainability, while built-in delay and error-handling mechanisms ensure safe and predictable device initialization.

ðŸŸ¦ E (Example) â€“ A Practical Use Case

For example, after power-up, the device starts in the INIT state. The program waits 5 seconds, checks that the slave is ready, and transitions to PREOP. After another 5 seconds and verification, it moves to SAFEOP, and finally to OP. If any transition fails (e.g., due to a configuration error), the program logs the error and halts further progression, allowing operators to investigate and correct the issue.

If any transition fails (e.g., due to a configuration error), the program logs the error and halts further progression, allowing operators to investigate and correct the issue.

**Implementation:**

1. Define the EtherCAT slave device's states as variables with descriptive names (e.g., `state_INIT`, `state_PREOP`, `state_SAFEOP`, `state_OP`).

2. Create a 5-second timer using the `T#` timer function (e.g., `T_5s`).

3. Implement a `transition_allowed` function that checks if the current state is valid for transitioning to the next state.

4. In the main program loop, check the current state and the `transition_allowed` function. If the transition is allowed, wait for the `T_5s` timer to expire, then transition to the next state.

5. Implement error-checking logic to handle failures during state transitions, such as communication errors or configuration issues. Log the error and halt further progression if necessary.

6. Ensure that the program complies with EtherCAT protocol requirements, such as proper state transitions and timing.

**Example Code:**

```
PROGRAM EtherCAT_State_Machine
VAR
    state_INIT, state_PREOP, state_SAFEOP, state_OP : BOOL;
    T_5s : TON;
    transition_allowed : BOOL;
    error_occurred : BOOL;
END_VAR

state_INIT := TRUE;

LOOP
    IF state_INIT THEN
        transition_allowed := Check_Transition_Allowed(state_INIT, state_PREOP);
        IF transition_allowed AND NOT T_5s.Q THEN
            state_PREOP := TRUE;
            T_5s := T#5s;
        END_IF;
    END_IF;

    IF state_PREOP THEN
        transition_allowed := Check_Transition_Allowed(state_PREOP, state_SAFEOP);
        IF transition_allowed AND NOT T_5s.Q THEN
            state_SAFEOP := TRUE;
            T_5s := T#5s;
        END_IF;
    END_IF;

    IF state_SAFEOP THEN
        transition_allowed := Check_Transition_Allowed(state_SAFEOP,
