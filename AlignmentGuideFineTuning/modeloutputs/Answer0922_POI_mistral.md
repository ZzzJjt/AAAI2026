ðŸŸ© A (Action) â€“ How It Works
	1.	Inputs:
	â€¢	SP (Setpoint): The desired target value of the process (e.g., 75Â°C).
	â€¢	PV (Process Variable): The actual measured value (e.g., current temperature).
	â€¢	Kp, Ki, Kd: Tuning constants that define proportional, integral, and derivative behavior.
	â€¢	Optional: MANUAL mode for overriding automatic control, and LIMIT_HI / LIMIT_LO for output clamping.
	2.	Processing:
	â€¢	Computes Error := SP - PV.
	â€¢	Calculates:
	â€¢	Proportional Term: Kp * error
	â€¢	Integral Term: Ki * âˆ« error dt (to remove steady-state offset)
	â€¢	Derivative Term: Kd * d(error)/dt (to dampen sudden changes)
	â€¢	Combines these to form the control signal (OUT), with output limiting and anti-windup protection.
	3.	Outputs:
	â€¢	OUT: The control signal to the actuator (e.g., valve position, motor speed).
	â€¢	ERROR: Real-time deviation between SP and PV.
	â€¢	Status flags: Such as saturation indicators (if limits are reached).

**Tuning Parameters:**

ðŸŸ¥ T (Task) â€“ What You Need to Do

Understand the role of the tuning parameters (Kp, Ki, Kd) in the PID function block and how to adjust them for optimal performance in various industrial applications.

ðŸŸ© A (Action) â€“ How It Works

	1.	Kp (Proportional Gain): Controls the response speed and stability of the system. A higher Kp value increases the response speed but may cause overshoot or instability.
	2.	Ki (Integral Gain): Reduces steady-state error and improves stability by integrating the error over time. A higher Ki value reduces steady-state error but may cause overshoot or instability.
	3.	Kd (Derivative Gain): Reduces overshoot and improves stability by considering the rate of change of the error. A higher Kd value reduces overshoot but may cause instability or noise amplification.

ðŸŸ¦ G (Goal) â€“ What You Achieve

By adjusting the tuning parameters, you can optimize the PID controller for specific process requirements, such as minimizing overshoot, reducing steady-state error, or improving response time.

**Implementation Examples:**
