### Intent:
**Intent Summary:**  
Develop an IEC 61131-3 Structured Text function block for a Modbus TCP server that handles 10 parallel client connections, supports standard Modbus function codes (e.g., Read Coils, Write Registers), and ensures robust communication with error handling.  

*(Focus: Parallel client support, Modbus compliance, and industrial reliability.)*

### Prompt:
**Modbus Server for Parallel Client Connections using 61131-3 Structured Text:**

Develop a self-contained 61131-3 structured text function block to implement a Modbus server capable of handling up to 10 parallel client connection requests over Modbus TCP. The server should manage Modbus requests within data ranges that map input and holding registers. The following Modbus function codes must be supported:

	â€¢	0x01: Read Coils
	â€¢	0x02: Read Discrete Inputs
	â€¢	0x03: Read Holding Registers
	â€¢	0x04: Read Input Registers
	â€¢	0x05: Write Single Coil
	â€¢	0x06: Write Single Register
	â€¢	0x0F: Write Multiple Coils
	â€¢	0x10: Write Multiple Registers
	â€¢	0x17: Read/Write Multiple Registers

In addition, describe the ReadCoils method, explaining how it processes client requests, maps coil data, and manages communication over TCP/IP.

**T-A-G:**

ðŸŸ¥ T (Task) â€“ What You Need to Do

Develop an IEC 61131-3 Structured Text (ST) function block that acts as a Modbus TCP server capable of managing up to 10 parallel client connections and supporting multiple standard Modbus function codes.

â¸»

ðŸŸ© A (Action) â€“ How to Do It

Design the function block to handle Modbus TCP communication, parse incoming requests, and execute operations based on the following supported function codes:

	â€¢	0x01: Read Coils
	â€¢	0x02: Read Discrete Inputs
	â€¢	0x03: Read Holding Registers
	â€¢	0x04: Read Input Registers
	â€¢	0x05: Write Single Coil
	â€¢	0x06: Write Single Register
	â€¢	0x0F: Write Multiple Coils
	â€¢	0x10: Write Multiple Registers
	â€¢	0x17: Read/Write Multiple Registers

Ensure that each of the 10 clients is handled independently. Implement detailed internal logic for each function code, especially ReadCoils, which should:

	â€¢	Interpret the clientâ€™s coil address request
	â€¢	Extract the appropriate bits from a coil data buffer
	â€¢	Format the data into a valid Modbus TCP response
	â€¢	Communicate the result back to the client
 
Also, include error handling for unsupported requests and connection timeouts.

ðŸŸ¦ G (Goal) â€“ What You Want to Achieve

Create a reliable, standards-compliant Modbus TCP server function block that can serve multiple clients simultaneously, support industrial communication demands, and provide accurate and fast responses to various Modbus requestsâ€”improving system scalability, robustness, and integration flexibility.

ðŸŸ§ R (Reasoning) â€“ Why It Matters

Modbus is a widely used industrial communication protocol that enables devices to exchange data over a network. By developing a Modbus TCP server function block, you can create a versatile and reliable communication interface for your system. This function block will allow you to handle multiple clients concurrently, ensuring that your system can efficiently process requests and provide accurate responses. Additionally, supporting a wide range of Modbus function codes will enable your system to interact with various devices and applications that use Modbus.

ðŸŸ¨ E (Example) â€“ How It Works in Practice

To develop the Modbus TCP server function block, follow these steps:

1. **Define the Function Block:** Create a new function block in your IEC 61131-3 ST environment and define the necessary input and output variables. These should include coil and register data buffers, as well as connection and error handling variables.

2. **Implement the Server Logic:** Develop the main logic of the function block to handle incoming client requests. This should include parsing the Modbus request, determining the function code, and executing the appropriate operation.

3. **Handle ReadCoils Function Code:** Implement the ReadCoils function code logic, which should interpret the clientâ€™s coil address request, extract the appropriate bits from the coil data buffer, format the data into a valid Modbus TCP response, and communicate the result back to the client.

4. **Implement Error Handling:** Include error handling for unsupported requests and connection timeouts. This will ensure that the server can gracefully handle errors and maintain communication with clients.

5. **Test and Validate:** Test the function block with various Modbus requests and ensure that it provides accurate and fast responses. Validate the function block against Modbus standards and industry best practices.

By following these steps, you will create a robust and reliable Modbus TCP server function block that can handle multiple clients concurrently and support a wide range of Modbus function codes. This will enhance the scalability, robustness, and integration flexibility of your system, making it more versatile and capable of interacting with various devices and applications that use Modbus.
