### Intent:
**Intent Summary:**  
Develop an IEC 61131-3 Structured Text program to automatically close a vessel's inlet valve when the liquid level exceeds a high setpoint, maintain the interlock until the level drops below a reset threshold, and enforce fail-safe actions for sensor/valve faults to prevent overfilling.

### Prompt:
**Interlock Overfill Protection:**

Develop a self-contained IEC 61131-3 Structured Text program to implement an interlock system for overfill protection of a vessel. The program should utilize a level sensor to monitor the liquid level in the vessel and control an inlet valve to prevent overfilling.

The logic should ensure that the inlet valve automatically closes when the level sensor detects that the liquid has reached a predefined high-level setpoint. The interlock should remain engaged until the level drops below a safe threshold. Additionally, include a fail-safe mechanism to handle sensor failure or valve malfunction, ensuring the system defaults to a safe state. Discuss the importance of interlocks in industrial process safety and the role of overfill protection in preventing hazardous conditions.

**B-A-B:**

ðŸŸ¥ B (Before) â€“ The Challenge

In many industrial processes, uncontrolled vessel overfilling can lead to dangerous spills, environmental damage, equipment failure, or even fire and explosion hazards. Without an automatic protection mechanism, operators may not react in time to high-level conditions or instrumentation faults. Manual intervention alone is not always reliable, especially in unattended or fast-filling operations.

ðŸŸ© A (After) â€“ The Ideal Outcome

Develop a self-contained IEC 61131-3 Structured Text program that performs automatic overfill protection for a process vessel. The system should:
	â€¢	Continuously monitor the liquid level using a level sensor.
	â€¢	Automatically close the inlet valve (e.g., INLET_VALVE := FALSE) when the level reaches a predefined high-level setpoint.
	â€¢	Keep the valve closed until the level drops below a safe lower reset threshold, avoiding valve chattering.
	â€¢	Include a fail-safe mechanism that:
	â€¢	Closes the inlet valve if the level sensor fails (e.g., stuck signal or sensor offline).
	â€¢	Defaults to a safe state in the event of valve malfunction.

This logic ensures that the system proactively responds to overfill risks and maintains safe operation without requiring manual input under fault conditions.

â¸»

ðŸŸ§ B (Bridge) â€“ The Implementation Strategy

To build this interlock system:
	1.	Define input variables for the level signal, fault detection, and valve status.
	2.	Use conditional logic to monitor for high-level conditions:

 IF LevelSensor > HIGH_SETPOINT THEN
    INLET_VALVE := FALSE;
    SHUTDOWN_LATCH := TRUE;
END_IF;

IF SHUTDOWN_LATCH AND LevelSensor < RESET_THRESHOLD THEN
    SHUTDOWN_LATCH := FALSE;
END_IF;

IF SensorFault OR ValveFault THEN
    INLET_VALVE := FALSE; // Fail-safe action
END_IF;

	3.	Implement latching logic to maintain interlock status until reset conditions are met.
	4.	Include manual override protections only with supervisory control and alarm acknowledgment.

Finally, explain how overfill interlocks are critical to process safety, asset protection, and regulatory compliance, particularly in chemical, pharmaceutical, and oil & gas industries.

ðŸŸ¥ C (Context) â€“ The Background Situation

In industrial processes, overfilling a vessel can lead to serious safety incidents, including spills, environmental damage, and equipment failure. Without automated protection, operators may not respond quickly enough to high-level conditions, especially in fast-flowing or unattended systems.

ðŸŸ© A (Action) â€“ The Task to Perform

Develop a self-contained IEC 61131-3 Structured Text program to implement overfill protection for a vessel. The program should monitor the liquid level using a level sensor and automatically close the inlet valve when the level exceeds a high setpoint. The interlock should remain engaged until the level drops below a safe threshold. Additionally, include a fail-safe mechanism to handle sensor or valve faults, ensuring the system defaults to a safe state.

ðŸŸ§ R (Result) â€“ The Desired Outcome

The program should:
	â€¢	Actively monitor the liquid level and immediately trigger the inlet valve closure upon detecting overfill.
	â€¢	Prevent the valve from repeatedly opening and closing by maintaining the interlock until the level is safe.
	â€¢	Provide a fail-safe mechanism that defaults to closing the inlet valve if the level sensor or valve fails, ensuring the system remains in a safe state.

â¸»

ðŸŸ¦ E (Explanation) â€“ The Why and How

Interlocks are essential for industrial safety, preventing hazardous conditions such as overfilling, underfilling, or equipment damage. In overfill protection, the level sensor plays a critical role in triggering the interlock. The Structured Text program should ensure that the interlock is engaged only when the level is high and remains engaged until the level is safe. The fail-safe mechanism is vital for handling sensor or valve faults, ensuring the system defaults to a safe state and preventing any hazardous conditions.

In summary, the program should:
	â€¢	Actively monitor the liquid level using a level sensor.
	â€¢	Automatically close the inlet valve when the level exceeds a high setpoint.
	â€¢	Prevent the valve from repeatedly opening and closing by maintaining the interlock until the level is safe.
	â€¢	Provide a fail-safe mechanism that defaults to closing the inlet valve if the level sensor or valve fails, ensuring the system defaults to a safe state.
