In oil refinery operations, distillation columns are critical for separating mixtures into their component parts. However, traditional control methods often fall short in handling the nonlinear dynamics and complex interactions within these systems, especially when considering operational constraints such as temperature limits, flow rates, and energy efficiency.

Develop a MATLAB-based model predictive control (MPC) system for a distillation column. The model should capture the relationship between feed rates and temperature, allowing for precise control of the distillation process. Avoid plotting results to maintain a focus on numerical outputs and control logic.

Use the developed model to implement an MPC algorithm that optimizes the distillation process while respecting operational constraints. Ensure that the control scheme is designed to handle the nonlinear dynamics of the system and provide robust performance under varying operating conditions.

For instance, in a distillation column, the feed rate and temperature are key variables that must be managed to ensure optimal separation. Without a detailed model, itâ€™s difficult to predict how changes in one variable will affect the others. Using MATLAB, engineers can simulate the columnâ€™s dynamics and implement an MPC algorithm that adjusts the feed rate and temperature in real time, ensuring that the column operates efficiently and safely under varying conditions.
