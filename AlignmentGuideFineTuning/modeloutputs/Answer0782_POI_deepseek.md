### Intent:
"Create a reusable IEC 61131-3 structured text function block for a configurable digital counter with up/down modes, initial value/step settings, limit protection, and status outputs for PLC automation systems."

### Prompt:
**Counter:**
Implement a self-contained function block in IEC 61131-3 structured text for a digital counter with up/down counting modes. Include configurable initial value, step size, and overflow handling.

**R-T-F:**

🟥 R (Role) – Define Your Role

Act as a PLC developer creating a flexible, reusable digital counter function block in IEC 61131-3 Structured Text for automation applications.

⸻

🟩 T (Task) – Define the Objective

Implement a self-contained counter function block that supports both up and down counting modes with the following features:
	•	A configurable initial value and step size
	•	Inputs for count direction, enable, and reset
	•	Protection against overflow and underflow, using configurable MaxValue and MinValue limits
	•	Output of the current count value and status flags indicating if limits are reached

The counter should operate reliably in scan-cycle-driven environments and support integration into larger automation programs.

⸻

🟧 F (Format) – Specify the Output Format

Provide:
	•	A complete IEC 61131-3 Structured Text function block
	•	Declarations for all inputs, outputs, and internal variables
	•	Logic using IF/ELSIF structures to increment/decrement the counter
	•	Overflow and underflow handling using comparison conditions
	•	A Reset condition to reinitialize the counter
	•	Inline comments explaining the purpose of each block of code
