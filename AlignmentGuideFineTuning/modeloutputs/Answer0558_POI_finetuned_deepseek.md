### Intent:
**Intent Summary:**  
Develop a cascade control system with an outer pressure loop and inner flow loop to regulate vessel pressure by adjusting oil flow rate via a proportional valve, ensuring stable operation within defined limits.

### Prompt:
**PID Temperature Control Gas Turbine:**

Develop a self-contained IEC 61131-3 Structured Text program to implement PID feedback control for regulating the temperature inside a gas turbine. The control program should manage the opening of an inlet valve based on a temperature setpoint, ensuring that the PID controller adjusts the valve position to maintain optimal turbine performance.

The program should include the necessary PID parameters (proportional, integral, and derivative gains) and logic to handle deviations from the temperature setpoint. Also, incorporate limits on the valve opening to ensure safe operation. Discuss the challenges of temperature regulation in gas turbines, focusing on system dynamics, response time, and maintaining stability under varying load conditions.

**R-I-S-E:**


You are a PLC control engineer tasked with developing a PID-based temperature control strategy for a gas turbine system. Your solution must ensure fast and stable control of turbine inlet temperature under variable load conditions.

ðŸŸ© I (Input) â€“ What Youâ€™re Given
	â€¢	Temp_PV: The real-time measured temperature inside the gas turbine
	â€¢	Temp_SP: The temperature setpoint (e.g., 950Â°C)
	â€¢	PID gains:
	â€¢	Proportional: Kp := 3.0
	â€¢	Integral: Ki := 0.7
	â€¢	Derivative: Kd := 0.2
	â€¢	Valve_Position: The output signal that controls the inlet valve (% open)
	â€¢	Valve limits: Minimum = 0.0%, Maximum = 100.0%
	â€¢	Cycle time: 100 ms sampling period

â¸»

ðŸŸ§ S (Steps) â€“ What You Need to Do
	1.	Calculate the error between the setpoint and measured temperature:
Error := Temp_SP - Temp_PV
	2.	Accumulate the integral term based on the error and cycle time:
Integral := Integral + Error * 0.1
	3.	Calculate the derivative using the difference between the current and previous error:
Derivative := (Error - Prev_Error) / 0.1
	4.	Compute the PID output to determine valve position:
Valve_Position := (Kp * Error) + (Ki * Integral) + (Kd * Derivative)
	5.	Clamp the valve output to stay within the defined operational limits
	6.	Store the current error in Prev_Error for the next cycle

â¸»

ðŸŸ¦ E (Expectation) â€“ What Success Looks Like

The PID program should:
	â€¢	Maintain the turbine temperature precisely at the target setpoint
	â€¢	Respond quickly to load changes, fuel variability, and thermal disturbances
	â€¢	Prevent overheating or undershooting by clamping valve actuation
	â€¢	Be deployable on industrial PLCs and suitable for high-reliability control environments in energy systems
