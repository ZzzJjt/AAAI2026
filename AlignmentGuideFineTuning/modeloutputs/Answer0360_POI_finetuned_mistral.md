### Intent:
**Intent Summary:**  
Develop a Python-based non-linear model-predictive controller (NMPC) to optimize steam generator startup in power plants by dynamically adjusting fuel and steam flows while respecting temperature, pressure, and safety constraints.

### Prompt:
**Startup Steam Generator:**

Develop a non-linear model-predictive controller (NMPC) in Python to optimize the startup process of a steam generator in a power plant. The NMPC should be designed to handle the non-linear dynamics of the steam generation process, considering key variables such as pressure, temperature, and flow rates. The controller must minimize startup time while maintaining safety and operational constraints.

Ensure that the Python implementation is modular, with clear explanations of the optimization algorithm, control horizon, and prediction model. Discuss the benefits of using NMPC for steam generator startup, particularly in terms of energy efficiency and system stability, and highlight the challenges associated with controlling such a complex non-linear process.

**C-A-R-E:**

ðŸŸ¥ C (Context) â€“ Background Situation

Steam generators in power plants must be started up with precise control over temperature, pressure, and flow rates, all of which exhibit non-linear dynamics during the startup process. Traditional PID or linear MPC approaches may fall short when dealing with the complexity, variability, and tight operational constraints of thermal systems. To address this, non-linear model-predictive control (NMPC) provides a more accurate and efficient solution for optimizing startup procedures while ensuring safety.

ðŸŸ© A (Action) â€“ Task to Perform

Develop a non-linear model-predictive controller (NMPC) in Python to optimize the startup process of a steam generator. The controller must:
	â€¢	Accurately model non-linear system behavior (e.g., heat transfer, steam flow)
	â€¢	Predict system states across a defined control horizon
	â€¢	Adjust control inputs dynamically to minimize startup time
	â€¢	Respect safety and operational constraints on key variables like temperature, pressure, and flow
	â€¢	Be implemented in a modular Python structure, with components for modeling, prediction, and optimization

Also, explain the components of the NMPC design (prediction model, constraints, objective function), and ensure the code includes clear comments and documentation.

â¸»

ðŸŸ¨ R (Result) â€“ Expected Outcome

The outcome will be a Python-based NMPC controller that achieves a faster and safer startup of the steam generator. The NMPC will enable real-time constraint handling, reduce energy waste, and enhance operational reliability by reacting intelligently to non-linear process dynamics. The design will also support modular reuse in other thermal control systems.

ðŸŸ¦ E (Example) â€“ Concrete Illustration

For example:
	â€¢	The prediction model might use a system of ODEs representing pressure build-up and temperature rise.
	â€¢	The control loop will solve a constrained optimization problem every few seconds using libraries like CasADi or GEKKO.
	â€¢	Sample constraint in Python:

  opti.subject_to(T_steam <= 520)  # Upper limit on steam temperature
  opti.subject_to(P_boiler >= 30)  # Minimum pressure requirement
