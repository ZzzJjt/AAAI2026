ðŸŸ© A (Action) â€“ How It Works
	1.	Inputs:
	â€¢	SP (Setpoint): The desired target value of the process (e.g., 75Â°C).
	â€¢	PV (Process Variable): The actual measured value (e.g., current temperature).
	â€¢	Kp, Ki, Kd: Tuning constants that define proportional, integral, and derivative behavior.
	â€¢	Optional: MANUAL mode for overriding automatic control, and LIMIT_HI / LIMIT_LO for output clamping.
	2.	Processing:
	â€¢	Computes Error := SP - PV.
	â€¢	Calculates:
	â€¢	Proportional Term: Kp * error
	â€¢	Integral Term: Ki * âˆ« error dt (to remove steady-state offset)
	â€¢	Derivative Term: Kd * d(error)/dt (to dampen sudden changes)
	â€¢	Combines these to form the control signal (OUT), with output limiting and anti-windup protection.
	3.	Outputs:
	â€¢	OUT: The control signal to the actuator (e.g., valve position, motor speed).
	â€¢	ERROR: Real-time deviation between SP and PV.
	â€¢	Status flags: Such as saturation indicators (if limits are reached).

ðŸŸ¦ G (Goal) â€“ What You Achieve

By using the OSCAT PID function block, you can:
	â€¢	Maintain stable and accurate control over critical process parameters like pressure, temperature, or flow.
	â€¢	Optimize process performance through real-time corrections.

ðŸŸ© I (Example) â€“ A Real-World Example

Consider a chemical plant that uses a urea synthesis process. The process involves controlling the valve operations, monitoring the reactor pressure and temperature, and managing the reaction timing. The plant uses a PID function block to control the process.

1.	SP (Setpoint): The desired urea concentration in the reactor.
2.	PV (Process Variable): The actual urea concentration in the reactor.
3.	Kp, Ki, Kd: Tuning constants that define the proportional, integral, and derivative behavior.
4.	MANUAL mode: Allows manual override of the automatic control.
5.	LIMIT_HI / LIMIT_LO: Clamp the output to prevent over- or under-control.

By using the PID function block, the plant can maintain stable and accurate control over the urea concentration, optimize the process performance, and reduce manual tuning.
