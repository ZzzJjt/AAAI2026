### Intent:
**Intent Summary:**  
Develop an IEC 61131-3 Structured Text program to implement PID feedback control for maintaining a distillation column's liquid level by dynamically adjusting an inlet valve position within safe limits, ensuring process stability and efficiency.  

*(Focus: PID control, level regulation, valve constraints, real-time PLC operation.)*

### Prompt:
**PID Level Control Distillation Column:**

Develop a self-contained IEC 61131-3 Structured Text program to implement PID feedback control for maintaining the liquid level in a distillation column. The control system should adjust the opening of an inlet valve that feeds liquid into the column based on the level setpoint.

The program should incorporate the PID parameters (proportional, integral, and derivative gains) and handle scenarios where the liquid level deviates from the setpoint. Ensure that the logic includes limits on the inlet valve position to prevent overfeeding or underfeeding the column. Discuss the importance of level control in maintaining the efficiency and stability of the distillation process, focusing on response time and control precision under varying operating conditions.

**T-A-G:**

🟥 T (Task) – What You Need to Do

Write a self-contained IEC 61131-3 Structured Text program (not a function block) to implement PID feedback control for maintaining the liquid level in a distillation column. The program should dynamically adjust the inlet valve position based on the difference between the actual and desired level.

⸻

🟩 A (Action) – How to Do It
	1.	Measure the current liquid level (Level_PV) and compare it to a predefined setpoint (Level_SP := 60.0).
	2.	Calculate the control error, accumulate the integral, and compute the derivative using a 100 ms sample time.
	3.	Use tuned PID parameters (Kp := 1.5, Ki := 0.4, Kd := 0.2) to compute the output signal Valve_Position.
	4.	Clamp the valve position between a minimum and maximum value (Valve_Min := 0.0, Valve_Max := 100.0) to avoid overfeeding or underfeeding.
	5.	Update the error state (Prev_Error) for the next scan cycle.

⸻

🟦 G (Goal) – What You Want to Achieve

The program should:
	•	Maintain the liquid level at the setpoint despite disturbances in feed or reflux flow
	•	Provide stable and responsive valve control for effective level regulation
	•	Prevent process issues such as column flooding or tray drying
	•	Be suitable for real-time PLC operation and easy integration into distillation process control systems
