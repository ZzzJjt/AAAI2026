### Intent:
The intent is to convert a Structured Text (ST) program for a Pick and Place automation system into an equivalent Instruction List (IL) representation while preserving all logic, timing, and mode-switching functionality for PLC execution.

### Prompt:
**Translate ST To Instruction List:**

Translate the following 61131-3 Structured Text program to 61131-3 Instruction List: PROGRAM PickAndPlace VAR ManualButton : BOOL; // Input signal for manual mode AutoButton : BOOL; // Input signal for auto mode ClipButton : BOOL; // Input signal for clip action TransferButton : BOOL; // Input signal for transfer action ReleaseButton : BOOL; // Input signal for release action ConveyorA : BOOL; // Input signal for presence of product on conveyor A ConveyorB : BOOL; // Output signal to control conveyor B RoboticArm : BOOL; // Output signal to control the robotic arm Mode : INT := 0; // Internal variable to store the current mode (0 = manual, 1 = auto) AutoProcess : BOOL := FALSE; // Internal variable to store whether the auto control process is currently running END_VAR

// Manual mode control process IF ManualButton THEN Mode := 0; // Set mode to manual END_IF

IF Mode = 0 THEN // Manual mode IF ClipButton AND ConveyorA THEN RoboticArm := TRUE; // Clip the product ELSIF TransferButton THEN ConveyorB := TRUE; // Transfer the product to conveyor B ELSIF ReleaseButton THEN ConveyorB := FALSE; // Release the product from conveyor B END_IF END_IF

// Auto mode control process IF AutoButton THEN Mode := 1; // Set mode to auto END_IF

IF Mode = 1 THEN // Auto mode IF NOT AutoProcess AND ConveyorA THEN // Only start the process if not currently running and there is a product on conveyor A AutoProcess := TRUE; // Set flag to indicate that the auto process is running RoboticArm := TRUE; // Clip the product WAIT 2; // Wait for 2 seconds to transfer the product ConveyorB := TRUE; // Transfer the product to conveyor B END_IF IF ConveyorB AND NOT ConveyorA THEN // Release the product from conveyor B once it has been transferred and there is no product on conveyor A ConveyorB := FALSE; AutoProcess := FALSE; // Clear the flag to indicate that the auto process is not running END_IF END_IF

**T-A-G:**

ðŸŸ¥ T (Task)

Translate a Structured Text (ST) program written in IEC 61131-3 into its equivalent Instruction List (IL) representation.

ðŸŸ© A (Action)

Take the provided PickAndPlace ST program, which includes variable declarations, mode selection, conditional logic for manual and automatic control, and a process delay (WAIT). Convert the logic into Instruction List using IL syntax such as LD, ST, AND, JMPC, JMP, and labels. Accurately simulate timing behavior and preserve all logical conditions, ensuring operational equivalence between the two formats.

ðŸŸ¦ G (Goal)

Deliver a complete and syntactically correct IL version of the program that maintains the same functional behavior as the original ST codeâ€”ready to be used on IL-compatible PLCs for industrial automation tasks.

ðŸŸ¥ R (Role) â€“ Your Role

You are a PLC programmer or automation engineer responsible for converting control logic from Structured Text (ST) to Instruction List (IL) for deployment on a PLC that only supports IL. Your goal is to ensure that the logic remains functionally equivalent between the two representations.

ðŸŸ© I (Input) â€“ What Youâ€™re Given

You are provided with a 61131-3 Structured Text program (PickAndPlace) that controls a pick-and-place robotic system with manual/auto modes, clip/transfer/release actions, and conveyor control. The program includes logic for both modes, with timing delays and mode switching.

ðŸŸ§ S (Steps) â€“ How to Do It

	1.	Identify the key logic and control flow in the ST program, including mode detection, input handling, and timed operations.
	2.	Translate the logic into Instruction List (IL) using the appropriate keywords and syntax (e.g., LD, ST, AND, JMPC, JMP, etc.).
	3.	Replace the structured control flow with equivalent IL constructs, ensuring that the timing and mode-switching logic is accurately preserved.
	4.	Replace the structured loops and conditions with equivalent IL logic, maintaining the original intent and functionality.
	5.	Replace the structured data types and variable usage with their IL equivalents, ensuring that the logic operates on the correct data types and ranges.
	6.	Replace the structured function blocks and methods with equivalent IL logic, preserving the control flow and functionality.
	7.	Replace the structured timer and delay logic with equivalent IL constructs, ensuring that the timing behavior is accurately maintained.
	8.	Replace the structured input and output handling with equivalent IL logic, ensuring that the control signals are processed and relayed accurately.
	9.	Replace the structured mode detection and state management with equivalent IL logic, ensuring that the mode transitions and state tracking are accurately maintained.
	10.	Replace the structured error handling and fault detection with equivalent IL logic, ensuring that the fault conditions and error responses are accurately processed.

ðŸŸ© E (Example) â€“ What It Should Look Like

	â€¢	Replace the following ST code:
	â€¢	ClipButton := ReadButtonInput(ButtonClip);

	â€¢	Replace it with:
	ClipButton := ReadButtonInput(ButtonClip);

	â€¢	Replace the following ST code:
	â€¢	ClipButton := ReadButtonInput(ButtonClip);

	â€¢	Replace it with
