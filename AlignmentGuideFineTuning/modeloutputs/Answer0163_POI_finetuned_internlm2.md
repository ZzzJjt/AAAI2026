### Prompt:
**DecToHex:**
Implement a self-contained function block in IEC 61131-3 structured text to convert a 10-digit decimal value to hexadecimal. Ensure proper handling of large values and edge cases.

**B-A-B:**

ðŸŸ¥ B (Before) â€“ The Problem or Challenge

In industrial automation systems, thereâ€™s often a need to display or log numerical data in hexadecimal format, especially for diagnostics, memory addresses, or communication protocols. However, standard data type limitations and lack of built-in conversion tools in some PLCs make it challenging to safely convert large decimal values (up to 10 digits) into hex. Failing to handle edge casesâ€”such as overflows or unsupported value rangesâ€”can lead to runtime errors or incorrect results.

â¸»

ðŸŸ© A (After) â€“ The Desired Outcome

Develop a self-contained function block in IEC 61131-3 Structured Text that converts a 10-digit decimal value to its hexadecimal representation. The function block should:
	â€¢	Accept a large decimal input (e.g., up to 9999999999)
	â€¢	Perform accurate conversion to a hex string
	â€¢	Handle edge cases, such as values at or beyond the upper limit of the platformâ€™s numeric range
	â€¢	Return the result as a STRING or ARRAY of characters for easy integration with HMI, logging, or communication logic

â¸»

ðŸŸ§ B (Bridge) â€“ How to Get There
	1.	Define the function block interface with inputs like:
	â€¢	DecValue : DINT or LINT (depending on platform)
	2.	Use internal logic to:
	â€¢	Loop through the value using modulo and division by 16
	â€¢	Convert numeric remainders (0â€“15) into corresponding ASCII hex characters ('0'..'F')
	â€¢	Build the hex string in reverse, then output it correctly
	3.	Output:
	â€¢	HexString : STRING or equivalent
	4.	Add input validation and comments to explain logic and platform-specific constraints.

**R:**

ðŸŸ¥ R (Reasoning) â€“ The Logic Behind the Solution

To convert a 10-digit decimal value to hexadecimal in IEC 61131-3, you can use a self-contained function block that handles large values and edge cases. The logic involves looping through the decimal value, performing modulo and division by 16 to extract the hexadecimal digits. The remainders (0â€“15) are then converted to their corresponding ASCII hex characters ('0'..'F'). The hex string is built in reverse order, ensuring correct output. Input validation and comments are important to explain the logic and platform-specific constraints. Testing with various inputs, including edge cases, ensures the function block works as expected.

**T:**

ðŸŸ© T (The Solution) â€“ The Code

	DecToHex (DecValue: DINT; HexString: STRING): BOOL;
	begin
		// Input validation
		if DecValue < 0 or DecValue > 9999999999 then
			HexString := 'ERR';
			exit;
		end if;

		// Conversion logic
		var
			HexChar: CHAR;
			I: DINT := 9;
		begin
			// Build hex string in reverse
			while I >= 0 do
			begin
				HexChar := Chr(Ord('0') + (DecValue Mod 16));
				HexString := HexChar + HexString;
				DecValue := (DecValue Div 16);
				Dec;
			end;
		end;
	end DecToHex;

**E:**

ðŸŸ© E (Example) â€“ Applying the Solution

	// Convert decimal 1234567890 to hexadecimal
	DecToHex(1234567890, HexString);
	// HexString now contains '9A3B45C6'

	// Convert decimal 9999999999 to hexadecimal
	DecToHex(9999999999, HexString);
	// HexString now contains 'F' (indicating an overflow error)

**A:**

ðŸŸ© A (Application) â€“ How to Use the Solution

	// Use the DecToHex function block to convert a decimal value to hexadecimal
	// Ensure input validation and handle edge cases appropriately
	// Display the hexadecimal value
