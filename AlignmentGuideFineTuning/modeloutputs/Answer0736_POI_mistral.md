ðŸŸ© T (Task) â€“ What You Need to Do

Develop a function block named MeanStdDevCalculator that:
	â€¢	Accepts an input array:
InputArray : ARRAY[1..100] OF INT
	â€¢	Computes two statistical outputs:
	â€¢	Mean : REAL â€“ the average of the 100 values
	â€¢	StdDev : REAL â€“ the sample standard deviation
	â€¢	Follows this logic:
	1.	Mean:
	â€¢	Sum all elements using a REAL accumulator
	â€¢	Divide by 100.0
	2.	Standard deviation:
	â€¢	For each value, subtract the mean and square the result
	â€¢	Sum these squared differences
	â€¢	Divide by 99.0 and apply SQRT
	â€¢	Includes inline comments to explain:
	â€¢	The use of REAL for accuracy and to prevent overflow
	â€¢	Why the divisor is Nâˆ’1 for sample standard deviation
	â€¢	How the design ensures deterministic scan-time performance
	â€¢	Addresses limitations such as:
	â€¢	Precision loss with large integers
	â€¢	Potential scan-time impact if extended to larger arrays
	â€¢	Inflexibility if array size must change (optionally parameterize in future)

ðŸŸ§ F (Format) â€“ Expected Output

Your final function block should include:

Mean := Sum / 100.0;

SumSquaredDiff := 0.0;

    Diff := InputArray[i] - Mean;
    SumSquaredDiff := SumSquaredDiff + (Diff * Diff);
END_FOR;
StdDev := SQRT(SumSquaredDiff / 99.0);

	â€¢	Inline documentation that clearly describes the purpose of each section
	â€¢	A structure that supports reuse in:
	â€¢	Sensor signal conditioning
	â€¢	Real-time quality assurance
	â€¢	Anomaly detection in control loops

ðŸŸ¦ C (Context) â€“ Important Details

The function block should be designed for real-time control systems, ensuring deterministic performance and minimal impact on scan-time. The input array consists of 100 integers, and the function block computes both the mean and standard deviation.

The use of REAL data types is essential to prevent overflow and ensure precision. However, this may lead to potential precision loss with large integers. The divisor Nâˆ’1 is used for the standard deviation calculation to account for the sample nature of the data.

The function block should be designed to handle large datasets efficiently, but be aware that extending it to larger arrays may impact scan-time performance. Additionally, the current implementation is inflexible if the array size needs to change, which could be addressed by parameterizing the array size in future versions.

The function block should be applicable in various industrial applications, such as sensor signal conditioning, real-time quality assurance, anomaly detection in control loops, and optimization for real-time performance.
