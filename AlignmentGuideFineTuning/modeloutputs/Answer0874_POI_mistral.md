**Example Scenario:**

A chemical plant wants to optimize the production of three different products (A, B, C) using a limited set of raw materials (X, Y, Z). The production process requires a certain amount of each raw material for each product, and there are constraints on the total amount of each raw material that can be used. The objective is to maximize the total profit from selling the products.

The SimplexSolver function block can be used to solve this problem by providing the objective function coefficients, constraint matrix, and right-hand side values as inputs. The function block will then return the optimal production quantities for each product, the total profit, and a status flag indicating whether the solution is feasible or if the optimization process timed out.

**Limitations:**

Implementing linear programming in a PLC environment has several limitations:

1.	Memory constraints: The size of the constraint matrix and objective function coefficients will be limited by the available memory in the PLC. This may require fixing the matrix sizes or using sparse matrix representations to save memory.
2.	Processing power: The Simplex algorithm requires multiple iterations and row operations, which can be computationally intensive. This may lead to long execution times, especially for large problems.
3.	Floating-point accuracy: PLCs typically use fixed-point or floating-point arithmetic with limited precision. This can lead to rounding errors and potential inaccuracies in the optimization results.
4.	Real-time requirements: PLCs are designed to execute control logic in real-time, with strict timing constraints. The SimplexSolver function block must be optimized to minimize execution time while still providing accurate results.

**Design Choices:**

To address these limitations, the SimplexSolver function block can be designed with the following considerations:

1.	Fixed matrix sizes: To ensure memory safety and minimize the risk of buffer overflows, the function block can be designed to handle matrices of a fixed size. This may limit the size of problems that can be solved, but it simplifies the implementation and reduces the risk of memory-related issues.
2.	Efficient data structures: Using efficient data structures, such as sp
