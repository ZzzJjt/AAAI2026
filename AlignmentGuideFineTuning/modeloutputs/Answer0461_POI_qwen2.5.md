### Intent:
**Intent Summary:**  
Design an interlock system for a chemical reactor that maps hazardous conditions (e.g., overpressure, high temperature) to automated safety actions (e.g., valve closure, reboiler shutdown) via a cause-action matrix, ensuring fail-safe operation.

### Prompt:
**Extended Cause & Process Action Matrix:**

Develop an extended cause and process action matrix for the interlocks in a chemical reactor. Each row should represent a specific cause (e.g., sensor values exceeding limits), and the column headings should represent safety actions performed using actuators in the system. The matrix should illustrate how different causes trigger specific actions to ensure safe operation.

Discuss how this extended matrix provides a clear mapping between potential hazardous situations and the corresponding safety actions. Emphasize the importance of designing interlocks that ensure safe and stable reactor operation, preventing risks such as overpressure, underheating, and process failures.

**Explanation:**

This matrix outlines the interlock system's response to various hazardous conditions in a chemical reactor. Each row represents a specific cause or fault condition, and each column represents a process action that can be taken to mitigate the risk. The 'X' in the cells indicates that the corresponding action is triggered by the cause.

**Fail-Safe Design:**

The design ensures that each critical cause has at least one response, and responses are coordinated to prevent conflict or escalation. For example, if overpressure is detected, the system will first attempt to close the feed valve to reduce the load on the reactor. If this fails, it will activate emergency cooling to lower the temperature. If both these actions fail, the reboiler will be stopped to prevent further heating. Finally, if all else fails, the reactor will be shut down to prevent any potential catastrophic failure.

**Integration of Error Detection Logic:**

The matrix also includes error detection logic. For instance, if a sensor fault is detected, the system will trigger all available actions to ensure the reactor is brought to a safe state. This includes closing the feed valve, activating emergency cooling, stopping the reboiler, and shutting down the reactor.

**Fail-Safe Behavior:**

The fail-safe behavior is designed to ensure that
