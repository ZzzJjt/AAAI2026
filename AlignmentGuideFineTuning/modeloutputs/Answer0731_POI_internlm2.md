ðŸŸ¨ T (Tips) â€“ How to Approach

Here are some tips to help you approach this task:

â€¢	Consider the computational complexity of the chosen algorithm. For example, the Power Method has a linear complexity, making it suitable for PLCs with limited processing power.
â€¢	Ensure the function block is modular and can be easily reused in other control systems.
â€¢	Test the function block with different input matrices to verify its correctness and efficiency.
â€¢	Consider the potential impact of numerical instability on the results. For example, the Power Method can be sensitive to the initial vector, so you might want to include a normalization step to ensure the initial vector has a norm of 1.
â€¢	Implement safeguards to handle non-convergence or timeout scenarios. For example, you could set a maximum number of iterations or a convergence threshold and return an error if these conditions are not met.
â€¢	Consider the impact of the algorithm on real-time performance. For example, the Power Method can be slow to converge, so you might want to include a fallback mechanism that uses a simpler algorithm (e.g., QR decomposition) if the convergence is not satisfactory within a certain time frame.
