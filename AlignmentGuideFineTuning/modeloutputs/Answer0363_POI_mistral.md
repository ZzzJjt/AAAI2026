### Intent:
**Intent Summary:**  
Create a reusable IEC 61131-3 Structured Text function block to accurately convert 10-digit decimal values (LINT) to hexadecimal strings, handling edge cases (zero, overflow) and using iterative division/modulo for scan-safe operation in industrial automation systems.

### Prompt:
**DecToHex:**
Implement a self-contained function block in IEC 61131-3 structured text to convert a 10-digit decimal value to hexadecimal. Ensure proper handling of large values and edge cases.

**C-A-R-E:**

ðŸŸ¥ C (Context) â€“ Background Situation

In industrial automation, converting decimal values to hexadecimal is essential for diagnostics, communication protocols, and memory addressing. However, IEC 61131-3 Structured Text does not always offer built-in methods to handle large decimal numbers (up to 10 digits) and edge cases such as zero or type overflow. A dedicated, reusable function block is needed to safely perform this conversion in scan-cycle-sensitive environments.

ðŸŸ© A (Action) â€“ Task to Perform

Develop a self-contained function block in IEC 61131-3 Structured Text that:
	â€¢	Accepts a 10-digit decimal input (LINT type recommended)
	â€¢	Converts the value to a hexadecimal string output
	â€¢	Includes proper handling of edge cases, such as zero values and upper-limit overflow
	â€¢	Uses a loop to divide the decimal by 16, maps the remainder to its corresponding hex digit (0â€“F), and assembles the hex string in reverse order
	â€¢	Optionally trims leading zeros and provides a minimal-length result

â¸»

ðŸŸ¨ R (Result) â€“ Expected Outcome

The result should be a modular and scan-safe function block that can be integrated into any PLC program requiring decimal-to-hex conversion. It should ensure accuracy, support a wide input range, and be easy to reuse, maintain, and document, making it ideal for use in logging, HMI displays, and communication routines.

ðŸŸ¦ E (Example) â€“ Concrete Illustration

Hereâ€™s a conceptual snippet of the core logic:

WHILE DecValue > 0 DO
   Remainder := DecValue MOD 16;
   HexDigit := DigitMap[Remainder]; // e.g., DigitMap[10] = 'A'
   HexString := CONCAT(HexDigit, HexString); // prepend digit
   DecValue := DecValue / 16;
END_WHILE;

IF HexString = '' THEN
   HexString := '0'; // handle zero input
END_IF;

IF HexString = '' THEN
   HexString := '0'; // handle zero input

The function block should be named "DecToHex" and have input and output variables defined as follows:

INPUT:
	â€¢	DecValue (LINT) â€“ 10-digit decimal input

OUTPUT:
	â€¢	HexString (STRING) â€“ 2-digit hexadecimal output (minimum length)

ðŸŸ¦ T (Test) â€“ Verification Steps

1.	Create a test program with a counter that increments from 0 to 9999999999 and feeds the value to the "DecToHex" function block.
2.	Check that the output of the function block matches the expected hexadecimal values for each input.
3.	Test edge cases, such as zero, negative numbers, and overflow values, to ensure proper handling and error-free operation.
4.	Verify that the function block is scan-safe and does not consume excessive resources or cause unintended side effects in the PLC program.
5.	Document the function block, including its purpose, input/output variables, and any limitations or assumptions.
6.	Share the function block with colleagues or the wider automation community for feedback and potential improvements.
