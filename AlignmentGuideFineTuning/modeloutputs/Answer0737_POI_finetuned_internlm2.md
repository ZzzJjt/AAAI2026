ðŸŸ© T (Task) â€“ What You Need to Do

Create a self-contained function block named NaturalLog that:
	â€¢	Computes the natural logarithm (ln) of a given input X
	â€¢	Uses built-in LN() where available, or prepares to support an approximation method
	â€¢	Accepts:
	â€¢	X : REAL â€“ the input value
	â€¢	Returns:
	â€¢	LnX : REAL â€“ the result of ln(X)
	â€¢	Error : BOOL â€“ set to TRUE if X <= 0 (invalid input)

You should also:
	â€¢	Add clear inline comments explaining:
	â€¢	The mathematical basis of ln(x)
	â€¢	Why inputs must be strictly positive
	â€¢	What happens when the input is out of domain
	â€¢	Ensure the logic is efficient and deterministic, suitable for execution in a PLC scan cycle

ðŸŸ¥ T (Time) â€“ When to Do This

Complete the function block and documentation within 30 minutes, ensuring that the code is self-contained and easy to understand. Focus on clarity and precision, and consider the practical implications of the natural logarithm in industrial control systems.

**E-I-E:**

ðŸŸ¥ E (Example)

Here is an example of how the NaturalLog function block could be used in a real-time control loop:

	// Control loop for a temperature sensor with a linearized response
	// The natural logarithm is used to scale the sensor output to a more linear range
	// (e.g., 0-100Â°C instead of 0-1000Â°C)

	// Input: Sensor output (0-1000Â°C)
	// Output: Control signal (0-100Â°C)

	// Use the NaturalLog function block to scale the sensor output
	// (assuming the sensor has a nonlinear response)
	// The natural logarithm is used to linearize the response
	// and map the sensor output to a more manageable range

	// Control loop:
	IF NaturalLog.SensorOutput > 0.0 THEN
		ControlSignal := NaturalLog.SensorOutput * 10.0; // Scale to 0-100Â°C
	ELSE
		ControlSignal := 0.0; // Invalid input
	END_IF;

	// The natural logarithm is used to scale the sensor output
	// and ensure that the control signal remains within a manageable range
	// This allows for more precise control of the temperature process
	// and reduces the need for complex nonlinear compensation algorithms

	â€¢	Input: SensorOutput (REAL) â€“ The raw output of a temperature sensor (0-1000Â°C)
