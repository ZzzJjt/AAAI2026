### Intent:
**Intent Summary:**  
Create an IEC 61131-3 structured text function block to perform precise floating-point comparisons (REAL types) up to a user-defined decimal precision, including error handling and output flags for equality, greater-than, and less-than conditions.

### Prompt:
**Binary Search:**
Implement a self-contained function block in IEC 61131-3 structured text to perform a binary search on an array of 100 integers. Include input validation and efficient handling of search boundaries.

**B-A-B:**

ðŸŸ¥ B (Before) â€“ The Problem or Challenge

Searching through large arrays in PLC-based systems can be inefficient if done linearly, especially in time-sensitive applications like sorting, classification, or threshold detection. Without a structured and optimized approach like binary search, search operations on a 100-element integer array could result in unnecessary CPU cycles, poor performance, and missed response deadlines in industrial control systems.

â¸»

ðŸŸ© A (After) â€“ The Desired Outcome

Develop a self-contained function block in IEC 61131-3 Structured Text that performs a binary search on a 100-integer array. The function should:
	â€¢	Efficiently locate a target value using binary search logic
	â€¢	Include input validation (e.g., bounds check, sorted array assumption)
	â€¢	Handle search boundaries accurately to avoid indexing errors or infinite loops
	â€¢	Be modular and reusable in PLC programs where fast data lookup is essential

â¸»

ðŸŸ§ B (Bridge) â€“ How to Get There
	1.	Define the function block interface with inputs for:
	â€¢	SearchArray : ARRAY[1..100] OF INT
	â€¢	TargetValue : INT
	â€¢	Enable : BOOL
	2.	Implement binary search logic using WHILE or REPEAT loops and variables like Low, High, and Mid.
	3.	Add validation to ensure the array index boundaries are respected and the search halts when Low > High or the value is found.
	4.	Include outputs such as:
	â€¢	Found : BOOL
	â€¢	Index : INT (position in array if found, else -1)
	5.	Comment each section for clarity and maintainability.

Here is a **complete IEC 61131-3 Structured Text function block** that performs a **precise floating-point comparison** up to a specified number of decimal places. The function block takes two REAL inputs, a user-defined decimal precision, and returns Boolean flags for equality, greater than, and less than. It also includes error handling for invalid inputs and edge cases.

# ðŸ§± FUNCTION_BLOCK: FloatCompare

## âœ… Purpose

Perform a precise floating-point comparison between two REAL values, up to a specified number of decimal places.

---

## ðŸ“‹ Interface Definition

```pascal
FUNCTION_BLOCK FloatCompare
VAR_INPUT
    Value1 : REAL; // First floating-point value
    Value2 : REAL; // Second floating-point value
    Precision : INT := 2; // Number of decimal places to compare
END_VAR

VAR_OUTPUT
    Equal : BOOL; // TRUE if values are equal up to Precision
    Greater : BOOL; // TRUE if Value1 > Value2
    Less : BOOL; // TRUE if Value1 < Value2
    Error : BOOL; // TRUE if inputs are invalid or comparison fails
END_VAR
```

---

## ðŸ§± Implementation Logic

```pascal
// Initialize outputs
Equal := FALSE;
Greater := FALSE;
Less := FALSE;
Error := FALSE;

// Input validation
IF Precision < 0 OR NOT IS_VALID_REAL(Value1) OR NOT IS_VALID_REAL(Value2) THEN
    Error := TRUE;
    Equal := FALSE;
    Greater := FALSE;
    Less := FALSE;
    RETURN;
END_IF;

// Normalize inputs to a common scale
// Multiply by 10^Precision to convert to integers
Value1 := Value1 * POWER(10, Precision);
Value2 := Value2 * POWER(10, Precision);

// Perform comparison
IF Value1 = Value2 THEN
    Equal := TRUE;
    Greater := FALSE;
    Less := FALSE;
ELSIF Value1 >
