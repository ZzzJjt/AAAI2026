### Intent:
**Intent Summary:**  
Develop an IEC 61131-3 Structured Text program to automate the safe and synchronized startup of a Valmet paper machineâ€™s press section, including parameter control (speed, nip pressure, temperature), interlocks, and phased transitions to prevent equipment damage and ensure product quality.

### Prompt:
**Startup Paper Machine:**

ðŸŸ¥ R (Role) â€“ Automation Engineer

As an automation engineer, I am responsible for developing a self-contained IEC 61131-3 Structured Text program to control the startup sequence of a Valmet paper machine's press section. The program must ensure safe and synchronized activation of the press rolls and conveyors, with proper control of nip pressure, temperature, and speed ramp-up.

â¸»

ðŸŸ© E (Environment) â€“ Startup Sequence

The press section of a Valmet paper machine requires a precise startup sequence to prevent damage to the paper sheet and equipment. The startup sequence should include the following phases:

1.	**System Readiness:** Verify that all mechanical and electrical components are ready for operation, including conveyor belts, press rolls, and temperature control systems.

2.	**Conveyor and Roll Pre-Rotation:** Start the conveyor belts and press rolls at a low speed to ensure proper alignment and synchronization.

3.	**Temperature Preheating:** Gradually increase the temperature of the press rolls to the desired range (e.g., 85â€“90Â°C) to ensure even heat distribution and prevent damage to the paper sheet.

4.	**Nip Pressure Ramp-Up:** Increase the nip pressure between the press rolls to the target value (e.g., 250 kN/m) while monitoring the temperature and pressure sensors to ensure safe and controlled ramping.

5.	**Speed Synchronization and Ramp-Up:** Once the temperature and pressure are stable, synchronize the conveyor and roll speeds to gradually ramp up to the operational speed (e.g., 500 m/min) while maintaining optimal nip pressure and temperature.
