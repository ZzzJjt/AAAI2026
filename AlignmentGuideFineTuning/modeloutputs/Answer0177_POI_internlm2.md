### Intent:
**Intent Summary:**  
Create a reusable, configurable PID controller function block in IEC 61131-3 Structured Text with tunable gains, anti-windup, output clamping, and error handling for precise industrial process control (e.g., temperature, pressure) on PLCs.  

*(Key features: modularity, safety, diagnostics, and scan-cycle compatibility.)*

### Prompt:
**PID Controller:**
Implement a self-contained function block in IEC 61131-3 structured text to create a PID controller. Include configurable parameters for proportional, integral, and derivative gains, with error handling and tuning capability.


**B-A-B:**

ðŸŸ¥ B (Before) â€“ The Problem or Challenge

In industrial automation systems, maintaining precise control over temperature, pressure, flow, or position is critical. Without a reliable and tunable PID controller, systems may experience instability, overshoot, or slow response. Many basic PID implementations lack configurable gains, anti-windup measures, or proper error handling, making them unsuitable for complex or sensitive processes when deployed on a PLC using IEC 61131-3 Structured Text.

ðŸŸ© A (After) â€“ The Desired Outcome

Develop a self-contained function block in IEC 61131-3 Structured Text that implements a standard PID controller. The block should:
	â€¢	Include tunable parameters for proportional (Kp), integral (Ki), and derivative (Kd) gains
	â€¢	Support error calculation and handle input setpoint and process variable
	â€¢	Include safeguards such as integral windup prevention, output clamping, and reset logic
	â€¢	Be modular, scan-cycle-safe, and easily integrable into control loops
	â€¢	Provide intuitive input/output structure with documentation for users and maintainers

ðŸŸ§ B (Bridge) â€“ How to Get There
	1.	Define inputs for:
	â€¢	Setpoint : REAL
	â€¢	ProcessVariable : REAL
	â€¢	Kp, Ki, Kd : REAL
	â€¢	Enable, Reset : BOOL
	â€¢	MinOutput, MaxOutput : REAL
	2.	Calculate:
	â€¢	Error = Setpoint â€“ ProcessVariable
	â€¢	Integral term with anti-windup (limit or back-calculate)
	â€¢	Derivative term using difference in process variable
	3.	Output:
	â€¢	ControlOutput : REAL
	â€¢	Optionally, Error, IntegralTerm, and DerivativeTerm for monitoring
	4.	Add structured comments and logic separation (e.g., IF Enable THEN ...)

**Example Usage:**

```ST
// PID Controller Function Block
PIDController : PIDController(
    Setpoint := 25.0,
    ProcessVariable := 23.0,
    Kp := 0.5,
    Ki := 0.1,
    Kd := 0.01,
    Enable := TRUE,
    Reset := FALSE,
    MinOutput := 0.0,
    MaxOutput := 100.0
);

// Control Output
ControlOutput := PIDController.ControlOutput;
```

**Additional Considerations:**

1.	**Safety**: Ensure the PID controller does not cause instability or overshoot, especially in safety-critical systems. Implement safeguards such as anti-windup, output clamping, and reset logic to prevent undesired behavior.
2.	**Modularity**: Design the PID controller as a self-contained function block to promote code reusability and maintainability. Separate logic into distinct sections (e.g., error calculation, anti-windup, output clamping) for better readability and maintainability.
3.	**Scan-Cycle Compatibility**: Ensure the PID controller is compatible with the scan cycle of the PLC, meaning it can be called at regular intervals without causing issues or data corruption.
4.	**Error Handling**: Implement proper error handling for input setpoint, process variable, and other parameters. Handle potential errors such as NaN, Infinity, or out-of-range values gracefully.
5.	**Documentation**: Provide clear and concise documentation for users and maintainers, including input/output structure, parameter descriptions, and behavior under different conditions.
6.	**User Feedback**: Encourage users to provide feedback on the PID controller's performance and behavior. Use this feedback to improve the block's functionality, usability, and documentation.
7.	**Additional Features**: Consider adding additional features or optimizations based on
