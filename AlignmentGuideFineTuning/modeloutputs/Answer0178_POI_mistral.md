### Intent:
**Intent Summary:**  
Create an IEC 61131-3 structured text function block to perform iterative quicksort on integer arrays in PLCs, avoiding recursion while ensuring scan-cycle safety, memory efficiency, and modularity for industrial automation sorting tasks.  

*(Focus: Recursion-free quicksort for PLCs with stack emulation, partitioning, and in-place sorting.)*

### Prompt:
**Quicksort:**
Implement a self-contained function block in IEC 61131-3 structured text to perform the quicksort algorithm on an array of integers. Ensure efficient partitioning and recursion handling.

**B-A-B:**

ðŸŸ¥ B (Before) â€“ The Problem or Challenge

In industrial automation tasks such as data sorting, ranking, or prioritizing process values, efficient sorting algorithms are essential. Quicksort is a powerful algorithm known for its average-case efficiency, but it typically relies on recursion, which is either not supported or discouraged in IEC 61131-3 Structured Text environments due to scan-cycle safety and memory limitations. Without a properly adapted approach, implementing quicksort on a PLC could result in stack overflows or unreadable code structures.

ðŸŸ© A (After) â€“ The Desired Outcome

Develop a self-contained function block in IEC 61131-3 Structured Text that performs the quicksort algorithm on an array of integers. The solution must:
	â€¢	Avoid direct recursion by simulating it with iterative control structures and stack emulation using arrays or state machines
	â€¢	Implement an efficient partitioning mechanism
	â€¢	Sort the array in place, preserving memory efficiency
	â€¢	Be modular, reusable, and compliant with scan-cycle-safe programming practices

â¸»

ðŸŸ§ B (Bridge) â€“ How to Get There
	1.	Define inputs for the function block such as:
	â€¢	InputArray : ARRAY[1..N] OF INT
	â€¢	Execute : BOOL
	2.	Create internal variables to manage sorting state:
	â€¢	Stack emulation using index arrays for Low and High
	â€¢	Pivot, i, j, and temporary variables for swaps
	3.	Use a loop-based simulation of recursive quicksort, pushing and popping subranges to/from an internal stack
	4.	Include an InProgress flag and a Done output to manage multi-scan execution if needed
	5.	Comment clearly on each phase: partitioning, swapping, and range management

	â€¢	InputArray : ARRAY[1..N] OF INT
	â€¢	Execute : BOOL

	5.	Comment clearly on each phase: partitioning, swapping, and range management
	6.	Test the function block with various input arrays and edge cases to ensure correctness and performance

**Implementation:**

1. Define inputs and outputs:
```
PROGRAM Quicksort
VAR
	InputArray : ARRAY[1..N] OF INT;
	Execute : BOOL;
	InProgress : BOOL;
	Done : BOOL;
	StackLow : ARRAY[1..MAX_STACK_DEPTH] OF INT;
	StackHigh : ARRAY[1..MAX_STACK_DEPTH] OF INT;
	StackIndex : INT;
	Pivot, i, j, temp : INT;
END_VAR
```

2. Implement the main loop:
```
IF Execute THEN
	IF InProgress THEN
		-- Continue sorting the current subrange
		IF StackIndex > 0 THEN
			-- Pop the next subrange from the stack
			i := StackLow[StackIndex];
			j := StackHigh[StackIndex];
			StackIndex := StackIndex - 1;
		ELSE
			-- No more subranges on the stack, sorting is done
			InProgress := FALSE;
			Done := TRUE;
		END_IF;
	ELSE
		-- Initialize the first subrange for sorting
		i := 1;
		j := N;

		-- Partition the array and push the subrange to the stack
		Partition(i, j, Pivot);
		StackLow[StackIndex + 1] := i;
		StackHigh[StackIndex + 1] := j;
		StackIndex := StackIndex + 1;

		-- Start sorting the current subrange
		InProgress := TRUE;
	END_IF;
END_IF;
```

3. Implement the partitioning function:
```
FUNCTION Partition : BOOL
VAR_INPUT
	i, j : INT;
	Pivot : INT;
END_VAR_INPUT
VAR_OUTPUT
	Done : BOOL;
END_VAR_OUTPUT
VAR
	temp : INT;
	i_
