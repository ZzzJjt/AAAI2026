### Intent:
The task involves creating an ASCII-based Function Block Diagram (FBD) for a basic control loop with an analog input feeding a timer and PID block, where only the PID output drives an analog output, including labeled signals for clarity in text-based documentation.  

*(For the penicillin fermentation PFD, the intent is:)*  
**"Document a 10,000L penicillin fermentation batch process using text-based PFD notation, detailing equipment, instrumentation, control loops (PID for flow/level/temp/pH/DO), safety interlocks, and alarms for PLC implementation."**

### Prompt:
**FBD PID:**

Create a 61131-3 function block diagram in ASCII art. It shall contain an analog input, a timer block, and a PID block as well as an analog output. The analog input feeds both the timer and the PID block. Only the PID block is connected to the analog output. Provide typical input and output signals for each function block and show them inside each block.

**R-I-S-E:**

🟥 R (Role) – Define Your Role

Act as a PLC programmer or automation engineer tasked with documenting a basic control loop using IEC 61131-3 Function Block Diagram (FBD) concepts in ASCII format for system documentation or collaboration in text-based environments.

🟩 I (Input) – Information Provided

You need to create an ASCII art diagram representing a simple control structure that includes:
	•	An Analog Input block
	•	A TON (Timer On Delay) block
	•	A PID control block
	•	An Analog Output block

The logic flow should follow these rules:
	•	The Analog Input feeds both the Timer and the PID block
	•	Only the PID output (CV) is connected to the Analog Output input (IN)
	•	Each block must show typical signal names, like IN, OUT, ET, PV, SP, CV

⸻

🟧 S (Steps) – Steps to Perform
	1.	Create ASCII block shapes (e.g., using +-----+) to represent each function block.
	2.	Place signal names inside each block:
	•	For AnalogInput: OUT = AI
	•	For TON: IN = AI, ET = ET, Q = Q
	•	For PID: PV = AI, SP = 50.0, CV = CV
	•	For AnalogOutput: IN = CV
	3.	Connect the blocks using arrows (-->) to show signal flow:
	•	AI → TON and PID
	•	CV → Analog Output
	4.	Keep the layout clean, aligned, and readable for quick understanding in plain-text tools.

⸻

🟦 E (Expectation) – Expected Outcome

The result should be a functional, clearly labeled ASCII-based FBD diagram that can be used in technical documentation, version-controlled code repositories, or design review notes. It allows stakeholders to understand the signal flow, block behavior, and interface structure even without graphical tools.

🟨 S (Safety) – Safety Considerations

While creating the FBD, consider the following safety aspects:
	•	Ensure that the PID control loop is properly configured to prevent overshoot and oscillations.
	•	Consider adding interlocks or safety features to the control loop, such as a high-level alarm or a manual override switch.
	•	Ensure that the Analog Input and Analog Output are properly isolated and protected against electrical hazards.

🟩 I (Implementation) – Implementation Details

The FBD diagram should be created using ASCII characters, such as +, -, |, and spaces, to represent the function block shapes and signal connections. The diagram should be easy to read and understand, even in plain-text environments. Here's an example of how the blocks might look:
