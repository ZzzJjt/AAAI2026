**Modeling the Aircraft Dynamics:**

To model the aircraft dynamics, we will use a simplified 6-DOF model, which includes translational and rotational motion in the x, y, z axes, as well as roll, pitch, and yaw.

The state-space representation of the aircraft dynamics can be written as:

```matlab
A = ...; % State transition matrix
B = ...; % Control input matrix
C = ...; % Output measurement matrix
D = ...; % Direct feed-through matrix
```

**MPC Framework:**

The MPC algorithm will consist of the following steps:

1. Prediction: Use the aircraft dynamics model to predict the future states and outputs based on the current state and control inputs.

```matlab
N = ...; % Prediction horizon
x_pred = ...; % Predicted states
y_pred = ...; % Predicted outputs
```

2. Cost Function: Define a cost function that includes objectives for fuel efficiency, safety, and robustness against disturbances.

```matlab
Q = ...; % State weighting matrix
R = ...; % Control input weighting matrix
Q_d = ...; % Disturbance weighting matrix
```

3. Optimization: Solve the optimization problem to find the optimal control inputs that minimize the cost function.

```matlab
u_opt = ...; % Optimal control inputs
```

4. Control Update: Apply the first control input from the optimal sequence to the aircraft.

```matlab
u = u_opt(1);
```

5. Repeat: Repeat the prediction, cost function calculation, optimization, and control update steps at each time step.

**Simulation:**

To test the MPC controller, simulate a realistic flight scenario with varying wind conditions and other disturbances.

```matlab
t_sim = ...; % Simulation time
x0 = ...; % Initial state
u0 = ...; % Initial control input
w = ...; % Wind disturbance

for i = 1:length(t_sim)
    % Predict and optimize
    % ...

    % Update control input
    u = u_opt(1);
