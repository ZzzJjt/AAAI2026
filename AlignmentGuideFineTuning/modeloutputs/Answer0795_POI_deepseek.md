### Intent:
**Intent Summary:**  
Create a 30-line I/O list table for a steel rolling mill's automation system, detailing signal names, types (analog/digital), engineering units, ranges, setpoints, and P&ID references to support PLC/HMI configuration and process control documentation.  

*(Focus: Structured I/O documentation for rolling mill instrumentation and control signals.)*

### Prompt:
**IO List Rolling Mill:**

Create an I/O list as a table with 30 lines for a rolling mill in a steel production plant. Have as columns signal name, input/output, signal tagnumber, analog/digital, engineering unit, ranges, setpoint, and P&ID reference.

**R-T-F:**

ðŸŸ¥ R (Role) â€“ Define Your Role

Act as a control systems engineer responsible for creating detailed I/O documentation for the automation of a rolling mill in a steel production facility.

â¸»

ðŸŸ© T (Task) â€“ Define the Objective

Generate a structured I/O list table containing 30 lines, each representing a control or monitoring signal relevant to the rolling mill process. Each row must include the following columns:
	â€¢	Signal Name
	â€¢	Input/Output
	â€¢	Signal Tagnumber
	â€¢	Analog/Digital
	â€¢	Engineering Unit
	â€¢	Range
	â€¢	Setpoint
	â€¢	P&ID Reference

The list should reflect realistic instrumentation, such as motor speed feedback, roll gap position, cooling valve control, hydraulic pressure, and strip tension.

â¸»

ðŸŸ§ F (Format) â€“ Specify the Output Format

Provide the output as a cleanly formatted table suitable for documentation, HMI/PLC configuration, or Excel import. The format should support:
	â€¢	Clear signal identification and traceability
	â€¢	Inclusion of engineering metadata (units, range, setpoints)
	â€¢	Cross-reference with P&ID diagrams for system integration
	â€¢	Compatibility with control logic implementation and commissioning workflows

ðŸ”µ A (Approach) â€“ Define Your Approach

1. Begin by reviewing the rolling mill's existing control system and identifying all relevant signals.
2. Collect data on each signal, including its name, input/output status, tag number, analog/digital nature, engineering units, range, and setpoint.
3. Cross-reference each signal with the plant's P&ID diagrams to ensure accurate representation and system integration.
4. Organize the collected data into a structured table format, adhering to the specified output format.
5. Review the table for accuracy and completeness, ensuring all signals are accounted for and properly documented.
6. Share the completed I/O list table with relevant stakeholders for review and feedback.
7. Incorporate any necessary revisions and finalize the table.
