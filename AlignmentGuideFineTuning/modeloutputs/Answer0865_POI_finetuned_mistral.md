ðŸŸ¥ T (Task) â€“ What You Need to Do

Develop a self-contained function block in IEC 61131-3 Structured Text to perform multiplication of two 4Ã—4 matrices. This block should be reusable in industrial applications such as robotics, motion control, or transformation operations.

ðŸŸ© A (Action) â€“ How to Do It
	1.	Define the function block MatrixMultiply4x4 with the following structure:
	â€¢	Inputs:
	â€¢	MatrixA: ARRAY[1..4, 1..4] OF REAL
	â€¢	MatrixB: ARRAY[1..4, 1..4] OF REAL
	â€¢	Output:
	â€¢	MatrixC: ARRAY[1..4, 1..4] OF REAL (the product of A Ã— B)
	2.	Implement matrix multiplication logic using three nested FOR loops:
	â€¢	Outer loops iterate through rows of MatrixA and columns of MatrixB
	â€¢	Inner loop performs the dot product and accumulates the result in MatrixC[i,j]
	â€¢	Example:
 
 FOR i := 1 TO 4 DO
    FOR j := 1 TO 4 DO
        MatrixC[i,j] := 0;
        FOR k := 1 TO 4 DO
            MatrixC[i,j] := MatrixC[i,j] + MatrixA[i,k] * MatrixB[k,j];
        END_FOR;
    END_FOR;
END_FOR;

	3.	Comment each part of the code to explain:
	â€¢	The role of each index
	â€¢	Why initialization to zero is important
	â€¢	How the algorithm scales computationally (O(nÂ³))
	4.	Address limitations:
	â€¢	Scaling to larger matrices may impact scan time
	â€¢	Fixed array sizes restrict dynamic use cases
	â€¢	Consider memory and performance trade-offs for real-time systems

ðŸŸ¦ G (Goal) â€“ What You Want to Achieve

Deliver a robust, efficient, and easy-to-maintain function block that enables real-time matrix multiplication in PLC environments. This block should:

	â€¢	Be reusable in applications like:
	â€¢	Robot arm pose calculations
	â€¢	3D coordinate transformation
	â€¢	Kinematic chain modeling

### Analysis

This function block performs matrix multiplication between two 4Ã—4 matrices, `MatrixA` and `MatrixB`, and stores the result in `MatrixC`. The implementation uses three nested FOR loops to iterate through the elements of the matrices, following the standard matrix multiplication formula.

#### Advantages

- **Reusable and modular**: The function block can be easily integrated into larger control programs, such as robotics or motion control, without affecting the main logic.
- **Efficient for small matrices**: The algorithm is suitable for real-time execution on PLCs, as it scales linearly with the matrix size (O(nÂ³) for 4Ã—4 matrices).
- **Clear and structured**: The use of comments and loop indices makes the code
