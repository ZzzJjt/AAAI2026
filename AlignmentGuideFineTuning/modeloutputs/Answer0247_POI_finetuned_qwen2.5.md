### Intent:
**Intent Summary:**  
Develop a Structured Text program to implement a fail-safe pressure relief valve interlock that automatically opens when vessel pressure exceeds a safe limit, maintains protection until pressure normalizes, and includes fault detection with safe-state defaults.

### Prompt:
**Interlock Pressure Relief:**

Develop a self-contained IEC 61131-3 Structured Text program to implement an interlock system for opening a pressure relief valve in a vessel upon detecting overpressure. The program should monitor the vessel pressure using a pressure sensor and trigger the opening of the relief valve when the pressure exceeds a predefined safe limit.

The logic should ensure that the pressure relief valve remains open until the vessel pressure drops below a safe threshold. Additionally, incorporate safety checks to account for sensor failures or valve malfunctions, ensuring that the system defaults to a safe state in the event of a fault. Discuss the significance of pressure relief systems in protecting industrial processes from overpressure hazards and ensuring operational safety.

**C-A-R-E:**

🟥 C (Context) – The Background

In high-pressure industrial processes, pressure vessels must be protected from overpressure conditions that could lead to catastrophic failure, explosions, or environmental hazards. Pressure relief systems are critical safety components designed to respond immediately and reliably when pressure exceeds safe operating limits. Integrating these protections into PLC logic enhances consistency, visibility, and fail-safe behavior.

🟩 A (Action) – The Implementation Task

Develop a self-contained IEC 61131-3 Structured Text program that implements an interlock system for pressure relief. The program should:
	•	Monitor vessel pressure using a pressure sensor (PT)
	•	Automatically open the pressure relief valve (e.g., RELIEF_VALVE := TRUE) when pressure exceeds a predefined high limit
	•	Keep the valve open until the pressure drops below a safe reset threshold
	•	Include fail-safe logic to:
	•	Open the relief valve in case of sensor failure (e.g., stuck reading or invalid value)
	•	Trigger an alert or override if valve malfunction is detected
	•	Default to a safe state (valve open) if interlock status is uncertain

The logic should be designed to operate independently and reliably even during fault conditions.

⸻

🟨 R (Result) – The Expected Outcome

The result is a robust overpressure protection system that:
	•	Automatically responds to dangerous pressure conditions
	•	Maintains the relief valve in a protective state until conditions normalize
	•	Ensures system integrity through fault detection and safe fallback mechanisms
This protects equipment, personnel, and process continuity in a wide range of industries such as oil and gas, chemical manufacturing, and power generation.

⸻

🟦 E (Example) – A Practical Use Case

If the process pressure exceeds 15 bar, the program sets RELIEF_VALVE := TRUE and activates a SHUTDOWN_LATCH := TRUE. The valve remains open until the pressure falls below 12 bar, at which point the latch resets and the valve can safely close. If the pressure sensor becomes unreliable or the valve fails to respond, the logic overrides normal control and forces the valve open, while triggering an operator alarm.
