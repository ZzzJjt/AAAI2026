### Intent:
**Intent Summary:**  
Develop a feedforward control system in Structured Text that adjusts conveyor speed based on predicted load input while enforcing operational speed limits.  

(Concise technical description capturing: control strategy, key input/output, and safety constraints)

### Prompt:
**Ratio Control Mixing:**

Develop a self-contained IEC 61131-3 Structured Text program (not a function block) to implement ratio control for mixing two reactants in a 2:1 ratio. The program should maintain the desired ratio between the two reactants by adjusting their flow rates dynamically, ensuring that for every two parts of reactant A, one part of reactant B is added.

Include logic to monitor the flow rates of both reactants and adjust one flow rate relative to the other to maintain the 2:1 ratio. The program should also handle any disturbances or variations in flow, adjusting the control signals to correct for deviations from the target ratio. Discuss the importance of ratio control in maintaining the desired chemical composition and the impact of disturbances on the mixing process.

	4.	Optionally evaluate the ratio error and raise an alarm if the deviation exceeds the set Tolerance.
	5.	Use Flow_B_SP as a reference for a flow control loop or actuator to maintain the correct ratio.

ðŸŸ¦ E (Expectation) â€“ What You Should Achieve

Your program should:
	â€¢	Maintain a consistent 2:1 mixing ratio between the two reactants
	â€¢	Adapt automatically to fluctuations in reactant Aâ€™s flow rate
