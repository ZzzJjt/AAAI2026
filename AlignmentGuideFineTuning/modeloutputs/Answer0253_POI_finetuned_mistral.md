### Intent:
**Intent Summary:**  
Develop a textual P&ID and IEC 61131-3 Structured Text program to implement safety interlocks for a distillation column (C-101) that trigger automated actions (e.g., valve closures, heating shutdowns) when pressure, temperature, or liquid levels exceed predefined safe limits (e.g., PT-101 > 120 psi, TT-101 > 180Â°C).  

**Key Focus:**  
- Standardized instrumentation tagnames (e.g., PT-101, FV-101).  
- Conditional logic for interlocks (IF-THEN).  
- Mitigation of overpressure, overheating, and flooding risks.  
- Compliance with ISA-5.1 and IEC 61131-3 standards.  

*(Concisely captures the dual deliverablesâ€”P&ID notation and ST codeâ€”with safety-driven automation intent.)*

### Prompt:
**Interlock Distillation Column:**

Develop a P&I diagram in textual notation for a distillation column, detailing the process equipment, instrumentation, control functions, safety interlocks, and piping. Use typical tagnames to represent elements such as the column (C-101), reboiler (E-101), condenser (E-102), level transmitters (LT-101), pressure transmitters (PT-101), and control valves (FV-101). Ensure the notation includes both the control functions and the safety interlocks, specifying their interactions with the piping and instrumentation system.

Following this, write a self-contained IEC 61131-3 Structured Text program to implement the interlocks of the distillation column. Include high and low limits for critical parameters such as pressure, temperature, and liquid level. For instance, trigger the pressure relief valve if the column pressure exceeds 120 psi (high limit) or shut off the feed valve if the pressure drops below 50 psi (low limit). Similarly, close the reboiler heat supply if the temperature exceeds 180Â°C. Discuss the role of interlocks in maintaining safe operating conditions within the distillation process.

**C-A-R-E:**

ðŸŸ¥ C (Context) â€“ The Background

Distillation columns operate under precise conditions, and deviations in pressure, temperature, or level can lead to hazardous situations. To ensure operational safety and compliance with process design intent, engineers must integrate both instrumentation diagrams and interlock logic into the system. Text-based P&ID notation and IEC 61131-3 Structured Text provide a standardized way to represent and program these protective functions.

ðŸŸ© A (Action) â€“ The Implementation Task
	1.	Create a textual P&I diagram for a distillation column, using standard instrumentation tagnames such as:
 
	â€¢	C-101 (Column)
	â€¢	E-101 (Reboiler)
	â€¢	E-102 (Condenser)
	â€¢	PT-101, TT-101, LT-101 (Pressure, Temperature, and Level Transmitters)
	â€¢	FV-101 (Feed Valve), PRV-101 (Pressure Relief Valve)
 
The diagram should outline both control functions (e.g. temperature control loop from TT-101 to reboiler) and interlock actions (e.g. isolating feed or shutting off heating).
	2.	Develop an IEC 61131-3 Structured Text (ST) program to implement interlocks. Use clear IF-THEN logic to trigger actions based on process limits. Examples include:
 
	â€¢	Opening PRV-101 if PT-101 > 120 psi
	â€¢	Closing FV-101 if PT-101 < 50 psi
	â€¢	Shutting off reboiler heating if TT-101 > 180Â°C
 
	3.	Explain how each interlock maintains safe reactor operation by mitigating risks such as overpressure, overheating, and product flooding.

ðŸŸ¨ R (Result) â€“ The Expected Outcome

The result is a well-documented and automated safety strategy for the distillation column. The text-based P&I diagram enhances communication between engineering and operations teams, while the ST interlock code ensures that safety actions are executed promptly and consistently based on real-time process data. This reduces downtime, prevents accidents, and supports regulatory compliance.

â¸»

ðŸŸ¦ E (Example) â€“ A Practical Use Case

If PT-101 detects pressure rising above 120 psi, the logic automatically opens PRV-101 to relieve excess pressure. If pressure drops below 50 psiâ€”indicating a vacuum riskâ€”the system closes FV-101 to stop feed input. Similarly, if TT-101 exceeds 180Â°C, the reboiler is shut down to prevent thermal damage. These interlocks work together to maintain a safe and stable operation of the distillation process.
