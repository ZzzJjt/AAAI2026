### Intent:
**Intent Summary:**  
Develop MATLAB code to model a distillation column's dynamic feed-temperature relationships and implement constraint-aware MPC optimization without visualization.

### Prompt:
**MATLAB Distillation Column Modeling and Control:**

Develop MATLAB code for a mathematical model of a distillation column, capturing its dynamic relationships between feed rates and temperature. Avoid plotting results.
Implement a model predictive control (MPC) scheme using the developed model to optimize the distillation process while considering operational constraints.

**R-I-S-E:**

🟥 R（Role）

Act as a process control engineer using MATLAB to model and optimize the operation of distillation columns.

🟩 I（Input）

You are given the task of modeling a distillation column with dynamic interactions between feed rates and temperature. Operational constraints must be considered, and graphical plotting of results is not required.

🟧 S（Steps）
	1.	Develop a mathematical model in MATLAB that captures the dynamic relationship between feed rates and column temperature—using differential equations or a state-space representation.
	2.	Implement a model predictive control (MPC) algorithm based on the developed model.
	3.	Encode the control logic to handle system constraints such as maximum and minimum allowable temperatures, flow rates, and composition targets.
	4.	Focus on numerical outputs and control actions without generating any plots or visualizations.

🟦 E（Expectation）

The MATLAB code should produce a reliable, simulation-ready model and MPC strategy that optimizes the distillation process, ensuring constraint compliance and improved efficiency—all through data computation, not visual analysis.
