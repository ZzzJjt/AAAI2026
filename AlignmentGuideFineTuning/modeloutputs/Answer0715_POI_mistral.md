### Intent:
**Intent Summary:**  
Create an IEC 61131-3 ST function block to read five process values from an IO-Link master, including communication handling, error checking, and status reporting for each value.  

*(Key focus: IO-Link data acquisition with robust error handling and status feedback.)*

### Prompt:
**IO-Link Data Acquisition Using 61131-3 Structured Text:**

Develop a function block in structured text (ST) based on IEC 61131 standards to read five values from a remote IO-Link master. The function block should handle communication with the IO-Link master, retrieve the required process data, and provide the status of each read operation. Discuss the methodology used for error checking, status reporting, and handling of potential communication issues between the IO-Link master and the connected devices.

**R-T-F:**

ðŸŸ¥ R (Role) â€“ Your Role

Act as a PLC programmer developing communication function blocks using IEC 61131-3 Structured Text for IO-Link-based industrial systems.

ðŸŸ© T (Task) â€“ What You Need to Do

Create a function block that reads five process values from a remote IO-Link master. The block should manage communication with the IO-Link master, retrieve and store the values, and return the status of each read operation. It should also include error handling and reporting logic to deal with potential communication issues such as timeouts, invalid responses, or device errors.

ðŸŸ§ F (Format) â€“ Expected Output

Provide an IEC 61131-3 compliant ST function block that includes:
	â€¢	Inputs: read trigger, IO-Link addresses or indexes
	â€¢	Outputs: five process values and corresponding read status indicators
	â€¢	Logic for handling communication requests and parsing IO-Link responses
	â€¢	Error-checking mechanisms and status reporting per value
	â€¢	Well-commented code for easy maintenance and integration

	â€¢	Well-commented code for easy maintenance and integration with other PLC programs

**Methodology:**

1. Define the inputs and outputs for the function block, including the read trigger and IO-Link addresses or indexes.
2. Initialize variables for the process values, read status indicators, and communication-related parameters (e.g., timeout, retry count).
3. Implement a communication loop that checks the read trigger and, if set, sends a request to the IO-Link master for the specified values.
4. Parse the received IO-Link response, checking for valid data and error codes. If an error occurs, increment the retry count and check if it has reached the maximum allowed value. If so, set the corresponding read status indicator to an error state and return.
5. Store the retrieved process values and set the read status indicators to success.
6. Include error-handling logic for communication issues such as timeouts, invalid responses, or device errors. Report these errors through the read status indicators.
7. Add comments to the code for easy maintenance and integration with other PLC programs.

**Example Code:**

```st
PROGRAM IO_Link_Data_Acquisition
VAR
    ReadTrigger: BOOL;
    IO_Link_Addresses: ARRAY[1..5] OF INT;
    Values: ARRAY[1..5] OF REAL;

    Timeout: TON;
    RetryCount: INT;
    Response: BYTE_ARRAY[1..255];
    ErrorCode: INT;
    i: INT;

    COMMUNICATION_LOOP
        IF ReadTrigger THEN
            Timeout.Q := FALSE;
            RetryCount := 0;
            FOR i := 1 TO 5 DO
                IO_Link_Master.RequestData(IO_Link_Addresses[i], Response);
                IF Response.Length > 0 THEN
                    IF Response[1] = 0x01 THEN
                        IF Response.Length >= 5 THEN
                            Values[i] := Response[2] + (Response[3] * 256);
                            Status[i] := TRUE;
                        ELSE
