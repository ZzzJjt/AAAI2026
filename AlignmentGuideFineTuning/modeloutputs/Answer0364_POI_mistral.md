### Intent:
"Create a reusable IEC 61131-3 structured text function block that converts Fahrenheit to Celsius with input validation and status flagging for industrial PLC applications."

### Prompt:
**Fahrenheit to Celsius:**
Implement a self-contained function block in IEC 61131-3 structured text to convert Fahrenheit to Celsius. Ensure it handles input validation and provides accurate results.

**C-A-R-E:**

🟥 C (Context) – Background Situation

Temperature conversion between Fahrenheit and Celsius is frequently needed in industrial control systems—especially in HVAC, process heating, and international deployments. Relying on manual calculations or repeated code snippets can lead to inconsistencies, rounding errors, and logic duplication. A dedicated, reusable Structured Text function block ensures accuracy, validation, and consistent integration into PLC programs.

🟩 A (Action) – Task to Perform

Create a self-contained function block in IEC 61131-3 Structured Text that:
	•	Accepts a temperature input in Fahrenheit
	•	Converts the value to Celsius using the formula:
 C = (F - 32) \times \frac{5}{9}
	•	Performs input validation, such as checking that the input is not below absolute zero (−459.67°F)
	•	Outputs the result in Celsius, along with a ValidInput boolean status flag
	•	Includes clear comments, modular structure, and scan-cycle-safe logic

⸻

🟨 R (Result) – Expected Outcome

The outcome should be a modular and reliable function block that can be reused in any program requiring Fahrenheit-to-Celsius conversion. It will offer:
	•	Accurate results using real data types
	•	Built-in validation to protect against invalid sensor readings
	•	Clean, maintainable code suitable for both educational and production PLC applications

⸻

🟦 E (Example) – Concrete Illustration

Example logic inside the function block:
IF Fahrenheit >= -459.67 THEN
   Celsius := (Fahrenheit - 32.0) * 5.0 / 9.0;
   ValidInput := TRUE;
ELSE
   Celsius := 0.0;
   ValidInput := FALSE;
END_IF;
Inputs:
	•	Fahrenheit : REAL

Outputs:
	•	Celsius : REAL
	•	ValidInput : BOOL

🟦 E (Extra) – Additional Considerations

	•	Consider using a library of utility functions to simplify the code and improve readability
	•	Include comments explaining the purpose of each variable and the logic flow
	•	Optimize the function block for performance and memory usage
	•	Test the function block with various input values to ensure correct operation and robustness
	•	Consider adding error handling for exceptional cases, such as division by zero or overflow
	•	Ensure the function block is compatible with the target PLC platform and IEC 61131-3 standard
