### Intent:
**Intent Summary:**  
Create an IEC 61131-3 Structured Text program to control an elevator system, managing floor requests, door timing, and directional movement while prioritizing safety and efficient operation.

### Prompt:
**Heating System Control Using 61131-3 Structured Text:**

Write a self-contained 61131-3 structured text program (not a function block) to control the temperature of a heating system. The system should use input from three temperature sensors to automatically turn the heating on and off, maintaining a constant temperature range between 20Â°C and 22Â°C. The program must ensure smooth temperature regulation and prioritize energy efficiency by minimizing frequent switching. Safety measures should be implemented to handle sensor faults or temperature deviations beyond the specified range.

ðŸŸ© A (Action) â€“ How to Do It
	1.	Read sensor inputs:
	â€¢	TempSensor1, TempSensor2, TempSensor3 are REAL values in Â°C.
	2.	Compute average temperature:
	â€¢	Use the three sensors to calculate a reliable average (AvgTemp) for smooth control.
	3.	Check for safety:
	â€¢	If any sensor reads below 10Â°C or above 30Â°C, raise a SensorFault flag and turn off the heating for safety.
	4.	Control the heating system with hysteresis:
	â€¢	If AvgTemp < 20.0Â°C and no fault â†’ turn heating ON
	â€¢	If AvgTemp > 22.0Â°C and no fault â†’ turn heating OFF
	â€¢	Maintain current state when AvgTemp is between 20â€“22Â°C to avoid frequent switching.

	â€¢	Use the calculated average temperature to turn the heating on or off, ensuring that the temperature remains within the specified range.
	â€¢	Implement hysteresis logic to prevent frequent switching of the heating system.
	4.	Implement safety checks:
	â€¢	Add logic to handle sensor faults or temperature deviations beyond the specified range. For example, if any sensor reads below 10Â°C or above 30Â°C, turn off the heating for safety.
	â€¢	Implement a timer to ensure that the heating remains off for a safe period after a sensor fault is detected.
