Certainly! Below is a detailed explanation of the control logic for a pressure regulation loop using a cascaded PID controller in IEC 61131-3 Structured Text. The outer loop controls pressure, while the inner loop adjusts flow rate to maintain the desired pressure setpoint.

### Outer Loop (Pressure Control)

```st
// Set pressure setpoint (e.g., 10 bar)
PressureSetpoint := 10.0;

// Measure current pressure (e.g., from sensor)
CurrentPressure := ReadPressureSensor();

// Calculate pressure error
PressureError := PressureSetpoint - CurrentPressure;

// Inner loop (flow control)

// Set flow setpoint (e.g., 500 L/min)
FlowSetpoint := 500.0;

// Measure current flow rate (e.g., from flow meter)
CurrentFlow := ReadFlowMeter();

// Calculate flow error
FlowError := FlowSetpoint - CurrentFlow;

// Tune inner loop PID parameters
P_Flow := 1.0;
I_Flow := 0.1;
D_Flow := 0.05;

// Compute flow control output (e.g., valve position)
FlowOutput := P_Flow * FlowError + I_Flow * Integrate(FlowError, T#100MS);
FlowOutput := FlowOutput + D_Flow * (FlowError - PrevFlowError);

// Update outer loop PID parameters
P_Pressure := 2.0;
I_Pressure := 0.2;
D_Pressure := 0.1;

// Compute pressure control output (e.g., control valve position)
PressureOutput := P_Pressure * PressureError + I_Pressure * Integrate(PressureError, T#100MS);
PressureOutput := PressureOutput + D_Pressure * (PressureError - PrevPressureError);

// Clamp output to safe limits
IF PressureOutput > MaxPressureOutput THEN
    PressureOutput := MaxPressureOutput;
ELSIF PressureOutput < MinPressureOutput THEN
