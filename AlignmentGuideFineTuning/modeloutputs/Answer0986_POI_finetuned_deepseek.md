### Intent:
**Intent Summary:**  
Create a structured I/O list table for feedwater control in a power plant's steam-water cycle, including signal names, tags, types, units, ranges, setpoints, and P&ID references, to support automation design and documentation.  

*(Concise engineering intent for generating a traceable I/O configuration table.)*

### Prompt:
**IO List Steam Water Cycle:**

Create an I/O list as a table for feedwater control in a steam-water cycle in a power plant. Have as columns names, signal tagnumber, analog/digital, engineering unit, ranges, setpoint, and P&ID reference.

**T-A-G:**

ðŸŸ¥ T (Task)

Develop an I/O list table for the feedwater control system in a steam-water cycle within a power plant.

â¸»

ðŸŸ© A (Action)
	â€¢	Create a table where each row defines one I/O signal related to feedwater control.
	â€¢	Include the following columns:
	â€¢	Signal Name
	â€¢	Signal Tag Number
	â€¢	Analog/Digital
	â€¢	Engineering Unit
	â€¢	Range
	â€¢	Setpoint
	â€¢	P&ID Reference
	â€¢	Populate the list with signals such as drum level transmitters, feedwater control valves, flow transmitters, and pump status feedbacks.
	â€¢	Use realistic values for units, setpoints, and ranges to ensure engineering accuracy.
	â€¢	Organize the table to be clear, structured, and ready for use in PLC/HMI configuration or project documentation.

ðŸŸ¦ G (Goal)

Provide a complete and traceable I/O reference that supports automation design, instrumentation layout, and integration with P&ID drawingsâ€”ensuring consistency and accuracy in the implementation of the feedwater control loop.
