### Intent:
**Intent Summary:**  
Develop an IEC 61131-3 Structured Text function block to reliably read five process values from an IO-Link master, including error handling and status reporting for robust industrial communication.  

*(Focus: IO-Link data acquisition, fault tolerance, and real-time diagnostics in ST.)*

### Prompt:
**IO-Link Data Acquisition Using 61131-3 Structured Text:**

Develop a function block in structured text (ST) based on IEC 61131 standards to read five values from a remote IO-Link master. The function block should handle communication with the IO-Link master, retrieve the required process data, and provide the status of each read operation. Discuss the methodology used for error checking, status reporting, and handling of potential communication issues between the IO-Link master and the connected devices.

**R-I-S-E:**

ðŸŸ¥ R (Role) â€“ Your Role

Act as an industrial automation engineer developing IEC 61131-3 Structured Text (ST) function blocks for device-level communication using IO-Link.

ðŸŸ© I (Input) â€“ What Youâ€™re Given

You need to create a function block that communicates with a remote IO-Link master to read five process values. The block must manage communication with the master, handle potential read errors, and report the status of each read operation. Reliability, fault tolerance, and status transparency are essential.

ðŸŸ§ S (Steps) â€“ What to Do
	1.	Define input parameters to initiate reading and identify IO-Link channels or data objects.
	2.	Implement logic to communicate with the IO-Link master and sequentially or concurrently retrieve five process values.
	3.	For each read, verify the result and generate a corresponding status output (e.g., success, timeout, CRC error).
	4.	Add error-handling routines to retry failed reads or flag issues to the controller, ensuring traceability and real-time feedback.

ðŸŸ¦ E (Expectation) â€“ What Success Looks Like

The resulting function block should reliably read five values from an IO-Link master, return those values along with individual read statuses, and provide built-in error detection. This enables real-time diagnostics, enhances data integrity, and ensures robust IO-Link communication under varying network conditions.

The function block should be designed for easy integration into larger automation systems and should adhere to IEC 61131-3 standards for structured text programming.

**Function Block Design:**

```structuredtext
FUNCTION_BLOCK IO_Link_Reader
VAR_INPUT
    Start: BOOL; // Start reading process values
    Channel: INT; // IO-Link channel or data object identifier
    Timeout: TIME; // Timeout for read operations
END_VAR

VAR_OUTPUT
    Value1, Value2, Value3, Value4, Value5: REAL; // Process values
    Status1, Status2, Status3, Status4, Status5: BOOL; // Status of each read operation
END_VAR

VAR
    Connection: IO_Link_Connection; // IO-Link connection object
    ReadResult: BOOL; // Result of read operation
    ReadStatus: BOOL; // Status of read operation
END_VAR

METHOD StartReading
    IF Start THEN
        // Initialize IO-Link connection
        Connection.Initialize(Channel);
        
        // Read values sequentially or concurrently
        ReadResult := Connection.ReadValue(Value1, Timeout);
        ReadStatus := ReadResult;
        Status1 := ReadStatus;
        
        ReadResult := Connection.ReadValue(Value2, Timeout);
        ReadStatus := ReadResult;
        Status2 := ReadStatus;
        
        ReadResult := Connection.ReadValue(Value3, Timeout);
        ReadStatus := ReadResult;
        Status3 := ReadStatus;
        
        ReadResult := Connection.ReadValue(Value4, Timeout);
        ReadStatus := ReadResult;
        Status4 := ReadStatus;
        
        ReadResult := Connection.ReadValue(Value5, Timeout);
        ReadStatus := ReadResult;
        Status5 := ReadStatus;
        
        // Close connection
        Connection.Close();
    END_IF;
END_METHOD
```

**Error Handling and Status Reporting:**

- **Retry Mechanism:** Implement a retry mechanism for failed reads, with configurable retry counts and delays.
- **Timeout Handling:** Set a timeout for each read operation to prevent indefinite waiting and provide a clear indication of a communication issue.
- **CRC Error Detection:** Include CRC error detection in the read process to ensure data integrity.
- **Status Outputs:** Provide detailed status outputs for each read operation, indicating success, timeout, CRC error, or other issues.

**Integration and Testing:**

- **Integration:** Ensure the function block is easily integrated into larger automation systems, adhering to IEC 61131-3 standards for structured text
