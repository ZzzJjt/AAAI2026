### Intent:
**Intent Summary:**  
Create a reusable IEC 61131-3 function block in Structured Text to accurately convert a 10-digit decimal value to a hexadecimal string, handling edge cases (e.g., large values, overflows) for industrial diagnostics or communication.  

*(Focus: Decimal-to-hex conversion, robustness, and integration for PLCs/HMI systems.)*

### Prompt:
**DecToHex:**
Implement a self-contained function block in IEC 61131-3 structured text to convert a 10-digit decimal value to hexadecimal. Ensure proper handling of large values and edge cases.

ðŸŸ¥ B (Before) â€“ The Problem or Challenge

In industrial automation systems, thereâ€™s often a need to display or log numerical data in hexadecimal format, especially for diagnostics, memory addresses, or communication protocols. However, standard data type limitations and lack of built-in conversion tools in some PLCs make it challenging to safely convert large decimal values (up to 10 digits) into hex. Failing to handle edge casesâ€”such as overflows or unsupported value rangesâ€”can lead to runtime errors or incorrect results.

ðŸŸ© A (After) â€“ The Desired Outcome

Develop a self-contained function block in IEC 61131-3 Structured Text that converts a 10-digit decimal value to its hexadecimal representation. The function block should:
	â€¢	Accept a large decimal input (e.g., up to 9999999999)
	â€¢	Perform accurate conversion to a hex string
	â€¢	Handle edge cases, such as values at or beyond the upper limit of the platformâ€™s numeric range
	â€¢	Return the result as a STRING or ARRAY of characters for easy integration with HMI, logging, or communication logic

â¸»

ðŸŸ§ B (Bridge) â€“ How to Get There
	1.	Define the function block interface with inputs like:
	â€¢	DecValue : DINT or LINT (depending on platform)
	2.	Use internal logic to:
	â€¢	Loop through the value using modulo and division by 16
	â€¢	Convert numeric remainders (0â€“15) into corresponding ASCII hex characters ('0'..'F')
	â€¢	Build the hex string in reverse, then output it correctly
	3.	Output:
	â€¢	HexString : STRING or equivalent
	4.	Add input validation and comments to explain logic and platform-specific constraints.

**Example:**

```ST
Function Block DecToHex
Inputs:
  DecValue : DINT;
Outputs:
  HexString : STRING(2);

Begin
  // Validate input
  If DecValue < 0 Or DecValue > 9999999999 Then
    HexString := 'ERR';
    Exit;
  End If;

  // Convert to hex
  HexString := '';
  While DecValue > 0 Do
    Local Remainder : DINT := DecValue Mod 16;
    DecValue := DecValue \ 16;
    Case Remainder
      Of 0 : HexString := '0' + HexString;
      Of 1 : HexString := '1' + HexString;
      Of 2 : HexString := '2' + HexString;
      Of 3 : HexString := '3' + HexString;
      Of 4 : HexString := '4' + HexString;
      Of 5 : HexString := '5' + HexString;
      Of 6 : HexString := '6' + HexString;
      Of 7 : HexString := '7' + HexString;
      Of 8 : HexString := '8' + HexString;
      Of 9 : HexString := '9' + HexString;
      Of 10 : HexString := 'A' + HexString;
      Of 11 : HexString := 'B' + HexString;
      Of 12 : HexString := 'C' + HexString;
      Of 13 : HexString := 'D' + HexString;
      Of 14 : HexString := 'E' + HexString;
      Of 15 : HexString := 'F' + HexString;
    End Case;
  End While;

End
```

**Additional Considerations:**

1.	**Platform-Specific Constraints:** Ensure the function block is compatible with the target PLC's data type range and memory limitations. For example, some PLCs may not support DINT or LINT data types, or have a limited string length.
2.	**Error Handling:** Consider adding more robust error handling, such as checking for invalid input types or returning an error code instead of a string.
3.	**Efficiency:** Optimize the function block for performance, especially when dealing with large values or frequent conversions. This may involve using bitwise operations or pre-calculating conversion tables.
4.	**
