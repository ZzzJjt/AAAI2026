### Intent:
**Intent Summary:**  
Develop a structured text function block to retrieve and process PowerLink node diagnostics, including reachability, error codes, and health status, triggered either manually or cyclically, with robust error handling and status reporting.

### Prompt:
**Profibus DPV1 Diagnostics Using 61131-3 Structured Text:**

Develop a self-contained 61131-3 structured text program to retrieve diagnostic data from a Profibus device using the Profibus DPV1 protocol. The program should implement a CASE statement to handle 10 specific diagnostic data types, such as communication errors, device status, and parameter faults. Each diagnostic type should be mapped to a concrete data type, ensuring that the retrieved information is processed accurately and efficiently. Discuss the logic behind handling these diagnostic data types, including error detection and fault handling mechanisms, to ensure robust communication with the Profibus device.

**R-I-S-E:**

ðŸŸ¥ R (Role) â€“ Your Role

Act as a PLC software engineer developing advanced diagnostic handling routines using IEC 61131-3 Structured Text for Profibus DPV1 communication.

â¸»

ðŸŸ© I (Input) â€“ What Youâ€™re Given

You are tasked with developing a self-contained Structured Text (ST) program to retrieve and process diagnostic data from a Profibus DPV1 slave device. The program must support 10 specific diagnostic types, including communication errors, device status, parameter faults, hardware warnings, and manufacturer-specific codes. Each type must be clearly identified, parsed, and mapped to a structured data type.

â¸»

ðŸŸ§ S (Steps) â€“ What You Need to Do
	1.	Initiate a DPV1 diagnostic read request to the target Profibus device using a trigger mechanism (e.g. rising edge of Execute input).
	2.	Receive and parse the diagnostic response, extracting the diagnostic type identifier from the data block.
	3.	Use a CASE statement to handle each of the 10 diagnostic types. For each type:
	â€¢	Map the diagnostic data to a corresponding structured variable or native type
	â€¢	Set status flags or fault indicators
	â€¢	Log or output the diagnostic information for visualization or program logic
	4.	Implement error-handling logic to deal with invalid, incomplete, or unsupported responses. Return error codes and activate fallback logic if needed.

â¸»

ðŸŸ¦ E (Expectation) â€“ What Success Looks Like

The final program enables the PLC to reliably interpret and react to detailed Profibus DPV1 diagnostics in real time. Operators and control logic gain access to structured, actionable diagnostic data, improving fault response, enabling condition-based maintenance, and enhancing system transparency and uptime.
