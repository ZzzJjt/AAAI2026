### Intent:
**Intent Summary:**  
Generate a 30-entry I/O list table for a steel rolling mill, including signal names, types, ranges, setpoints, and P&ID references, to standardize control system documentation and integration.  

**Code-Generation Intent:**  
*"Create a structured I/O list table with 30 entries for a rolling millâ€™s control system, covering analog/digital signals, engineering units, ranges, setpoints, and P&ID links."*

### Prompt:
**IO List Rolling Mill:**

Create an I/O list as a table with 30 lines for a rolling mill in a steel production plant. Have as columns signal name, input/output, signal tagnumber, analog/digital, engineering unit, ranges, setpoint, and P&ID reference.

**T-A-G:**

ðŸŸ¥ T (Task)

Develop a detailed I/O list table with 30 entries for a rolling mill in a steel production plant.

â¸»

ðŸŸ© A (Action)
	â€¢	Create a table with the following columns:
	â€¢	Signal Name
	â€¢	Input/Output
	â€¢	Signal Tagnumber
	â€¢	Analog/Digital
	â€¢	Engineering Unit
	â€¢	Range
	â€¢	Setpoint

**R-I-S-E:**

ðŸŸ¥ R (Role) â€“ Your Role

You are a control systems engineer or automation process documentation manager responsible for creating a standardized I/O list for a rolling mill in a steel production plant. Your objective is to ensure that all relevant signals are accurately documented, including signal names, types, ranges, setpoints, and P&ID references.

â¸»

ðŸŸ© I (Input) â€“ What Youâ€™re Given

You are tasked with developing an I/O list for a rolling mill that includes:
	â€¢	30 signal entries
	â€¢	Signal names, tagnumber, and P&ID reference
	â€¢	Input/output classification
	â€¢	Analog/digital signal types
	â€¢	Engineering units and ranges
	â€¢	Setpoint values

â¸»

ðŸŸ§ S (Steps) â€“ How to Do It

	1.	Create a table with the required columns:
	â€¢	Signal Name
	â€¢	Input/Output
	â€¢	Signal Tagnumber
	â€¢	Analog/Digital
	â€¢	Engineering Unit
	â€¢	Range
	â€¢	Setpoint
	â€¢	P&ID Reference
	2.	For each of the 30 signals, fill in the appropriate data:
	â€¢	Signal Name: Provide a descriptive name for the signal (e.g., "Roll Speed Feedback").
	â€¢	Input/Output: Specify whether the signal is an input or output (e.g., I for input, O for output).
	â€¢	Signal Tagnumber: Assign a tagnumber to the signal (e.g., T-A-G-001).
	â€¢	Analog/Digital: Categorize the signal as analog or digital (e.g., A for analog, D for digital).
	â€¢	Engineering Unit: Include the engineering unit for the signal (e.g., m/s for speed, bar for pressure).
	â€¢	Range: Provide the valid range of the signal (e.g., 0â€“100 m/s for speed, 0â€“100 bar for pressure).
	â€¢	Setpoint: Include the setpoint value for the signal (e.g., 50 m/s for speed, 50 bar for pressure).
	â€¢	P&ID Reference: Provide the P&ID reference number for the signal (e.g., P&ID-001).
	3.	Ensure that the table is well-organized and includes all the required columns and signal entries.
