### Intent:
**Intent Summary:**  
Develop an IEC 61131-3 Structured Text program to implement feedforward control for a conveyor belt, adjusting its speed proactively based on predicted load input (via sensor data) to optimize efficiency and prevent overloading/underloading, while adhering to operational speed limits.

### Prompt:
**Feedforward Control Conveyor:**

Develop a self-contained IEC 61131-3 Structured Text program (not a function block) to implement feedforward control for adjusting the speed of a conveyor belt based on sensor-predicted load changes. The program should use input from sensors that predict the weight or volume of material entering the conveyor system, allowing for real-time adjustments to the belt speed before a load change occurs.

Include logic that calculates the required conveyor speed based on the predicted load and adjusts the motor speed accordingly, ensuring that the conveyor operates efficiently without overloading or underloading. Discuss the benefits of feedforward control in conveyor systems, particularly in reducing delays and improving response times compared to feedback-only control strategies.

**Benefits of Feedforward Control in Conveyor Systems:**

Feedforward control in conveyor systems offers several advantages over traditional feedback-only control strategies:

1. **Reduced Response Time:** By predicting and adjusting the conveyor speed based on anticipated load changes, feedforward control can react more quickly to variations in material flow, reducing the time it takes to stabilize the system.

2. **Improved Efficiency:** Proactive adjustments to conveyor speed can prevent overloading or underloading, ensuring that the conveyor operates at its optimal capacity. This leads to better overall efficiency and reduced waste.

3. **Jammed Prevention:** Feedforward control can help prevent conveyor jams by adjusting the speed before a load change occurs, reducing the risk of material buildup or blockages.

4. **Enhanced System Stability:** By anticipating and compensating for load changes, feedforward control can help maintain a more stable and predictable system, reducing the need for frequent adjustments and improving overall system reliability.

5. **Cost Savings:** By optimizing conveyor operation, feedforward control can help reduce energy consumption and maintenance costs, leading to long-term cost savings for the manufacturing plant.

In summary, implementing feedforward control in conveyor systems can lead to improved efficiency, reduced response time, and enhanced system stability, ultimately resulting in a more cost-effective and reliable manufacturing process.
