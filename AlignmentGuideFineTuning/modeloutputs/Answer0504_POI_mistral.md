ðŸŸ© I (Input) â€“ What Youâ€™re Given

You are required to build a function block called SimplexSolver that:
	â€¢	Solves linear programming problems using the Simplex algorithm
	â€¢	Accepts:
	â€¢	An array for the objective function coefficients (e.g., C: ARRAY[1..N] OF REAL)
	â€¢	A constraint matrix (e.g., A: ARRAY[1..M,1..N] OF REAL)
	â€¢	A right-hand side array (B: ARRAY[1..M] OF REAL)
	â€¢	Produces:
	â€¢	An optimal solution vector (X: ARRAY[1..N] OF REAL)
	â€¢	The optimal objective function value
	â€¢	A status flag (e.g., solution found, infeasible, max iterations reached)
	â€¢	Operates under PLC constraints, including fixed memory, bounded loop execution, and limited floating-point precision

ðŸŸ§ S (Steps) â€“ What You Need to Do
	1.	Define the function block interface with arrays sized for typical industrial applications (e.g., max 5 variables, 5 constraints).
	2.	Implement the core Simplex method:
	â€¢	Initialize the Simplex tableau
	â€¢	Identify the pivot column and row
	â€¢	Perform row operations to update the tableau
	â€¢	Repeat until optimality or iteration limit is reached
	3.	Add inline comments to explain:
	â€¢	Mathematical steps (e.g., pivot logic, ratio tests)
	â€¢	Performance considerations (e.g., avoid recursion, use FOR loops)
	â€¢	Error-handling (e.g., division by zero, unbounded solutions)
	4.	Integrate safety and performance limits, including:
	â€¢	Max iteration count
	â€¢	Output flag for infeasibility
	â€¢	Optional watchdog trigger or time-slicing logic

ðŸŸ¦ E (Expectation) â€“ What Success Looks Like

You produce a modular, reusable function block that allows a PLC to perform basic linear optimization autonomously. The block:
	â€¢	Handles small LP problems in real time
	â€¢	Is documented and structured for clarity and maintainability
	â€¢	Enables optimization tasks such as:
	â€¢	Resource allocation
	â€¢	Load distribution
	â€¢	Blending/mixing ratios
	â€¢	Provides deterministic outputs, supporting control system decision-making without relying on external solvers or cloud connectivity

ðŸŸ¦ C (Concerns) â€“ What Might Block Progress

Implementing a linear programming solver in a PLC environment presents several challenges:
	â€¢	Limited memory: The Simplex method requires significant memory to store the tableau, which may exceed the PLC's available memory.
	â€¢	Processing power: The Simplex method requires multiple iterations, which may exceed the PLC's processing power or loop execution time.
	â€¢	Floating-point precision: PLCs may have limited floating-point precision, leading to inaccurate solutions or instability.
	â€¢	Error-handling: Implementing robust error-handling for edge cases (e.g., division by zero, unbounded solutions) can be complex and time-consuming.
	â€¢	Integration with existing control logic: The SimplexSolver function block must be integrated with existing control logic, potentially requiring additional programming and testing.

ðŸŸ¦ W (Ways Forward) â€“ Potential Solutions

To address the challenges of implementing a linear programming solver in a PLC environment:
	â€¢	Optimize the Simplex method for PLC constraints:
	â€¢	Use compact data structures (e.g., sparse matrices)
	â€¢	Implement efficient row operations
	â€¢	Limit the number of iterations
	â€¢	Use fixed-point arithmetic for improved precision
	â€¢	Implement error-handling strategies:
	â€¢	Check for division by zero
	â€¢	Handle unbounded solutions
	â€¢	Implement watchdog triggers or time-slicing logic to prevent infinite loops
	â€¢	Integrate the SimplexSolver function block with existing control logic:
	â€¢	Use well-documented interfaces
	â€¢	Test thoroughly to ensure compatibility and performance
	â€¢	Consider using a separate PLC for optimization tasks if memory and processing power limitations become too severe.
