🟥 R (Role) – Your Role

You are a PLC programmer or control systems engineer tasked with implementing an on-device linear programming solver using the Simplex method, optimized for real-time industrial environments through IEC 61131-3 Structured Text.

⸻

🟩 I (Input) – What You’re Given

You are required to build a function block called SimplexSolver that:
	•	Solves linear programming problems using the Simplex algorithm
	•	Accepts:
	•	An array for the objective function coefficients (e.g., C: ARRAY[1..N] OF REAL)
	•	A constraint matrix (e.g., A: ARRAY[1..M,1..N] OF REAL)
	•	A right-hand side array (B: ARRAY[1..M] OF REAL)
	•	Produces:
	•	An optimal solution vector (X: ARRAY[1..N] OF REAL)
	•	The optimal objective function value
	•	A status flag (e.g., solution found, infeasible, max iterations reached)
	•	Operates under PLC constraints, including fixed memory, bounded loop execution, and limited floating-point precision

⸻

🟧 S (Steps) – What You Need to Do
	1.	Define the function block interface with arrays sized for typical industrial applications (e.g., max 5 variables, 5 constraints).
	2.	Implement the core Simplex method:
	•	Initialize the Simplex tableau
	•	Identify the pivot column and row
	•	Perform row operations to update the tableau
	•	Repeat until optimality or iteration limit is reached
	3.	Add inline comments to explain:
	•	Mathematical steps (e.g., pivot logic, ratio tests)
	•	Performance considerations (e.g., avoid recursion, use FOR loops)
	•	Error-handling (e.g., division by zero, unbounded solutions)
	4.	Integrate safety and performance limits, including:
	•	Max iteration count
	•	Output flag for infeasibility
	•	Optional watchdog trigger or time-slicing logic

⸻

🟦 E (Expectation) – What Success Looks Like

You produce a modular, reusable function block that allows a PLC to perform basic linear optimization autonomously. The block:
	•	Handles small LP problems in real time
	•	Is documented and structured for clarity and maintainability
	•	Enables optimization tasks such as:
	•	Resource allocation
	•	Load distribution
	•	Blending/mixing ratios
	•	Provides deterministic outputs, supporting control system decision-making without relying on external solvers or cloud connectivity

🟦 C (Concerns) – What Might Block Progress

Implementing a linear programming solver in a PLC environment presents several challenges:
	•	Limited memory: The Simplex method requires significant memory to store the tableau, which may exceed the PLC's available memory.
	•	Processing power: The Simplex method requires multiple iterations, which may exceed the PLC's processing power or loop execution time.
	•	Floating-point precision: PLCs may have limited floating-point precision, leading to inaccurate solutions or instability.
	•	Error-handling: Implementing robust error-handling for edge cases (e.g., division by zero, unbounded solutions) can be complex and time-consuming.
	•	Integration with existing control logic: The SimplexSolver function block must be integrated with existing control logic, potentially requiring additional programming and testing.

🟦 W (Ways Forward) – Potential Solutions

To address the challenges of implementing a linear programming solver in a PLC environment:
	•	Optimize the Simplex method for PLC constraints:
	•	Use compact data structures (e.g., sparse matrices)
	•	Implement efficient row operations
	•	Limit the number of iterations
	•	Use fixed-point arithmetic for improved precision
	•	Implement error-handling strategies:
	•	Check for division by zero
	•	Handle unbounded solutions
	•	Implement watchdog triggers or time-slicing logic to prevent infinite loops
	•	Integrate the SimplexSolver function block with existing control logic:
	•	Use well-documented interfaces
	•	Test thoroughly to ensure compatibility and performance
	•	Consider using a separate PLC for optimization tasks if memory and processing power limitations become too severe.
