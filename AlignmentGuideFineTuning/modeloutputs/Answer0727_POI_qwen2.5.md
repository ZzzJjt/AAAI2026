### Intent:
**Intent Summary:**  
Develop an IEC 61131-3 Structured Text program to monitor vessel pressure, open a relief valve upon overpressure, maintain it open until safe conditions are met, and incorporate fail-safe logic for sensor/valve faults, ensuring operational safety.  

*(Key focus: Pressure monitoring, threshold-based valve control, fault handling, and latching behavior for safe reset.)*

### Prompt:
**Interlock Pressure Relief:**

Develop a self-contained IEC 61131-3 Structured Text program to implement an interlock system for opening a pressure relief valve in a vessel upon detecting overpressure. The program should monitor the vessel pressure using a pressure sensor and trigger the opening of the relief valve when the pressure exceeds a predefined safe limit.

The logic should ensure that the pressure relief valve remains open until the vessel pressure drops below a safe threshold. Additionally, incorporate safety checks to account for sensor failures or valve malfunctions, ensuring that the system defaults to a safe state in the event of a fault. Discuss the significance of pressure relief systems in protecting industrial processes from overpressure hazards and ensuring operational safety.

ðŸŸ© T (Task) â€“ What You Need to Do

Create a self-contained Structured Text program that automatically opens a pressure relief valve when the vesselâ€™s pressure exceeds a safe limit. The system should:
	â€¢	Monitor pressure via a pressure transmitter (PT)
	â€¢	Open the relief valve if pressure exceeds a defined high limit (e.g., 15 bar)
	â€¢	Keep the valve open until pressure drops below a reset threshold (e.g., 12 bar)
	â€¢	Include fail-safe conditions to:
	â€¢	Open the valve if the sensor fails or provides an invalid signal
	â€¢	Open the valve or raise an alert if the valve itself fails to actuate
	â€¢	Prevent automatic closure of the valve until conditions are verified to be safe

Also, briefly explain how such interlocks are critical for preventing overpressure incidents, protecting equipment, and ensuring operational safety.

	â€¢	A well-structured IEC 61131-3 ST code block with:
	â€¢	Pressure monitoring
	â€¢	Threshold-based valve control
	â€¢	Fault detection logic
	â€¢	Latching behavior for controlled reset
	â€¢	Clear variable declarations (e.g., PT_101, RELIEF_VALVE, SensorFault, ValveFault)
	â€¢	Inline comments for clarity and maintenance
	â€¢	A short explanation of the safety benefits of automated pressure relief interlocks

**IEC 61131-3 Structured Text Program for Interlock Pressure Relief:**

```structuredtext
// Define variables
VAR
    PT_101 : REAL; // Pressure Transmitter 101
    RELIEF_VALVE : BOOL; // Relief Valve Status
    SensorFault : BOOL; // Sensor Fault Flag
    ValveFault : BOOL; // Valve Fault Flag
    SafePressure : REAL := 12.0; // Safe Pressure Threshold
    HighPressure : REAL := 15.0; // High Pressure Threshold
END_VAR

// Main program logic
PROGRAM InterlockPressureRelief
    // Initialize variables
    SensorFault := FALSE;
    ValveFault := FALSE;
    RELIEF_VALVE := FALSE;

    // Monitor pressure
    PT_101 := ReadPressureTransmitter(101);

    // Check for sensor fault
    IF PT_101 < 0.0 OR PT_101 > 20.0 THEN
        SensorFault := TRUE;
    END_IF

    // Check for valve fault
    IF NOT ValveActuated(RELIEF_VALVE) THEN
        ValveFault := TRUE;
    END_IF

    // Open relief valve if pressure exceeds high limit or sensor/valve fault
    IF PT_101 > HighPressure OR SensorFault OR ValveFault THEN
        RELIEF_VALVE := TRUE;
    END_IF

    // Keep valve open until pressure drops below safe threshold
    IF PT_101 < SafePressure THEN
        RELIEF_VALVE := FALSE;
    END_IF

    // Reset fault flags if valve is closed and pressure is safe
    IF NOT RELIEF_VALVE AND PT_101 < SafePressure THEN
        SensorFault := FALSE;
        ValveFault := FALSE;
    END_IF
END_PROGRAM
```

**Explanation:**

This IEC 61131-3 Structured Text program monitors the pressure in a vessel using a pressure transmitter (PT_101). It checks for sensor and valve faults and opens the relief valve (RELIEF_VALVE) if the pressure exceeds a high limit (HighPressure) or if there is a sensor or valve fault. The relief valve remains open until the pressure drops below a safe threshold (SafePressure). If the valve is closed and the pressure is safe, the fault flags are reset.
