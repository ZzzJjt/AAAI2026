ðŸŸ© I (Input) â€“ What Youâ€™re Given

You need to design a function block that:
	â€¢	Accepts a 10Ã—10 REAL matrix as input
	â€¢	Computes and outputs the eigenvalues in a 10-element REAL array
	â€¢	Includes comments explaining the algorithm steps (e.g., normalization, iteration, convergence check)

	â€¢	Numerical stability (e.g., rounding errors, floating-point limits)
	â€¢	Convergence of iterative algorithms
	â€¢	Execution time and performance in PLC environments

ðŸŸ§ S (Steps) â€“ What You Need to Do
	1.	Choose an appropriate algorithm (e.g., Power Iteration or a simplified QR method) suited for a PLCâ€™s processing capabilities
	2.	Create a function block structure with:
	â€¢	Matrix input: MatrixInput : ARRAY[1..10, 1..10] OF REAL
	â€¢	Eigenvalue output: EigenValues : ARRAY[1..10] OF REAL
	3.	Implement the core logic:
	â€¢	Initialize a vector
	â€¢	Perform matrix-vector multiplication
	â€¢	Normalize the vector
	â€¢	Estimate the dominant eigenvalue
	â€¢	Repeat with convergence threshold or iteration limit
	4.	Include detailed inline comments explaining:
	â€¢	Each stepâ€™s mathematical purpose
	â€¢	How you ensure convergence
	â€¢	How fail-safes are built in for real-time performance
	5.	Optionally: create a fallback output or diagnostic flag if the algorithm doesnâ€™t converge within a safe number of cycles

ðŸŸ¦ E (Expectation) â€“ What Success Looks Like

You produce a modular, well-documented function block that can be integrated into PLC projects needing matrix analysisâ€”especially useful in model-based control, signal processing, or system diagnostics. The function block:
	â€¢	Provides reasonably accurate eigenvalues under PLC constraints
	â€¢	Performs reliably within execution cycle time limits
	â€¢	Fails safely and predictably if it detects instability or divergence

ðŸŸ¨ S (Solution) â€“ How to Get There

1. **Choose an Algorithm:**
	â€¢	Consider the Power Iteration method, which is simple and efficient for PLCs. It iteratively improves an initial vector to find the dominant eigenvalue.
	â€¢	Alternatively, a simplified QR method could be used, which decomposes the matrix into orthogonal and triangular matrices, but it may be more complex to implement.

2. **Create the Function Block:**
	â€¢	Define the input and output variables:
		- MatrixInput: 10x10 REAL array
		- EigenValues: 10 REAL array
	â€¢	Define the function block structure, including the algorithm steps and any necessary variables.

3. **Implement the Core Logic:**
	â€¢	Initialize a vector (e.g., set to all ones)
	â€¢	Perform matrix-vector multiplication
	â€¢	Normalize the vector
	â€¢	Estimate the dominant eigenvalue
	â€¢	Repeat with convergence threshold or iteration limit

4. **Include Detailed Comments:**
	â€¢	Explain each step's mathematical purpose
	â€¢	Describe how you ensure convergence (e.g., using a convergence threshold or iteration limit)
	â€¢	Detail how fail-safes are built in for real-time performance (e.g., by monitoring execution time or using a fallback output)

5. **Test and Refine:**
	â€¢	Test the function block with various input matrices
	â€¢	Refine the algorithm or implementation as needed to meet performance and accuracy requirements

6. **Documentation:**
	â€¢	Provide a clear, concise description of the function block's purpose and usage
	â€¢	Include a list of input and output variables with their data types and descriptions
	â€¢	Provide a step-by-step explanation of the algorithm, including mathematical formulas and comments on each step
	â€¢	Include any limitations or assumptions about the function block's performance or accuracy
	â€¢	Provide examples of how to use the function block in a PLC program

7. **Review and Iterate:**
	â€¢	Review the function block with colleagues or subject matter experts to ensure accuracy and clarity
