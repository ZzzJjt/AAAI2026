### Intent:
The task is to implement a Model Predictive Control (MPC) algorithm in C++ to optimize an HVAC system's energy efficiency while maintaining temperature and humidity comfort levels under dynamic environmental conditions.

### Prompt:
**Model Predictive Control for HVAC System Optimization Using C++:**

Develop C++ code to implement a model predictive control (MPC) algorithm for optimizing the performance of a Heating, Ventilation, and Air Conditioning (HVAC) system. The control system should manage temperature, humidity, and energy consumption while maintaining occupant comfort. It must consider dynamic constraints such as varying external temperatures, occupancy levels, and energy efficiency requirements, ensuring optimal control under changing environmental conditions.

Implement C++ code to simulate the HVAC systemâ€™s dynamics, and demonstrate how MPC can optimize energy usage, response time, and system performance while adhering to operational constraints.
