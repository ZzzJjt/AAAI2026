### Intent:
"Create a reusable IEC 61131-3 structured text function block that converts Fahrenheit to Celsius with input validation and status flagging for industrial PLC applications."

### Prompt:
**Fahrenheit to Celsius:**
Implement a self-contained function block in IEC 61131-3 structured text to convert Fahrenheit to Celsius. Ensure it handles input validation and provides accurate results.

**C-A-R-E:**

ðŸŸ¥ C (Context) â€“ Background Situation

Temperature conversion between Fahrenheit and Celsius is frequently needed in industrial control systemsâ€”especially in HVAC, process heating, and international deployments. Relying on manual calculations or repeated code snippets can lead to inconsistencies, rounding errors, and logic duplication. A dedicated, reusable Structured Text function block ensures accuracy, validation, and consistent integration into PLC programs.

ðŸŸ© A (Action) â€“ Task to Perform

Create a self-contained function block in IEC 61131-3 Structured Text that:
	â€¢	Accepts a temperature input in Fahrenheit
	â€¢	Converts the value to Celsius using the formula:
 C = (F - 32) \times \frac{5}{9}
	â€¢	Performs input validation, such as checking that the input is not below absolute zero (âˆ’459.67Â°F)
	â€¢	Outputs the result in Celsius, along with a ValidInput boolean status flag
	â€¢	Includes clear comments, modular structure, and scan-cycle-safe logic

â¸»

ðŸŸ¨ R (Result) â€“ Expected Outcome

The outcome should be a modular and reliable function block that can be reused in any program requiring Fahrenheit-to-Celsius conversion. It will offer:
	â€¢	Accurate results using real data types
	â€¢	Built-in validation to protect against invalid sensor readings
	â€¢	Clean, maintainable code suitable for both educational and production PLC applications

ðŸŸ¦ E (Example) â€“ Concrete Illustration

Example logic inside the function block:
IF Fahrenheit >= -459.67 THEN
   Celsius := (Fahrenheit - 32.0) * 5.0 / 9.0;
   ValidInput := TRUE;
ELSE
   Celsius := 0.0;
   ValidInput := FALSE;
END_IF;
Inputs:
	â€¢	Fahrenheit : REAL

Outputs:
	â€¢	Celsius : REAL
	â€¢	ValidInput : BOOL

**C-A-R-E:**

ðŸŸ¥ C (Context) â€“ Background Situation

In industrial automation, especially in HVAC systems, temperature control is critical. However, many systems use Fahrenheit for input while requiring Celsius for control logic. Without a standardized function block, engineers often resort to manual calculations or repetitive code snippets, which can lead to inconsistencies, rounding errors, and poor maintainability.

ðŸŸ© A (Action) â€“ Task to Perform

Develop a self-contained function block in IEC 61131-3 Structured Text to convert Fahrenheit to Celsius. Ensure the function block:
	â€¢	Accepts a Fahrenheit input
	â€¢	Converts the value using the formula C = (F - 32) \times \frac{5}{9}
	â€¢	Includes input validation to reject values below absolute zero (âˆ’459.67Â°F)
	â€¢	Outputs both the Celsius result and a boolean flag indicating whether the input was valid
	â€¢	Is scan-cycle-safe and modular for reuse in various control applications
	â€¢	Includes detailed comments explaining the logic and usage

ðŸŸ¨ R (Result) â€“ Expected Outcome

The result should be a reusable function block that:
	â€¢	Accurately converts Fahrenheit to Celsius
	â€¢	Ensures input values are within a valid range
	â€¢	Works efficiently within the scan-cycle of a PLC
	â€¢	Is easy to integrate into control logic for temperature regulation
	â€¢	Helps maintain code consistency and reduce errors in industrial systems

	â€¢	Input: Fahrenheit := 77.0
	â€¢	Process: C := (Fahrenheit - 32.0) \times \frac{5}{9}
	â€¢	Output: Celsius := 25.0, ValidInput := TRUE
	â€¢	Explanation: The function block converts 77Â°F to 25Â°C and sets the valid input flag to TRUE, indicating that the conversion was performed on a valid input.

	â€¢	Input: Fahrenheit := -500.0
	â€¢	Process: The function block detects that the input is below absolute zero and sets Celsius to 0.0, while setting ValidInput to FALSE.
	â€¢	Output: Celsius := 0.0, ValidInput := FALSE
