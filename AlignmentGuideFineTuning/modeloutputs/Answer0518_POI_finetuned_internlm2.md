ðŸŸ© I (Input) â€“ What Youâ€™re Given

You need to implement a function block that calculates the Poisson distribution probability, given:

    Probability := EXP(-Lambda) * POW(Lambda, K) / Factorial;
ELSE
    Probability := 0.0;
END_IF;
	4.	Add inline comments explaining:

	â€¢	Can be reused in use cases such as:
	â€¢	Predicting machine failure rates
	â€¢	Sensor event tracking over time intervals

ðŸŸ¥ P (Process) â€“ What You Did

I created a self-contained function block in IEC 61131-3 Structured Text to compute the Poisson distribution probability. The function block, named PoissonProbability, takes two inputs: Lambda, the expected number of events (mean rate), and K, the number of actual events observed. The output is the probability that K events occur given a rate Lambda.

To calculate the factorial for K, I used a loop to multiply the values from 1 to K. This is necessary because there is no built-in factorial function in Structured Text. I then computed the Poisson probability using the exponential and power functions, ensuring that the input values are within the valid range (Lambda > 0 and K â‰¥ 0).

I added inline comments to explain each step of the Poisson formula, the manual computation of the factorial, and the impact of floating-point math on precision. I also discussed the importance of handling edge cases to prevent overflow and ensure the function block can be used in real-time event monitoring applications.
