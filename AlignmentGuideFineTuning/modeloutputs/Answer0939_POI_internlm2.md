### Intent:
**Intent Summary:**  
Create a Structured Text program that maintains a 2:1 flow ratio between two reactants (A and B) with safety checks, emergency stop handling, and alarm management for an industrial mixing process.

### Prompt:
**Programming Reference:**
Compile a comprehensive list of all valid keywords used in the IEC 61131-3 Structured Text programming language, ensuring that it covers both standard control flow structures and data types. Include examples of usage for key functions where applicable.

**T-A-G:**

游린 T (Task)

Create a programming reference for the IEC 61131-3 Structured Text (ST) language by compiling a complete list of valid keywords.

游릴 A (Action)

Gather and categorize all official keywords specified in the IEC 61131-3 standard, including control flow structures (such as IF, CASE, FOR), standard functions (TON, CTU, ABS), and data types (INT, REAL, BOOL). Include concise usage examples or code snippets to illustrate how key functions and structures are typically used in automation programming.

游릱 G (Goal)

Deliver a well-organized, easy-to-use reference guide that supports engineers and developers in writing correct, efficient, and standards-compliant Structured Text code for industrial control systems.

Deliver a well-organized, easy-to-use reference guide that supports engineers and developers in writing correct, efficient, and standards-compliant Structured Text code for industrial control systems. The guide should be comprehensive, accurate, and up-to-date, reflecting the latest version of the IEC 61131-3 standard.

**Purpose:**

The purpose of this task is to create a comprehensive programming reference for the IEC 61131-3 Structured Text language. This reference will serve as a valuable resource for engineers and developers working with automation systems, providing them with a complete list of valid keywords, along with examples of usage for key functions and structures.

**Scope:**

The scope of this task includes all official keywords specified in the IEC 61131-3 standard, including control flow structures, standard functions, and data types. The reference guide will cover both standard control flow structures (such as IF, CASE, FOR) and standard functions (TON, CTU, ABS), as well as data types (INT, REAL, BOOL). The guide will be organized in a way that is easy to use and understand, with concise usage examples or code snippets provided for key functions and structures.

**Deliverables:**

The deliverables for this task will be a well-organized, easy-to-use reference guide for the IEC 61131-3 Structured Text language. The guide will be comprehensive, accurate, and up-to-date, reflecting the latest version of the IEC 61131-3 standard. It will include a complete list of valid keywords, along with examples of usage for key functions and structures. The guide will be presented in a clear and concise manner, making it accessible to engineers and developers working with automation systems.

**Timeline:**

The timeline for this task will be as follows:

1. Research and gather information on the IEC 61131-3 standard and its keywords (1 week).
2. Categorize and compile the list of valid keywords, including control flow structures, standard functions, and data types (2 weeks).
3. Develop concise usage examples or code snippets for key functions and structures (2 weeks).
4. Organize and format the reference guide (1 week).
5. Review and finalize the guide (1 week).

**Resources:**

The resources required for this task include access to the IEC 61131-3 standard, programming tools and environments, and relevant documentation. Additionally, the team will need to have a strong understanding of the IEC 61131-3 standard and experience with Structured Text programming.

**Risks:**

The main risk associated with this task is the potential for incomplete or inaccurate information
