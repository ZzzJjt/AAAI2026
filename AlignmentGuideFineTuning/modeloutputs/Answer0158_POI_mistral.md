### Intent:
**Intent Summary:**  
Develop an IEC 61131-3 Structured Text program to automate the controlled shutdown of a steel production facility, including gradual furnace temperature reduction, gas flow ramping over 12 hours, and dynamic oxygen adjustment to maintain a 1:2.5 fuel-to-air ratio, with safety interlocks and modular logic for sequencing.

### Prompt:
**Shutdown Steel Production:**

Develop a comprehensive list of steps for the controlled shutdown of a steel production facility. Include key stages such as reducing furnace temperature, controlling gas flow rates, and maintaining safe oxygen levels throughout the shutdown process.

Provide a detailed control narrative for steps 4 to 6 of the shutdown sequence, specifying concrete ranges and setpoints for variables such as temperature, gas flow, and oxygen levels.

Write a self-contained IEC 61131-3 Structured Text program based on this control narrative, ensuring proper sequencing and safety protocols.

Additionally, create a function in IEC 61131-3 to gradually reduce the fuel gas flow rate to the furnace burners over a period of 12 hours. This function should incorporate timing and safety checks to ensure smooth transitions.

Lastly, write an IEC 61131-3 function for adjusting the oxygen supply to the burners to maintain a precise fuel-to-air ratio of 1:2.5 during the shutdown. Ensure the function is adaptable to fluctuations in gas flow and temperature, and include safeguards for maintaining combustion efficiency.

**B-A-B:**

ðŸŸ¥ B (Before) â€“ The Problem or Challenge

A steel production facility shutdown involves highly sensitive processes such as gradually lowering furnace temperatures, controlling combustible gas flow, and maintaining oxygen levels to prevent combustion instability and safety hazards. Without structured sequencing and parameter monitoring, the shutdown can result in thermal stress on equipment, unsafe gas conditions, or violations of emissions and process safety standards. Many shutdowns also lack modular, scalable control logic that is easy to test, modify, and deploy within IEC 61131-3 environments.

Develop a comprehensive, structured IEC 61131-3 batch shutdown program for a steel plant that ensures controlled deactivation of the facility. This includes:
	â€¢	A step-by-step shutdown plan, including reducing furnace temperature, ramping down fuel gas flow, and adjusting oxygen to maintain a 1:2.5 fuel-to-air ratio.
	â€¢	A detailed control narrative for steps 4 to 6, with clearly defined temperature, gas flow, and oxygen setpoints.
	â€¢	A modular Structured Text program that executes each stage in a safe and timely sequence.
	â€¢	A function block that reduces gas flow over 12 hours, incorporating timing logic and safety interlocks.
	â€¢	A second function to adjust oxygen supply dynamically based on gas flow and furnace temperature to maintain combustion efficiency and stability.

ðŸŸ§ B (Bridge) â€“ How to Get There
	1.	Begin by defining the shutdown stages, annotating each with expected sensor inputs and actuator outputs.
	2.	Translate steps 4 to 6 of the shutdown into structured logic using IEC 61131-3 control elements like IF, CASE, TON, and PID blocks if needed.
	3.	Create a gas flow ramp-down function, using elapsed time and flow rate deltas, with fault checks for abnormal drops or interruptions.
	4.	Implement an oxygen control function that reads real-time gas flow, multiplies it by 2.5, and modulates oxygen valves accordingly, with alarms for deviation limits.
	5.	Integrate all logic into a sequential execution framework, with safety-first transitions and clear operator feedback (e.g., HMI tags or status flags).
	6.	Include robust comments and diagnostics for testing, maintenance, and troubleshooting during real-world deployment.

**Control Narrative:**

**Step 4: Gas Flow Reduction**

1.	Set a 12-hour timer (T_12h) to initiate the gas flow reduction sequence.
2.	Calculate the initial gas flow rate (F_gas_init) from the current value (F_gas_current).
3.	Calculate the target gas flow rate (F_gas_target) as a percentage of the initial flow rate (F_gas_init) based on the elapsed time (T_elapsed) since T_12h started.
4.	If T_elapsed < 12 hours, calculate the flow rate delta (Î”F_gas) as (F_gas_target - F_gas_current) / T_elapsed.
5.	If T_elapsed >= 12 hours, set Î”F_gas to 0.
6.	Update the gas flow rate (F_gas_current) by adding Î”F_gas to the current flow rate.
7.	Check if F_gas_current is within acceptable limits (e.g., 10% of the initial flow rate). If not, trigger an alarm and halt the shutdown process.
8.	Repeat steps 4 to 7 until the gas flow rate reaches 0.

**Step 5: Oxygen Adjustment**

1.	Read the current gas flow rate (F_gas_current).
2.	Calculate the target oxygen flow rate (F_oxygen_target) as 2.5 times the current gas flow rate (F_gas_current).
3.	Read the current oxygen flow rate (F_oxygen_current).
4.	Calculate the oxygen flow rate delta (Î”F_oxygen) as (F_oxygen_target - F_oxygen_current).
5.	Update the oxygen flow rate (F_oxygen_current) by adding Î”F_oxygen to the current oxygen flow rate.
6.	Check if F_oxygen_current is within acceptable limits (e.g., 10% of F_oxygen_target). If not, trigger an alarm and halt the shutdown process.
7.	Repeat steps 4 to 6 until the oxygen flow rate reaches the
