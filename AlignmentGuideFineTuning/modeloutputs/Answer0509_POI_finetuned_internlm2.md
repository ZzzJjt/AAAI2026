üü© I (Input) ‚Äì What You‚Äôre Given

You need to build a function block that:
	‚Ä¢	Accepts an input:
	‚Ä¢	AngleRad : REAL ‚Äî the input angle in radians
	‚Ä¢	Returns an output:
	‚Ä¢	SineValue : REAL ‚Äî the calculated sine of the angle
	‚Ä¢	Should work even in systems that do not support built-in SIN()
	‚Ä¢	Must execute efficiently within a PLC scan cycle and handle rounding/precision issues appropriately

‚∏ª

üüß S (Steps) ‚Äì What You Need to Do
	1.	Define the function block structure:
 FUNCTION_BLOCK SineFunction
VAR_INPUT
    AngleRad : REAL;
END_VAR
VAR_OUTPUT
    SineValue : REAL;
END_VAR
	2.	Implement the core logic using one of two approaches:
	‚Ä¢	If the platform supports it:
 SineValue := SIN(AngleRad);
 ‚Ä¢	If not, use a Taylor series approximation:
 VAR
    x, x2, x3, x5, x7 : REAL;
END_VAR
x := AngleRad;
x2 := x * x;
x3 := x2 * x;
x5 := x3 * x2;
x7 := x5 * x2;
SineValue := x - (x3 / 6.0) + (x5 / 120.0) - (x7 / 5040.0);
3.	Add inline comments:
	‚Ä¢	State the formula used and assumptions (e.g., radians, approximation terms)
	‚Ä¢	Note that the series works best near 0 and may require input normalization
	‚Ä¢	Warn of performance/accuracy trade-offs in long-running loops or real-time control
	4.	Optional: Normalize large angles to the range [-œÄ, œÄ] to improve accuracy

	‚Ä¢	Simulated waveforms
	‚Ä¢	Robot trajectory smoothing
	‚Ä¢	Runs predictably within scan time constraints
	‚Ä¢	Includes clear documentation, making it easy for others to understand, modify, and extend
