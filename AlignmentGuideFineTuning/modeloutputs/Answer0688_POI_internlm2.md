### Intent:
**Intent Summary:**  
Create a text-based Process Flow Diagram (PFD) for penicillin fermentation, detailing unit operations, instrumentation (e.g., sensors, valves), and control strategies (e.g., PID loops, dosing) to guide process design and automation.  

*(For code generation: Generate a structured textual PFD with tagged instruments, material flows, and control logic for penicillin production.)*

**R-I-S-E:**

ðŸŸ¥ R (Role) â€“ Define Your Role

Act as a bioprocess engineer responsible for documenting the penicillin fermentation process using a structured, text-based Process Flow Diagram (PFD) format suitable for engineering design, control system integration, or early-stage collaboration.

ðŸŸ© I (Input) â€“ Information Provided

You need to create a textual PFD that outlines the core process units, instrumentation, and control strategy for a penicillin fermentation process. The PFD should:
	â€¢	Describe major unit operations (e.g., water tank, nutrient mixer, sterilizer, fermenter, separator, product tank)
	â€¢	Use arrows (-->) to show the flow of materials
	â€¢	Include instrument tags (e.g., TT101, pH201, FCV301) for measurement and control
	â€¢	Describe how parameters like temperature, pH, and agitation are managed through control loops or manual control

â¸»

ðŸŸ§ S (Steps) â€“ Steps to Perform
	1.	List the main process equipment in the order of operation.
	2.	Connect units using arrows to indicate material flow.
	3.	For each unit, specify key instrumentation, such as:
	â€¢	Temperature transmitters and controllers (TT â†’ TIC â†’ Valve)
	â€¢	pH probes and dosing pumps
	â€¢	Level and flow indicators
	4.	Include a brief description of the control strategy per unit (e.g., PID control loop, manual override, or safety interlocks).
	5.	Format the information clearly using consistent indentation and tagging.

ðŸŸ¦ E (Expectation) â€“ Expected Outcome

Deliver a readable, text-based PFD that accurately reflects the process sequence, instrumentation, and control philosophy for penicillin production. This document will support:
	â€¢	Process design and review
	â€¢	PLC/DCS configuration
	â€¢	Control narrative development
	â€¢	Communication across engineering and automation teams

ðŸŸ¨ S (Safety) â€“ Safety Considerations

Ensure that the PFD includes safety considerations, such as emergency shut-off valves, pressure relief valves, and interlocks to prevent over-pressurization or overheating.

â¸»

ðŸŸ© C (Communication) â€“ Communication

Your PFD should be clear, concise, and well-structured to facilitate communication between process engineers, automation engineers, and other stakeholders involved in the design and operation of the penicillin fermentation process.

â¸»

ðŸŸ§ A (Assistance) â€“ Assistance Available

If you need assistance with specific aspects of the PFD, such as instrumentation selection, control loop tuning, or safety considerations, you can ask for help from the community. However, the primary goal is to create a self-contained, text-based PFD that can be easily understood and implemented by the team.

ðŸŸ¥ T (Tips) â€“ Tips for Success

1.	Use consistent tagging and formatting for instruments and control loops.
2.	Include a brief description of each control loop, including the setpoint, range, and tuning parameters.
3.	Consider the impact of process variables on each other and how they are managed through control loops.
4.	Ensure that safety considerations are clearly identified and integrated into the PFD.
5.	Proofread your PFD for clarity, consistency, and completeness before sharing it with the team.

Here's a sample text-based PFD for penicillin fermentation:

```
Penicillin Fermentation Process Flow Diagram

Water Tank ---> TT101 ---> TIC ---> FCV301 ---> Nutrient Mixer ---> TT102 ---> TIC ---> FCV302 ---> Sterilizer ---> TT103 ---> TIC ---> FCV303 ---> Fermenter ---> TT104 ---> TIC ---> FCV304 ---> Separator ---> TT105 ---> TIC ---> FCV305 ---> Product Tank

Control Strategy:
- TT101: Maintain temperature at 30Â°C with PID control loop (setpoint Â± 0.5Â°C)
- TT102: Maintain pH at 7.0 with PID control loop (setpoint Â± 0.1)
- TT103:
