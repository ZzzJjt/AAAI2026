### Intent:
**Intent Summary:**  
Design a distillation column's safety interlock system by creating a textual P&I diagram and implementing IEC 61131-3 Structured Text logic to monitor and control critical parameters (pressure, temperature, level) with predefined thresholds, ensuring safe operation through automated protective actions.

### Prompt:
**Interlock Distillation Column:**

Develop a P&I diagram in textual notation for a distillation column, detailing the process equipment, instrumentation, control functions, safety interlocks, and piping. Use typical tagnames to represent elements such as the column (C-101), reboiler (E-101), condenser (E-102), level transmitters (LT-101), pressure transmitters (PT-101), and control valves (FV-101). Ensure the notation includes both the control functions and the safety interlocks, specifying their interactions with the piping and instrumentation system.

Following this, write a self-contained IEC 61131-3 Structured Text program to implement the interlocks of the distillation column. Include high and low limits for critical parameters such as pressure, temperature, and liquid level. For instance, trigger the pressure relief valve if the column pressure exceeds 120 psi (high limit) or shut off the feed valve if the pressure drops below 50 psi (low limit). Similarly, close the reboiler heat supply if the temperature exceeds 180Â°C. Discuss the role of interlocks in maintaining safe operating conditions within the distillation process.

	1.	Develop a P&I diagram in textual notation, listing all relevant elements such as the column, reboiler, condenser, transmitters, and control valves. Use tagnames to represent each component.
	2.	Implement the interlock logic in Structured Text, ensuring that the program triggers protective actions when critical parameters exceed predefined limits. For example, if the pressure exceeds a high threshold, the pressure relief valve should open. If the pressure drops below a low threshold, the feed valve should close.
	3.	Explain the importance of interlocks in maintaining safe operation, focusing on how they prevent hazardous conditions such as overpressure, underpressure, or extreme temperature deviations.
