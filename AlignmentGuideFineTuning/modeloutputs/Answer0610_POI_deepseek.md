### Intent:
**Intent Summary:**  
Translate a Structured Text (ST) program for a pick-and-place system with manual/auto mode control into Instruction List (IL) while preserving logic for button inputs, conveyor/arm actuation, mode switching, and timed operations.  

*(Focus: IL conversion of ST logic for hardware compatibility, maintaining functional equivalence.)*

### Prompt:
**Translate ST To Instruction List:**

Translate the following 61131-3 Structured Text program to 61131-3 Instruction List: PROGRAM PickAndPlace VAR ManualButton : BOOL; // Input signal for manual mode AutoButton : BOOL; // Input signal for auto mode ClipButton : BOOL; // Input signal for clip action TransferButton : BOOL; // Input signal for transfer action ReleaseButton : BOOL; // Input signal for release action ConveyorA : BOOL; // Input signal for presence of product on conveyor A ConveyorB : BOOL; // Output signal to control conveyor B RoboticArm : BOOL; // Output signal to control the robotic arm Mode : INT := 0; // Internal variable to store the current mode (0 = manual, 1 = auto) AutoProcess : BOOL := FALSE; // Internal variable to store whether the auto control process is currently running END_VAR

// Manual mode control process IF ManualButton THEN Mode := 0; // Set mode to manual END_IF

IF Mode = 0 THEN // Manual mode IF ClipButton AND ConveyorA THEN RoboticArm := TRUE; // Clip the product ELSIF TransferButton THEN ConveyorB := TRUE; // Transfer the product to conveyor B ELSIF ReleaseButton THEN ConveyorB := FALSE; // Release the product from conveyor B END_IF END_IF

// Auto mode control process IF AutoButton THEN Mode := 1; // Set mode to auto END_IF

IF Mode = 1 THEN // Auto mode IF NOT AutoProcess AND ConveyorA THEN // Only start the process if not currently running and there is a product on conveyor A AutoProcess := TRUE; // Set flag to indicate that the auto process is running RoboticArm := TRUE; // Clip the product WAIT 2; // Wait for 2 seconds to transfer the product ConveyorB := TRUE; // Transfer the product to conveyor B END_IF IF ConveyorB AND NOT ConveyorA THEN // Release the product from conveyor B once it has been transferred and there is no product on conveyor A ConveyorB := FALSE; AutoProcess := FALSE; // Clear the flag to indicate that the auto process is not running END_IF END_IF

ðŸŸ¥ R (Role) â€“ Define Your Role

Act as a PLC programmer experienced in IEC 61131-3 standards, tasked with translating Structured Text (ST) programs into Instruction List (IL) for use on legacy or IL-compatible PLC hardware.

ðŸŸ© I (Input) â€“ Information Provided

You are given a Structured Text program called PickAndPlace, which includes variable declarations and control logic for manual and automatic modes. The logic involves user input buttons, actuator control signals, mode switching using an integer flag (Mode), and conditional logic blocks with timing behavior (WAIT).

ðŸŸ§ S (Steps) â€“ Steps to Perform
	1.	Parse the ST code and identify key logic structures such as IF, ELSIF, variable assignments, and mode checks.
	2.	Convert each logic block into its equivalent IL form using IL instructions like LD, ST, AND, JMPC, and JMP, and label-based control flow.
	3.	Implement timing behavior (e.g., WAIT 2) using available IL constructs or simulated delay mechanisms (such as timers or counters).
	4.	Ensure variable states, logic conditions, and transitions are faithfully represented in IL with the same functional behavior as in ST.

ðŸŸ¦ E (Expectation) â€“ Expected Output

Deliver a complete, syntactically correct IL version of the PickAndPlace ST program that preserves all logic and operational behavior, including manual/auto mode switching, robotic arm and conveyor control, and state handling. The IL code should be ready for execution on any IEC 61131-3-compliant IL interpreter or runtime.

ðŸŸ¨ I (Instructions) â€“ Steps to Follow

1.	Create a new IL program with the same name as the ST program (PickAndPlace).
2.	Initialize the same variables as in the ST program (ManualButton, AutoButton, ClipButton, TransferButton, ReleaseButton, ConveyorA, ConveyorB, and RoboticArm).
3.	Add a new variable, ModeIL, to represent the IL version of the Mode variable.
4.	Add a new variable, AutoProcessIL, to represent the IL version of the AutoProcess variable.
5.	Add a new variable, WaitCounterIL, to represent the IL version of the WAIT 2 timing behavior.
6.	Add a new variable, ILInstructionCounter, to keep track of the number of IL instructions executed.
7.	Copy the logic from the ST program and translate it into IL instructions, using the steps below as a guide:

a.	IF statements: Use JMPC (Jump to Conditional) and JMP (Jump) instructions to implement the same conditional behavior as in ST.

b.	Variable assignments: Use LD (Load) instructions to assign values to variables.

c.	Mode checks: Use comparisons between variables and constants to implement the same logic as in ST.

d.	Timing behavior: Use WAIT instructions or simulated delay mechanisms (e.g., timers or counters) to implement the WAIT 2 behavior.

e.	Control logic: Use AND (AND) instructions to implement the AND logic in ST.

f.	User input handling: Use the appropriate IL instructions to handle user input signals (e.g., TransferButton) and update the corresponding variables (e.g., ConveyorB).

8.	Ensure that the IL program preserves the same functional behavior as the ST program, including manual/auto mode switching, robotic arm and conveyor control, and state handling.
9.	Test the IL program on a compatible PLC hardware to ensure it executes correctly and preserves the same functionality as the ST program.

ðŸŸ© E (Expected Output) â€“ Expected Result

A complete, syntactically correct Instruction List (IL) program called PickAndPlaceIL that faithfully represents the logic and behavior of the original Structured Text (ST) program. The IL program should be ready for execution on any IEC 61131-3-compliant IL
