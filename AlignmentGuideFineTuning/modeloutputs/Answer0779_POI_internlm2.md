### Intent:
**Intent Summary:**  
Develop an IEC 61131-3 Structured Text program to automate the safe startup of a Valmet paper machine's press section, including sequential activation of rolls/conveyors, controlled ramping of speed (up to 500 m/min), nip pressure (250 kN/m), and temperature (85â€“90Â°C), with integrated safety interlocks and synchronization logic to prevent sheet/equipment damage.  

*(Focus: Modular ST code with phased control, parameter ramping, and safety checks.)*

### Prompt:
**Startup Paper Machine:**

Develop a detailed startup sequence for the press section of a Valmet paper machine, specifying typical parameter values such as press roll speed, nip pressure, and temperature settings. The sequence should include the step-by-step activation of the press section components, ensuring proper synchronization between the rolls and conveyors, and gradually ramping up to the operational speed.

Write a self-contained IEC 61131-3 Structured Text program to control this startup sequence. The program should include logic for managing interlocks, safety checks, and smooth transitions between startup phases. Discuss the significance of maintaining optimal nip pressure and temperature throughout the process to prevent damage to the paper sheet and equipment.

**Additional Considerations:**

1. **Modularity:** Break down the startup sequence into distinct phases, each with its own control logic and safety checks. This will allow for easier maintenance and modification of the program in the future.

2. **Safety Interlocks:** Implement interlocks to prevent the press section from operating in an unsafe state. For example, a roll not reaching the correct position before activating the next roll, or a temperature sensor not reaching the desired temperature before ramping up speed.

3. **Ramp Logic:** Use appropriate ramping functions to gradually increase the speed, nip pressure, and temperature to prevent sudden stress on the equipment and paper sheet.

4. **Synchronization:** Ensure that all rolls and conveyors are synchronized during the startup sequence to prevent sheet damage or misalignment.

5. **Documentation:** Include inline comments and a separate documentation file explaining the purpose of each phase, the role of variables, and the importance of maintaining nip pressure and temperature control during startup.

**Deliverables:**

1. **Structured Text Code:** A self-contained IEC 61131-3 Structured Text program that implements the startup sequence, safety interlocks, and ramp logic.

2. **Documentation:** A separate file containing a detailed explanation of the startup sequence, safety interlocks, ramp logic, and the importance of nip pressure and temperature control during startup.

3. **Code Review:** A brief review of the code, highlighting any potential improvements or areas of concern.

**Deadline:** 7 days from the start of the project.

**Additional Resources:**

1. **Valmet Paper Machine Specifications:** Detailed technical specifications provided by Valmet for the paper machine, including dimensions, speed, and pressure ratings of the press section components.

2. **Safety Standards:** Relevant safety standards and guidelines, such as ISO 13849 and IEC 61508, to ensure the safety of the press section during startup.

3. **IEC 61131-3 Standard:** The official IEC standard for programming languages used in industrial automation, including Structured Text.

4. **Valmet Paper Machine Manuals:** Detailed manuals provided by Valmet for the paper machine, including electrical schematics, control logic, and safety interlocks.

5. **Industry Best Practices:** Industry best practices for paper machine startup sequences, ramping strategies, and safety interlocks.
