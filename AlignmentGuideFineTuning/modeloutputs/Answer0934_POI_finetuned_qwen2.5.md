// Outputs
stAmmoniaValveControl : BOOL; // TRUE to open ammonia valve
stCO2ValveControl : BOOL; // TRUE to open CO2 valve

// Internal variables
stStep1 : BOOL := FALSE; // Load raw materials

// Parameters
rTargetPressure : REAL := 175.0; // Target reactor pressure in bars

END_VAR
// Main sequence control
IF NOT stReactionFinished THEN

    // Step 1: Load raw materials
    IF NOT stStep1 THEN
        stAmmoniaValveControl := TRUE;  // Control ammonia valve
        stCO2ValveControl := TRUE;      // Control CO2 valve

        END_IF

    // Step 2: Control reaction
    ELSIF NOT stStep2 THEN
        // Check if current pressure and temperature are within the target range

END_IF

ðŸŸ¥ T (Task) â€“ What You Need to Do

Generate comprehensive developer documentation for a PLC program written in IEC 61131-3 Structured Text, named UreaReactionControl. The program automates the urea synthesis process by controlling valve operations, monitoring pressure and temperature, and ensuring proper reaction timing.

â¸»

ðŸŸ© A (Action) â€“ How You Should Approach It

To complete this task:
	1.	Summarize the programâ€™s purpose â€“ explain its role in managing the chemical reaction process in two steps: material loading and controlled reaction.
	2.	Document each variable:
	â€¢	Inputs: ammonia and COâ‚‚ valve states, current pressure and temperature
	â€¢	Outputs: control signals for ammonia and COâ‚‚ valves
	â€¢	Internals: step flags and timer
	â€¢	Parameters: pressure, temperature targets and tolerances, reaction duration
	3.	Describe the logic flow:
	â€¢	Step 1: Opens valves and waits for confirmation
	â€¢	Step 2: Monitors temperature and pressure; starts timer
	â€¢	If conditions are met and timer expires, reaction is marked complete
	4.	Highlight the use of CURRENT_TIME to track reaction duration
	5.	Format the documentation with clear sections such as:
	â€¢	Overview
	â€¢	Variable definitions
	â€¢	Sequential logic explanation
	â€¢	Control conditions and safety handling

â¸»

ðŸŸ¦ G (Goal) â€“ What You Should Achieve

The final documentation should:
	â€¢	Provide a clear, technical reference for future developers and engineers
	â€¢	Support troubleshooting and debugging by explaining internal logic
	â€¢	Serve as part of system validation or audit documentation
	â€¢	Ensure the control logic is transparent, reproducible, and maintainable
