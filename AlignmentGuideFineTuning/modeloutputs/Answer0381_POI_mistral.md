### Intent:
**Intent Summary:**  
Create a detailed control narrative for an ammonium nitrate reactor, specifying setpoints, instrumentation, operational sequences, and interlock logic to ensure safe, automated, and consistent reactor operation.  

*(For code generation: Focus on translating setpoints, PID control loops, equipment actions, and safety interlocks into programmable logic.)*

### Prompt:
**Control Narrative Beer Brewing:**

Create a control narrative for beer brewing including concrete setpoints and ranges.

Create a detailed explanation of the Lautering process (Section 4). Include the equipment and instrumentation needed. Provide a list of the steps to execute.

**C-A-R-E:**

ðŸŸ¥ C (Context) â€“ Background Situation

In beer brewing automation, a well-defined control narrative is essential for ensuring that brewing stages are executed with precision and consistency. One of the most critical stages is lautering, where wort is separated from the grain. Without a clear explanation of setpoints, instrumentation, and steps, engineers and operators may face inefficiencies, delays, or poor-quality output.

ðŸŸ© A (Action) â€“ Task to Perform

Develop a structured control narrative for the entire beer brewing process, and provide a detailed Section 4 focused on the lautering phase, including:
	â€¢	Concrete setpoints and ranges (e.g., temperature, flow, turbidity)
	â€¢	The equipment and instrumentation used during lautering
	â€¢	A step-by-step description of the lautering process logic
	â€¢	Automated control actions triggered by sensor feedback and operator input

â¸»

ðŸŸ¨ R (Result) â€“ Expected Outcome

The result should be a practical, actionable control narrative that:
	â€¢	Standardizes brewing operations for consistent beer quality
	â€¢	Provides engineering and operations teams with a shared reference
	â€¢	Includes key automation logic and instrumentation details
	â€¢	Helps integrate control systems with process equipment

Section 4: Lautering Process

Setpoints:
	â€¢	Mash rest temperature: 67â€¯Â°C
	â€¢	Lautering flow rate: 1.8â€¯L/min
	â€¢	Turbidity cut-off: < 200 NTU
	â€¢	Sparge water temperature: 76â€¯Â°C

Equipment & Instrumentation:
	â€¢	Lauter tun with rake arms and false bottom
	â€¢	Turbidity sensor at wort outlet
	â€¢	Flow transmitter on wort and sparge lines
	â€¢	Level transmitter in lauter tun
	â€¢	Motorized valve to divert cloudy wort to waste

Steps:
	1.	Begin recirculation until turbidity < 200 NTU
	2.	Start wort transfer to kettle
	3.	Begin sparging at 76â€¯Â°C while maintaining lauter tun level
	4.	Adjust rake arm position based on wort flow resistance
	5.	Stop sparging when grain bed is dry and total volume reached

	5.	Stop sparging when grain bed is dry and total volume reached
	6.	Close valve to kettle and begin boil

Automated Control Actions:
	â€¢	If turbidity > 200 NTU, divert wort to waste
	â€¢	If lauter tun level drops below 10%, start sparging
	â€¢	If lauter tun level exceeds 90%, stop sparging
	â€¢	If wort flow rate drops below 1.5â€¯L/min, adjust rake arm position
	â€¢	If wort flow rate exceeds 2.1â€¯L/min, adjust rake arm position

**Code Generation:**

For code generation, focus on translating the setpoints, PID control loops, equipment actions, and safety interlocks into programmable logic.

Here's an example of how the lautering process interlocks could be implemented in a PLC:

```
// Lautering Interlocks

// Turbidity Interlock
IF (Turbidity > 200) THEN
    DI_WortToWaste := TRUE;
END_IF;

// Lauter Tun Level Interlocks
IF (LauterTunLevel < 10) THEN
    DI_StartSparge := TRUE;
END_IF;

IF (LauterTunLevel > 90) THEN
    DI_StopSparge := TRUE;
END_IF;

// Wort Flow Rate Interlocks
IF (WortFlowRate < 1.5) THEN
    DI_AdjustRakeArm := TRUE;
END_IF;

IF (WortFlowRate > 2.1) THEN
    DI_AdjustRakeArm := TRUE;
END_IF;
```
