### Intent:
The task is to create an IEC 61131-3 structured text function block that performs a binary search on a sorted 100-element integer array, with input validation and efficient boundary handling, for reliable PLC-based data lookup in industrial control systems.

### Prompt:
**Binary Search:**
Implement a self-contained function block in IEC 61131-3 structured text to perform a binary search on an array of 100 integers. Include input validation and efficient handling of search boundaries.

**T-A-G:**

ðŸŸ¥ T (Task)

Implement a binary search function block in IEC 61131-3 Structured Text to efficiently locate a target value in a 100-element sorted integer array.

â¸»

ðŸŸ© A (Action)
	â€¢	Define a self-contained function block that accepts:
	â€¢	SearchArray : ARRAY[1..100] OF INT
	â€¢	TargetValue : INT
	â€¢	Enable : BOOL
	â€¢	Use internal variables for Low, High, Mid, and status flags.
	â€¢	Implement the binary search algorithm using a WHILE loop or equivalent, ensuring efficient narrowing of the search window.
	â€¢	Add input validation to ensure boundary safety and proper triggering.
	â€¢	Output the index of the target value and a boolean flag indicating whether it was found.
	â€¢	Include comments explaining each step of the logic for maintainability and clarity.

ðŸŸ¦ G (Goal)

Deliver a modular, efficient, and scan-cycle-safe Structured Text function block that enables fast data lookup on PLCs. The function should be reliable, easy to reuse, and support safe operation within industrial real-time control systems.

This function block accepts a sorted array of 100 integers, a target value, and an enable flag. It returns the index of the target value and a boolean flag indicating whether it was found. The binary search algorithm is implemented using a WHILE loop, ensuring efficient narrowing of the search window. Input validation is included to ensure boundary safety and proper triggering. The function is self-contained and easy to reuse in other parts of the PLC program.
