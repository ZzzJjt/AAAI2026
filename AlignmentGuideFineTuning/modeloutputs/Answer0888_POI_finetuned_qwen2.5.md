### Intent:
The task is to create an IEC 61131-3 Structured Text program for a pick-and-place robot that operates in interlocked Manual and Auto modes between two conveyors, with manual step-by-step control and automated timed sequences.  

**Intent Summary:**  
*"Develop a PLC program in ST for a dual-mode pick-and-place robot with interlocked manual/auto operation, manual command execution, and automated timed transfer sequences between two conveyors."*

### Prompt:
**Pick-and-Place Application for a Robot Using 61131-3 Structured Text:**

Write a PLC program in structured text (ST) according to IEC 61131-3 standards for a pick-and-place robotic application with two conveyors, following the process described below:

Process Description:

The system operates in two modes: Manual Mode and Auto Mode. These modes are interlocked, meaning only one can be active at any time.

	1.	Manual Mode:
	â€¢	When the Manual button is pressed, the robotic arm will execute the following steps in response to individual manual commands:
	â€¢	Clip: Clip the product from conveyor A.
	â€¢	Transfer: Move the product to conveyor B.
	â€¢	Release: Release the product onto conveyor B, allowing it to be carried away.
	2.	Auto Mode:
	â€¢	When the Auto button is pressed, the robotic arm will execute the entire pick-and-place process automatically:
	â€¢	Clip: Clip the product from conveyor A and hold it.
	â€¢	Transfer: Transfer the product to conveyor B (this action takes 2 seconds).
	â€¢	Release: Release the product onto conveyor B.
	â€¢	The auto process completes after one cycle, but can be re-triggered by pressing the Auto button again.

The system should ensure that manual and auto modes cannot operate simultaneously, using interlocking logic to prevent conflicts between the two modes.

**T-A-G:**

ðŸŸ¥ T (Task) â€“ What You Need to Do

Write a self-contained IEC 61131-3 Structured Text (ST) program for a pick-and-place robot that operates between two conveyors. The system must support both Manual Mode and Auto Mode, with interlocking to ensure only one mode is active at a time. The robot should respond to direct commands in Manual Mode and execute a full sequence in Auto Mode.

ðŸŸ© A (Action) â€“ How to Do It
	1.	Set Up Mode Control:
	â€¢	Use BtnManual and BtnAuto to toggle ManualMode and AutoMode.
	â€¢	Ensure that activating one mode deactivates the other (mutual interlock).
	2.	Implement Manual Mode:
	â€¢	If ManualMode is active, respond to individual commands:
	â€¢	CmdClip: Clip a product from Conveyor A
	â€¢	CmdTransfer: Transfer the product to Conveyor B
	â€¢	CmdRelease: Release the product onto Conveyor B
	â€¢	Actions are performed one at a time with no sequence logic.
	3.	Implement Auto Mode:
	â€¢	If AutoMode is active and BtnAuto is pressed:
	â€¢	Trigger a full sequence: Clip â†’ wait 2 seconds â†’ Release
	â€¢	Use a state machine (State variable) and a TON timer for the 2-second delay
	â€¢	Auto sequence should run once per button press and reset after completion
	4.	Reset State and clear triggers to ensure readiness for the next cycle

ðŸŸ¦ G (Goal) â€“ What You Want to Achieve

Develop a program that ensures:
	â€¢	Safe and conflict-free operation between Manual and Auto Modes
	â€¢	Precise manual control for setup, testing, or maintenance
	â€¢	Automated, time-coordinated pick-and-place cycles in production
	â€¢	Code that is clear, maintainable, and expandable with features like sensors, alarms, or HMI feedback
