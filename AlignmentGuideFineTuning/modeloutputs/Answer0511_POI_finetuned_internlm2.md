ðŸŸ¥ R (Role) â€“ Your Role

ðŸŸ© I (Input) â€“ What Youâ€™re Given

You need to design a function block that:
	â€¢	Accepts a 10Ã—10 REAL matrix as input
	â€¢	Computes and outputs the eigenvalues in a 10-element REAL array
	â€¢	Includes comments explaining the algorithm steps (e.g., normalization, iteration, convergence check)
	â€¢	Handles limitations related to:
	â€¢	Numerical stability (e.g., rounding errors, floating-point limits)
	â€¢	Convergence of iterative algorithms
	â€¢	Execution time and performance in PLC environments

â¸»

ðŸŸ§ S (Steps) â€“ What You Need to Do
	1.	Choose an appropriate algorithm (e.g., Power Iteration or a simplified QR method) suited for a PLCâ€™s processing capabilities
	2.	Create a function block structure with:
	â€¢	Matrix input: MatrixInput : ARRAY[1..10, 1..10] OF REAL
	â€¢	Eigenvalue output: EigenValues : ARRAY[1..10] OF REAL
	3.	Implement the core logic:
	â€¢	Initialize a vector
	â€¢	Perform matrix-vector multiplication
	â€¢	Normalize the vector
	â€¢	Estimate the dominant eigenvalue
	â€¢	Repeat with convergence threshold or iteration limit
	4.	Include detailed inline comments explaining:
	â€¢	Each stepâ€™s mathematical purpose
	â€¢	How you ensure convergence
	â€¢	How fail-safes are built in for real-time performance
	5.	Optionally: create a fallback output or diagnostic flag if the algorithm doesnâ€™t converge within a safe number of cycles

â¸»

ðŸŸ¦ E (Expectation) â€“ What Success Looks Like

You produce a modular, well-documented function block that can be integrated into PLC projects needing matrix analysisâ€”especially useful in model-based control, signal processing, or system diagnostics. The function block:
	â€¢	Provides reasonably accurate eigenvalues under PLC constraints
	â€¢	Performs reliably within execution cycle time limits
	â€¢	Fails safely and predictably if it detects instability or divergence

ðŸŸª A (AI Assistant) â€“ Additional Insights

When implementing eigenvalue calculations in a PLC, consider the following:
	â€¢	Iterative methods like Power Iteration or QR decomposition can be used, but ensure they converge within a reasonable number of iterations.
	â€¢	Handle numerical stability by normalizing the input matrix and vector, and check for convergence using a tolerance threshold.
	â€¢	Optimize for real-time performance by minimizing the number of matrix-vector multiplications and iterations.
	â€¢	Provide clear comments explaining each step of the algorithm, including the purpose of normalization and convergence checks.
	â€¢	Consider adding a fail-safe mechanism to handle cases where the algorithm does not converge within a safe number of iterations, such as returning a default value or flagging the failure.

Focus on creating a self-contained function block that can be easily integrated into a PLC program, ensuring that the algorithm is optimized for real-time performance and that the implementation is robust and numerically stable.
