### Intent:
**Intent Summary:**  
Develop an IEC 61131-3 Structured Text function block to manage CANOpen COBID registration/deregistration with robust error handling, network checks, and dynamic table management for reliable industrial communication.  

*(Focus: CANOpen COBID control, error handling, real-time registration tracking)*

### Prompt:
**EtherCAT State Machine Control Using IEC 61131-3 Structured Text:**

Develop an IEC 61131-3 structured text (ST) program to sequentially transition through all the states of an EtherCAT slave device using the ESM (EtherCAT State Machine) function block. The program should use descriptive state names (such as INIT, PREOP, SAFEOP, OP, etc.) rather than numerical values, ensuring that state transitions occur only when allowed. A 5-second timer delay should be implemented before each state transition to ensure proper timing and stabilization. Discuss the implementation of the EtherCAT state machine, including logic for handling state transitions, error checking, and ensuring compliance with EtherCAT protocol requirements.

ðŸŸ¥ T (Task) â€“ What You Need to Do

Develop an IEC 61131-3 Structured Text (ST) program to control the EtherCAT State Machine (ESM) for a slave device.

ðŸŸ© A (Action) â€“ How to Do It

Write logic that sequentially transitions the slave through the standard EtherCAT states: INIT, PREOP, SAFEOP, and OP. Use symbolic state names instead of numeric values to improve readability. Implement a 5-second timer delay before each transition to ensure stability, and include condition checks to verify that transitions are valid. Incorporate error-handling routines to detect and respond to failed or illegal transitions.

ðŸŸ¦ G (Goal) â€“ What You Want to Achieve

Ensure reliable, protocol-compliant EtherCAT state control with readable, maintainable code that supports safe transitions, proper timing, and real-time fault handling for industrial communication systems.

**EtherCAT State Machine Control:**

Develop a self-contained IEC 61131-3 Structured Text (ST) function block to manage the EtherCAT state machine for a slave device. The function block should include logic to transition the slave through the EtherCAT state sequence (INIT, PREOP, SAFEOP, OP) and handle state transitions with proper timing and error checking. The function block should also include a 5-second delay before each state transition to ensure stability and prevent race conditions. Discuss the implementation of the EtherCAT state machine, including the use of symbolic state names, timing, and error handling, and how this logic can be integrated into a larger control system for reliable industrial communication.
