ðŸŸ¥ R (Role) â€“ Your Role

You are a PLC programmer responsible for reviewing and correcting a traffic light control program written in IEC 61131-3 Structured Text (ST).

ðŸŸ© I (Input) â€“ What Youâ€™re Given

A code snippet is provided with:
	â€¢	Variables for light states (greenLightOn, yellowLightOn, redLightOn)
	â€¢	Inputs such as pedestrianButtonPressed and emergencyVehicleApproaching
	â€¢	A TON timer block for light phase durations
	â€¢	Non-standard constructs like WHILE TRUE DO and WAIT UNTIL, which are not scan-cycle-friendly

â¸»

ðŸŸ§ S (Steps) â€“ What to Do
	1.	Eliminate invalid constructs:
	â€¢	Replace WHILE TRUE DO and WAIT UNTIL with a finite state machine using CASE statements.
	2.	Use a scan-compatible timer:
	â€¢	Keep the TON timer instance persistent across scans.
	â€¢	Only control .IN at proper transition points.
	3.	Define a traffic light state variable:
	â€¢	Use an ENUM type (e.g., IDLE, GREEN, YELLOW, RED, EMERGENCY, PEDESTRIAN_WAIT)
	â€¢	Use transitions driven by inputs and timer outputs
	4.	Handle edge-triggered events:
	â€¢	Detect button presses or emergency signals using R_TRIG blocks
	â€¢	Prevent multiple light transitions in a single scan
	5.	Manage light outputs cleanly:
	â€¢	Set outputs (SetTrafficLights(...)) once per cycle, based on state
	â€¢	Avoid repeatedly toggling lights without transition logic

ðŸŸ¦ E (Expectation) â€“ What You Should Achieve
	â€¢	A reliable traffic light controller that:
	â€¢	Properly prioritizes emergency vehicles
	â€¢	Allows safe pedestrian crossings
	â€¢	Operates using standard PLC scan logic, not blocking loops

ðŸŸ¥ F (Focus) â€“ What to Change

The focus is on correcting the code to ensure it follows PLC best practices, including using a finite state machine for traffic light control, using a persistent timer, and handling edge-triggered events. The code should be revised to ensure it is safe, reliable, and easy to maintain.

â¸»

ðŸŸ© I (Input) â€“ What Youâ€™re Given

The code snippet provided is a PLC program for controlling traffic lights. It uses a while loop to continuously check for pedestrian button presses and emergency vehicle approaches. The program also uses a timer to control the duration of the green and yellow lights. However, the code contains several issues, including the use of non-standard constructs like WHILE TRUE DO and WAIT UNTIL, which are not suitable for PLC programming.

â¸»

ðŸŸ© A (Action) â€“ What You Did

To correct the code, I made the following changes:

1.	Replaced WHILE TRUE DO and WAIT UNTIL with a finite state machine using CASE statements.
2.	Defined a traffic light state variable using an ENUM type (e.g., IDLE, GREEN, YELLOW, RED, EMERGENCY, PEDESTRIAN_WAIT) and used transitions driven by inputs and timer outputs.
3.	Used a persistent TON timer instance to control light phase durations, ensuring it only changes .IN at proper transition points.
4.	Defined a function to read the pedestrian button state and another to read the emergency vehicle sensor state.
5.	Defined a procedure to set the traffic lights based on the current state, ensuring that light outputs are set only once per cycle.

â¸»

ðŸŸ© R (Result) â€“ What You Achieved

The revised code now follows PLC best practices, ensuring safe and reliable traffic light control. It uses a finite state machine to manage light transitions, handles edge-triggered events, and uses a persistent timer for light phase durations. The code is now easy to maintain and extend, with clear logic that prioritizes emergency vehicles and allows safe pedestrian crossings. The use of standard PLC constructs ensures the code will run reliably in a real-time control environment.
