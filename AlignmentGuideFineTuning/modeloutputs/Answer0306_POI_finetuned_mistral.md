### Intent:
**Intent Summary:**  
Develop a ratio control program in IEC 61131-3 Structured Text to maintain a 2:1 flow ratio between two reactants (A and B) in a chemical blending process, dynamically adjusting the setpoint for reactant B based on reactant A's flow while monitoring deviations and triggering alarms if tolerance is exceeded.

### Prompt:
**PID Level Control Distillation Column:**

Develop a self-contained IEC 61131-3 Structured Text program to implement PID feedback control for maintaining the liquid level in a distillation column. The control system should adjust the opening of an inlet valve that feeds liquid into the column based on the level setpoint.

The program should incorporate the PID parameters (proportional, integral, and derivative gains) and handle scenarios where the liquid level deviates from the setpoint. Ensure that the logic includes limits on the inlet valve position to prevent overfeeding or underfeeding the column. Discuss the importance of level control in maintaining the efficiency and stability of the distillation process, focusing on response time and control precision under varying operating conditions.

**C-A-R-E:**

ðŸŸ¥ C (Context) â€“ The Background

In a distillation column, maintaining the liquid level is crucial for ensuring stable separation, preventing tray flooding or drying, and maintaining column pressure balance. Without effective level control, fluctuations in feed or product draw-off can lead to instability, product off-specification, or shutdowns. A PID feedback control strategy helps ensure consistent and safe operation.

ðŸŸ© A (Action) â€“ The Implementation Task

Create a self-contained IEC 61131-3 Structured Text program (not a function block) that:
	â€¢	Implements PID control logic to regulate liquid level in the column
	â€¢	Uses a level transmitter input (Level_PV) and compares it to a setpoint (Level_SP)
	â€¢	Calculates the valve opening for the inlet stream using tuned PID gains: Kp, Ki, Kd
	â€¢	Applies clamping logic to keep the valve position within safe limits (Valve_Min, Valve_Max) to prevent overfeeding or underfeeding

â¸»

ðŸŸ¨ R (Result) â€“ The Expected Outcome

The program should:
	â€¢	Maintain the desired liquid level setpoint, ensuring smooth operation and efficiency of the distillation process
	â€¢	Respond quickly to disturbances in feed flow or internal pressure
	â€¢	Prevent operational issues like tray flooding, process shutdowns, or product losses
	â€¢	Be PLC-deployable, readable, and scalable for use in industrial distillation applications
