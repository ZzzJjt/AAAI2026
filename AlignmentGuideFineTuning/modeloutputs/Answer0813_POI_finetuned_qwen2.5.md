Before

You are a process control engineer tasked with optimizing the operation of a distillation column. The columnâ€™s dynamics are complex, involving nonlinear relationships between feed rates, temperature, and pressure. Without a mathematical model, itâ€™s difficult to implement advanced control strategies such as model predictive control (MPC) to ensure efficient and stable operation.

After

You have developed a MATLAB-based mathematical model of the distillation columnâ€™s dynamics. The model captures the relationship between feed rates and temperature, allowing for accurate simulation of the columnâ€™s behavior. Using this model, you implement a model predictive control (MPC) scheme to optimize the distillation process. The MPC algorithm calculates optimal control actions based on the modelâ€™s predictive capability, ensuring that the column operates efficiently and within defined operational limits.

Result

The distillation columnâ€™s performance is optimized, with improved efficiency and stability. The implementation of MPC using the mathematical model provides a powerful tool for real-time control, enabling the column to respond effectively to disturbances and variations in feed rates.

Role

You are a control systems engineer responsible for optimizing the operation of a distillation column in a chemical plant.

Input

You are provided with a description of the distillation process, including the relationship between feed rates, temperature, and pressure. However, no mathematical model or control strategy is available.

Steps

	1.	Model the distillation columnâ€™s dynamics using MATLAB, capturing the relationship between feed rates and temperature.
	2.	Implement a model predictive control (MPC) algorithm using the developed model to optimize the distillation process.
	3.	Ensure the MPC scheme accounts for operational constraints, such as maximum and minimum temperature limits, and feed rate variability.

Output

You deliver a MATLAB script that models the distillation columnâ€™s dynamics and includes an MPC controller to optimize the process. The script should be executable without plotting results, focusing on the core control logic and simulation of the distillation process under varying conditions.

Key to Success

	â€¢	Accurate representation of the distillation processâ€™s nonlinear dynamics
