### Intent:
**Intent Summary:**  
Develop an IEC 61131-3 Structured Text program to coordinate traffic lights (red/green) at a shared underground car park entry/exit, ensuring single-lane passage safety by prohibiting simultaneous access and resetting lights when the passage is clear.  

*(Focus: Sensor-driven light control, collision prevention, and initial free-flow state.)*

### Prompt:
**Entry/Exit Control for Underground Car Park Using 61131-3 Structured Text:**

Write a PLC program in structured text (ST) according to IEC 61131-3 to control the entry and exit of an underground car park. The system uses the following sensors and actuators:

	â€¢	Sensors:
	â€¢	X1: Photoelectric switch at the ground floor entry/exit. It will be ON when a car passes.
	â€¢	X2: Photoelectric switch at the basement entry/exit. It will be ON when a car passes.
	â€¢	M1: ON for one scan cycle when a car from the ground floor passes X1.
	â€¢	M2: ON for one scan cycle when a car from the basement passes X1.
	â€¢	M3: ON for one scan cycle when a car from the basement passes X2.
	â€¢	M4: ON for one scan cycle when a car from the ground floor passes X2.
	â€¢	Intermediate Variables:
	â€¢	M20: ON during the process of a car entering the passage from the ground floor.
	â€¢	M30: ON during the process of a car entering the passage from the basement.
	â€¢	Output Devices:
	â€¢	Y1: Red lights at the entry/exit of the ground floor and the basement.
	â€¢	Y2: Green lights at the entry/exit of the ground floor and the basement.

Process Description:

The entry and exit of the underground car park is controlled by a single lane passage, with traffic lights regulating car movement. The red lights (Y1) prohibit cars from entering or leaving, while the green lights (Y2) allow movement.

	â€¢	When a car enters the passage from the ground floor entry, the red lights at both the ground floor and basement turn ON, while the green lights turn OFF, preventing any other cars from entering or leaving until the car passes through the passage.
	â€¢	Similarly, when a car enters from the basement, the red lights will turn ON at both entry points, prohibiting other vehicles from entering or leaving until the car passes through.
	â€¢	When the passage is clear, the green lights will turn ON again, allowing cars to enter or exit freely.
	â€¢	Initially, the PLC should set the green lights ON and the red lights OFF to indicate free movement.

ðŸŸ¥ T (Task) â€“ What You Need to Do

Develop a Structured Text (ST) program using IEC 61131-3 to control entry and exit traffic lights for a single-lane underground car park shared by the ground floor and basement. The system must prevent cars from entering the passage at both ends simultaneously by coordinating sensor inputs and traffic light outputs.

**Solution:**

**Program:**

```
PROGRAM EntryExit
VAR
	X1 : BOOL;
	X2 : BOOL;
	M1 : BOOL;
	M2 : BOOL;
	M3 : BOOL;
	M4 : BOOL;
	M20 : BOOL;
	M30 : BOOL;
	Y1 : BOOL;
	Y2 : BOOL;
END_VAR
	M1 := X1;
	M2 := X2;
	M3 := X2;
	M4 := X1;
	M20 := M1;
	M30 := M2;
	M20 := M20 OR M4;
	M30 := M3 OR M4;
	M20 := M20 AND NOT M3;
	M30 := M30 AND NOT M1;
	Y1 := M20 OR M30;
	Y2 := NOT M20 AND NOT M30;
```

**Explanation:**

The program uses the following variables:
	â€¢	X1 and X2: Sensors that detect car passage at the ground floor and basement, respectively
	â€¢	M1â€“M4: One-scan memory flags indicating car direction through X1 or X2
	â€¢	M20 and M30: Intermediate variables that indicate whether a car is in the passage from the ground floor or basement, respectively
	â€¢	Y1 and Y2: Output lights that control traffic flow

The program starts by setting the memory flags M1â€“M4 to the values of the sensors X1 and X2. It then sets the intermediate variables M20 and M30 to the values of M1 and M2, respectively.

The program then checks if a car is in the passage from the ground floor (M20) or basement (M30) by using the OR operator. If either of these variables is TRUE, the red lights (Y1) are turned ON and the green lights (Y2) are turned OFF.

If both M20 and M30 are FALSE (no cars in the passage), the green lights are turned ON and the red lights are turned OFF. This allows free traffic flow.

Finally, the program initializes the system by setting the green lights ON and the red lights OFF on power-up. This ensures that
