### Prompt:
**PID Flow Control Water Treatment:**

Ensure the program accounts for any deviations from the setpoint and adjusts the chemical dosing accordingly, while including safety limits to prevent overdosing or underdosing. Discuss the importance of precise flow control in water treatment, with a focus on maintaining safe and effective chemical levels.

**B-A-B:**

ðŸŸ¥ B (Before) â€“ The Challenge

In water treatment processes, maintaining the correct chlorine dosing level is critical to ensure safe disinfection without risking overdosing or chemical waste.
