### Intent:
**Intent Summary:**  
Generate a structured I/O list table with 30 entries for a steel rolling mill, including signal names, I/O types, tagnumbers, analog/digital classification, engineering units, ranges, setpoints, and P&ID references, to standardize PLC and instrumentation documentation.  

*(Focus: Automation engineering, signal mapping, control system integration.)*

### Prompt:
**IO List Rolling Mill:**

Create an I/O list as a table with 30 lines for a rolling mill in a steel production plant. Have as columns signal name, input/output, signal tagnumber, analog/digital, engineering unit, ranges, setpoint, and P&ID reference.

**B-A-B:**

ðŸŸ¥ B (Before) â€“ The Problem or Challenge

Designing and integrating control systems for a rolling mill in a steel production plant requires a detailed and standardized I/O list. Without a well-organized table capturing key signal characteristics, such as I/O type, ranges, and engineering units, engineers risk miswiring, mismatches in PLC logic, and inconsistent documentation across instrumentation, control panels, and HMI systems.

ðŸŸ© A (After) â€“ The Desired Outcome

Create a structured I/O list table with 30 entries specific to a rolling mill system. The table should include the following columns for each signal:
	â€¢	Signal Name
	â€¢	Input/Output
	â€¢	Signal Tagnumber
	â€¢	Analog/Digital
	â€¢	Engineering Unit
	â€¢	Range
	â€¢	Setpoint
	â€¢	P&ID Reference

This list should serve as a foundation for instrumentation wiring, PLC configuration, and control narrative alignment, ensuring that all process signals are properly identified and described.

ðŸŸ§ B (Bridge) â€“ How to Get There
	1.	Identify typical signals in a rolling mill (e.g., entry tension, roll force, speed feedback, motor current, cooling valve command).
	2.	For each of the 30 entries, define:
	â€¢	Whether the signal is an input (sensor) or output (actuator)
	â€¢	Its analog/digital type
	â€¢	Units such as bar, Â°C, m/min, kN
	â€¢	Expected range and setpoint values
	â€¢	Reference back to a P&ID drawing for traceability
	3.	Present the data in a clean, consistent tabular format, suitable for use in Excel, a PDF datasheet, or PLC documentation.
