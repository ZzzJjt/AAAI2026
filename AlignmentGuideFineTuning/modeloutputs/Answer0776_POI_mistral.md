### Intent:
**Intent Summary:**  
Develop an ISA-88-compliant IEC 61131-3 Structured Text program to automate the batch production of polyethylene, covering raw material preparation through packaging, with modular phase logic, conditional transitions, and fault handling, while addressing PLC-specific challenges like timing and synchronization.  

*(Focus: Batch control, modularity, PLC constraints, full production cycle)*

### Prompt:
**Batch Polyethylene:**

Develop a self-contained program in IEC 61131-3 Structured Text to implement batch control for a polyethylene production process. The program should cover the full production cycle, including the following steps: raw material preparation, polymerization, quenching, drying, pelletizing, quality control, and packaging and storage. Ensure that each step is clearly defined and appropriately sequenced with transitions, and provide detailed comments explaining the logic and control conditions for each phase. Discuss the challenges of integrating batch control into a PLC environment, including timing, resource allocation, and synchronization across multiple production units.

**R-T-F:**

ðŸŸ¥ R (Role) â€“ Define Your Role

Act as a PLC and batch control engineer implementing ISA-88-compliant automation for polymer production using IEC 61131-3 Structured Text.

ðŸŸ© T (Task) â€“ Define the Objective

Develop a self-contained Structured Text program to control the entire batch production process of polyethylene. The process must include the following steps:
	â€¢	Raw material preparation
	â€¢	Polymerization
	â€¢	Quenching
	â€¢	Drying
	â€¢	Pelletizing
	â€¢	Quality control
	â€¢	Packaging and storage

Each phase must be modular and clearly defined, using timers, setpoints, and conditional transitions. The program should follow ISA-88 principles, separating procedural and equipment control logic. Add detailed inline comments explaining control parameters and sequencing conditions. Also, consider key challenges in PLC-based batch control, such as resource synchronization, timing accuracy, and cross-unit coordination.

ðŸŸ§ F (Format) â€“ Specify the Output Format

Provide:
	â€¢	A fully modular IEC 61131-3 Structured Text code structure with separate logic blocks for each phase
	â€¢	Timer-based sequencing and conditional transitions
	â€¢	Function or method calls (e.g., StartHeating, BeginPelletizing) with input parameters
	â€¢	Comments throughout the code for clarity and ISA-88 alignment
	â€¢	Optional discussion section (as comments or documentation) on PLC integration challenges and design decisions
