**1. Introduction to Classes and Methods**

In IEC 61131-3 Version 3.0, classes and methods are introduced as a way to organize and structure code, making it more modular, reusable, and maintainable. A class is a blueprint for creating objects, which are instances of that class. Methods are functions defined within a class that can be called on its instances.

**Advantages:**

*   Encapsulation: Data and behavior are bundled together, reducing coupling between components.
*   Reusability: Classes can be reused across different projects or applications.
*   Modularity: Code is organized into smaller, manageable units.

**Limitations:**

*   Increased complexity: Debugging and testing can become more challenging due to increased abstraction.
*   Vendor support: Not all PLC vendors fully support OOP features, limiting portability.

**Example: Defining and Using a Class**

```st
// Define a class for a batch control process
Class BatchControlProcess {
    // Attributes
    Var rawMaterial As Real;
    Var reactionTemperature As Real;
    Var coolingTime As Time;

    // Methods
    Function rawMaterialPreparation(rawMaterial As Real) As Boolean
        // Validate input
        If rawMaterial < 0 Then
            Return False;
        EndIf;
        // Perform preparation
        rawMaterial = rawMaterial * 1.1; // Add 10% buffer
        Return True;
    EndFunction;

    Function startReaction(reactionTemperature As Real) As Boolean
        // Validate input
        If reactionTemperature < 0 Then
            Return False;
        EndIf;
        // Start reaction
        reactionTemperature = reactionTemperature + 5; // Increase temperature
        Return True;
    EndFunction;

    Function coolDown(coolingTime As Time) As Boolean
        // Validate input
        If coolingTime < 0 Then
            Return False;
        EndIf;
        // Cool down
        coolingTime = coolingTime - 10; // Reduce cooling time
        Return True;
    EndFunction;
}

// Create an instance of the class
Var batchControl As BatchControlProcess;

// Call methods on the instance
batchControl.rawMaterialPreparation(100);
batchControl.startReaction(200);
batchControl.coolDown(300);
```
