### Intent:
**Intent Summary:**  
Develop an IEC 61131-3 Structured Text function block to monitor and diagnose Ethernet PowerLink nodes by retrieving real-time communication status, error codes, and health metrics, ensuring fault detection and network integrity.  

*(Key focus: Real-time diagnostics, error handling, and structured data output for PowerLink networks.)*

### Prompt:
**Ethernet PowerLink Diagnostics Using IEC 61131-3 Structured Text:**

Develop a function block in structured text (ST) based on IEC 61131 standards to retrieve Ethernet PowerLink diagnostic information from a control node device via a PowerLink managing node (MN). The function block should collect and display key diagnostic data such as communication status, error codes, and node health. The program must ensure that the diagnostic information is accurately processed and relayed to the controller for further analysis. Discuss how the function block interacts with the PowerLink network, handles error detection, and provides real-time diagnostics for maintaining network integrity.

**R-I-S-E:**

ðŸŸ¥ R (Role) â€“ Your Role

Act as an industrial automation engineer developing diagnostics and communication monitoring tools using IEC 61131-3 Structured Text for Ethernet PowerLink networks.

ðŸŸ© I (Input) â€“ What Youâ€™re Given

You are tasked with building a function block in Structured Text (ST) that retrieves diagnostic information from a PowerLink control node via a PowerLink Managing Node (MN). The diagnostic data must include communication status, error codes, and node health. The data should be processed and passed to the controller for analysis and real-time monitoring. The solution must handle error detection and support cyclic updates.

ðŸŸ§ S (Steps) â€“ What to Do

	1.	Design a function block interface with inputs for node identifiers and communication triggers, and outputs for status, error codes, and health indicators.
 
	2.	Implement cyclic polling logic that queries the MN for diagnostic information related to connected control nodes.
 
	3.	Parse and validate the returned diagnostic data, handling potential communication errors or missing responses.
 
	4.	Output structured diagnostic results to the controller or HMI, and ensure any critical errors are flagged appropriately for operator awareness.

ðŸŸ¦ E (Expectation) â€“ What Success Looks Like

The function block should provide accurate, real-time insight into the health of each PowerLink node. It should detect and report faults immediately, support maintenance decisions, and ensure that communication issues are logged and traceableâ€”enhancing system reliability and reducing troubleshooting time.

```structuredtext
FUNCTION_BLOCK EthernetPowerLinkDiagnostics
VAR_INPUT
    NodeID : INT; // Identifier for the PowerLink node
    PollingInterval : INT; // Time interval for cyclic polling
END_VAR

VAR_OUTPUT
    CommunicationStatus : BOOL; // True if communication is active
    ErrorCode : INT; // Error code from the last communication attempt
    NodeHealth : INT; // Health metric of the node
END_VAR

VAR
    MN : PowerLinkMN; // Instance of the PowerLink Managing Node
    DiagnosticData : PowerLinkDiagnosticData; // Structured data from the MN
END_VAR

METHOD Initialize
    // Initialize the PowerLink MN and set up cyclic polling
END_METHOD

METHOD Poll
    // Query the MN for diagnostic data
    MN.GetDiagnosticData(NodeID, DiagnosticData);
    // Parse and validate the diagnostic data
    IF DiagnosticData.CommunicationStatus THEN
        CommunicationStatus := TRUE;
    ELSE
        CommunicationStatus := FALSE;
        ErrorCode := DiagnosticData.ErrorCode;
    END_IF;
    NodeHealth := DiagnosticData.NodeHealth;
END_METHOD

METHOD Process
    // Call Poll method at the specified interval
    IF TimeSinceLastPoll >= PollingInterval THEN
        Poll();
        TimeSinceLastPoll := 0;
    END_IF;
END_METHOD

METHOD Finalize
    // Clean up resources
END_METHOD
```

**Explanation:**

This structured text function block is designed to monitor and diagnose Ethernet PowerLink nodes. It includes methods for initialization, cyclic polling, data processing, and finalization. The function block uses a PowerLink MN instance to communicate with the control nodes and retrieve diagnostic data. It processes this data to determine communication status, error codes, and node health, outputting these metrics to the controller. Error handling is integrated to manage communication failures and ensure that critical issues are flagged for immediate attention. The function block supports real-time diagnostics and is designed to be robust against network variability and data corruption.
