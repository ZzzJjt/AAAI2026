ðŸŸ¥ T (Task) â€“ What You Need to Do

Create a self-contained function block in IEC 61131-3 Structured Text that performs linear interpolation between two known data points.

â¸»

ðŸŸ© A (Action) â€“ How to Do It
	1.	Define a function block named LinearInterpolation with the following REAL inputs:
	â€¢	X1, Y1: First known point
	â€¢	X2, Y2: Second known point
	â€¢	X: The value at which interpolation should occur
	2.	Compute the interpolated output Y using the formula:
Y := Y1 + \frac{(X - X1) \times (Y2 - Y1)}{(X2 - X1)}
Add a conditional check to avoid division by zero:
IF X2 <> X1 THEN
    Y := Y1 + ((X - X1) * (Y2 - Y1)) / (X2 - X1);
ELSE
    Y := Y1; // Or use fallback logic
END_IF;
3.	Include inline comments that explain each part of the calculation.
	4.	Address floating-point rounding and real-time scan cycle constraints, ensuring the block runs efficiently in control applications.

â¸»

ðŸŸ¦ G (Goal) â€“ What You Want to Achieve

Provide a reusable, lightweight, and accurate function block for linear interpolation that supports applications like:
	â€¢	Sensor signal scaling
	â€¢	Analog-to-digital conversion mapping
	â€¢	Dynamic setpoint adjustments

The function block must ensure safe, predictable results and be suitable for deployment in real-time PLC environments.

ðŸŸ¦ G (Goal) â€“ What You Want to Achieve

Provide a reusable, lightweight, and accurate function block for linear interpolation that supports applications like:
	â€¢	Sensor signal scaling
	â€¢	Analog-to-digital conversion mapping
	â€¢	Dynamic setpoint adjustments

The function block must ensure safe, predictable results and be suitable for deployment in real-time PLC environments. It should be easy to understand and use, with clear documentation and inline comments.

**Example Usage:**

In a PLC program, you can use the LinearInterpolation function block to scale a sensor signal from 0-10 V to 0-100% of a setpoint. The function block would be called with the following inputs:
â€¢	X1: 0 (sensor signal)
â€¢	Y1: 0 (setpoint)
â€¢	X2: 10 (sensor signal)
â€¢	Y2: 100 (setpoint)
â€¢	X: 5 (sensor signal)

The function block would return the interpolated setpoint value, which would be 50 in this case.

**Additional Considerations:**

â€¢	Consider the range of input values and the desired output range to ensure the function block is suitable for the specific application.
â€¢	Ensure the function block is designed to handle potential edge cases, such as when X1 = X2 or when X is outside the range of X1 and X2.
â€¢	Consider the impact of floating-point rounding errors on the accuracy of the interpolation and implement appropriate error handling or compensation mechanisms.
â€¢	Optimize the function block for real-time performance, taking into account the scan cycle time and any potential bottlenecks in the calculation.
â€¢	Provide clear documentation and inline comments to explain the function block's purpose, inputs, outputs, and any potential limitations or considerations for use in industrial control systems.
