### Intent:
**Intent Summary:**  
Develop an IEC 61131-3 Structured Text function block to monitor OPC UA, Modbus, and Profinet connections, trigger alarms on failures, and log detailed audit trail entries with error codes for real-time diagnostics.  

**Code Generation Intent:**  
Create a reusable ST function block that cyclically checks communication statuses, manages protocol-specific alarms, and logs failures with timestamps/error details for OPC UA, Modbus, and Profinet.

### Prompt:
**Communication Monitoring for OPC UA, Modbus, and Profinet Using IEC 61131-3 Structured Text:**

Develop a function block in structured text (ST) as per IEC 61131-3 standards to monitor communication connections to an OPC UA server, Modbus server, and Profinet in a machine system. The function block should continuously check the connection status of each protocol, and if any connection fails, an alarm should be triggered. Additionally, when a connection is lost, an entry must be created in the audit trail, detailing the reason for the server being down along with the corresponding error code. Discuss the implementation logic for monitoring multiple protocols, error detection, and how to effectively manage and log communication failures for real-time monitoring and troubleshooting.

ðŸŸ¥ R (Role) â€“ Your Role

Act as a control systems engineer developing IEC 61131-3 Structured Text (ST) function blocks for real-time communication monitoring in industrial automation systems.

ðŸŸ© I (Input) â€“ What Youâ€™re Given

You need to create a function block that monitors communication links to an OPC UA server, a Modbus server, and a Profinet device. The function block must detect connection failures, trigger alarms for each protocol independently, and generate audit trail entries that include error codes and reasons for the failure. It should operate cyclically and be capable of managing multiple protocol states simultaneously.

ðŸŸ§ S (Steps) â€“ What You Need to Do
	1.	Design a function block in Structured Text (ST) with input parameters for each protocolâ€™s connection state and error details.
	2.	Implement logic to detect status changes, timeouts, or communication faults.
	3.	When a failure is detected, raise an alarm (e.g., set a BOOL flag or output an error code) and log a detailed audit entry including timestamp, protocol type, error reason, and code.
	4.	Ensure that the function block handles each protocol independently and resets alarms or logs recovery if communication is restored.

ðŸŸ¦ E (Expectation) â€“ What Success Looks Like

The result should be a robust, reusable ST function block capable of continuously monitoring OPC UA, Modbus, and Profinet connections. It should trigger real-time alarms for any failures and provide accurate, timestamped audit trail entries to support fast diagnostics, improved uptime, and system-wide communication transparency.

**C-A-S-E:**

ðŸŸ¥ C (Context) â€“ The Situation

In industrial automation systems, communication between different protocols (e.g., OPC UA, Modbus, and Profinet) is critical for real-time data exchange and control. Ensuring that all communication links are operational is essential for maintaining system stability and preventing downtime. However, monitoring multiple protocols can be challenging, especially when dealing with complex error codes and real-time diagnostics.

ðŸŸ© A (Action) â€“ What You Should Do

To address this challenge, develop a self-contained function block in Structured Text (ST) that monitors communication links to an OPC UA server, a Modbus server, and a Profinet device. The function block should continuously check the status of each protocol, detect failures, and raise alarms. When a failure occurs, the function block should log detailed audit trail entries, including the protocol type, error reason, and error code. Ensure that the function block handles each protocol independently and resets alarms or logs recovery if communication is restored.

ðŸŸ¨ S (Strategy) â€“ How to Do It

1.	Design a function block in Structured Text (ST) with input parameters for each protocolâ€™s connection state and error details. Include a self-contained logic to detect status changes, timeouts, or communication faults.
2.	Implement logic to raise an alarm (e.g., set a BOOL flag or output an error code) when a failure is detected. Ensure that the alarm is triggered independently for each protocol.
3.	Generate detailed audit trail entries for each failure, including the timestamp, protocol type, error reason, and error code. Ensure that the audit trail entries are self-contained and can be easily read by human operators or diagnostic tools.
4.	Ensure that the function block handles each protocol independently and resets alarms or logs recovery if communication is restored. This will help maintain system stability and prevent false alarms.

ðŸŸ© R (Result) â€“ What You Should Achieve

The result should be a self-contained function block in Structured Text (ST) that can monitor communication links to an OPC UA server, a Modbus server, and a Profinet device. The function block should detect failures, raise alarms, and generate detailed
