### Intent:
**Intent Summary:**  
Implement an ANN-based temperature control system for a chemical reactor in Python to achieve superior regulation over traditional methods by leveraging predictive and adaptive capabilities for nonlinear, dynamic conditions.

### Prompt:
**Artificial Neural Network Control for Temperature Regulation in a Chemical Reactor Using Python:**

**Origin**

Develop Python code to implement an artificial neural network (ANN) for advanced process control of the temperature in a chemical reactor. The control system should leverage the predictive and adaptive capabilities of ANNs to manage the reactorâ€™s temperature, considering the nonlinear and time-varying nature of the reactorâ€™s dynamics. Train the ANN using historical process data to optimize temperature control, ensuring stability and efficiency under varying operational conditions.

Implement Python code to simulate the chemical reactorâ€™s temperature control dynamics and demonstrate how ANN-based control can outperform traditional methods in handling complex, nonlinear systems.

# Step 1: Generate Simulated Data
np.random.seed(42)

# Simulate 1000 data points of temperature and pressure
temperature = np.random.normal(50, 5, 1000)
pressure = np.random.normal(100, 10, 1000)

# Add noise to simulate measurement errors
temperature += np.random.normal(0, 2, 1000)
pressure += np.random.normal(0, 5, 1000)

# Step 2: Preprocess Data
# Normalize temperature and pressure to [0, 1]
temperature_norm = (temperature - np.min(temperature)) / (np.max(temperature) - np.min(temperature))
pressure_norm = (pressure - np.min(pressure)) / (np.max(pressure) - np.min(pressure))

# Step 3: Split Data
train_size = int(0.8 * len(temperature))
train_data = np.column_stack([temperature_norm[:train_size], pressure_norm[:train_size]])
test_data = np.column_stack([temperature_norm[train_size:], pressure_norm[train_size:]])

# Step 4: Train ANN Model
ann_model = MLPRegressor(hidden_layer_sizes=(10, 5), max_iter=1000, activation='relu', solver='adam', alpha=0.001)
ann_model.fit(train_data, np.zeros(train_size))  # Train to predict temperature from pressure

# Step 5: Evaluate Model
predicted_temperature = ann_model.predict(test_data)

# Plot actual vs predicted temperature
