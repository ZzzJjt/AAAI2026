### Intent:
The task is to create a text-based Process Flow Diagram (PFD) for penicillin fermentation, detailing process units, instrumentation, flow directions, and control logic (e.g., PID loops) to support automation design and process control implementation.  

**Intent Summary:**  
*Generate a structured textual PFD for penicillin fermentation with units, instrumentation tags, flow paths, and control philosophy (e.g., temperature/pH regulation via PID loops).*

### Prompt:
**PFD Penicillin Fermentation:**

Create a Process Flow Diagram (PFD) in textual notation for a fermentation process to produce penicillin. Include instrumentation and control philosophy.

**R-T-F:**

ðŸŸ¥ R (Role) â€“ Define Your Role

Act as a process design engineer documenting the penicillin fermentation process using a text-based Process Flow Diagram (PFD) to support automation design and process control implementation.

â¸»

ðŸŸ© T (Task) â€“ Define the Objective

Create a PFD in textual notation that includes:
	â€¢	The main process units (e.g., water tank, nutrient mixer, sterilizer, fermenter, separator, product tank)
	â€¢	Flow direction between units using arrows (-->)
	â€¢	Key instrumentation with specific tag names (e.g., TT101, pH201, LT301)
	â€¢	A concise control philosophy, describing how critical parameters (temperature, pH, agitation) are monitored and controlledâ€”such as using PID loops or manual setpoints

â¸»

ðŸŸ§ F (Format) â€“ Specify the Output Format

Present the information in a structured plain-text format, including:
	â€¢	A flow line for each process stage
	â€¢	A block below each unit showing associated instruments and control loops
	â€¢	Consistent use of indentation, tag naming, and directional symbols
	â€¢	Example control loop logic such as:

 TT201 â†’ TIC201 â†’ Steam Control Valve (TCV201)
