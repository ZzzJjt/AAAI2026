🟩 I (Input) – What You’re Given

You are provided with:
	•	A 100-element integer input array:
InputArray: ARRAY[1..100] OF INT
	•	The requirement to compute:
	•	The mean (arithmetic average)
	•	The sample standard deviation
	•	Constraints such as:
	•	Limited processing power and memory on PLCs
	•	The need for real-time execution within a control scan cycle
	•	Potential for overflow or precision loss during integer summation and squared operations

⸻

🟧 S (Steps) – What You Need to Do
	1.	Create a function block named MeanStdDevCalculator with appropriate inputs and outputs:
 VAR_INPUT
    InputArray : ARRAY[1..100] OF INT;
  END_VAR
  VAR_OUTPUT
    Mean : REAL;
    StdDev : REAL;
  END_VAR
  2.	Implement logic for the mean:
	•	Accumulate the sum using a loop with a REAL accumulator to avoid overflow
	•	Divide by 100.0 to obtain the mean
	3.	Implement logic for the standard deviation:
	•	Loop again through the array
	•	Subtract the mean from each element, square the result, and accumulate
	•	Divide by 99.0 (N - 1) and apply the square root function to get the standard deviation
	4.	Use inline comments to explain each part of the process:
	•	Why REAL is used for intermediate variables
	•	Why the divisor is 99.0 (for sample standard deviation)
	•	Error checking strategies (optional)
	5.	Optimize for real-time use:
	•	Use fixed-size loops for deterministic timing
	•	Avoid dynamic memory or recursive calls
	•	Test on target PLC hardware to ensure execution fits within scan time

⸻

🟦 E (Expectation) – What Success Looks Like

You deliver a fully operational, modular function block that:
	•	Accurately calculates the mean and standard deviation of a 100-element integer array
	•	Executes efficiently and predictably within a real-time PLC scan cycle
	•	Is applicable to:
	•	Process monitoring
	•	Sensor signal diagnostics
	•	Quality control and statistical alarms
	•	Is reusable and maintainable, with well-commented logic and clear structure
