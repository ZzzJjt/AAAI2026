### Intent:
**Intent Summary:**  
Create a Structured Text program that maintains a 2:1 flow ratio between two reactants (A and B) with safety checks, emergency stop handling, and alarm management for an industrial mixing process.

### Prompt:
**Programming Reference:**
Compile a comprehensive list of all valid keywords used in the IEC 61131-3 Structured Text programming language, ensuring that it covers both standard control flow structures and data types. Include examples of usage for key functions where applicable.

**T-A-G:**

游린 T (Task)

Create a programming reference for the IEC 61131-3 Structured Text (ST) language by compiling a complete list of valid keywords.

游릴 A (Action)

Gather and categorize all official keywords specified in the IEC 61131-3 standard, including control flow structures (such as IF, CASE, FOR), standard functions (TON, CTU, ABS), and data types (INT, REAL, BOOL). Include concise usage examples or code snippets to illustrate how key functions and structures are typically used in automation programming.

游릱 G (Goal)

Deliver a well-organized, easy-to-use reference guide that supports engineers and developers in writing correct, efficient, and standards-compliant Structured Text code for industrial control systems.

游린 T (Task)

Create a Structured Text program that maintains a 2:1 flow ratio between two reactants (A and B) with safety checks, emergency stop handling, and alarm management for an industrial mixing process.

游릴 A (Action)

1. Define the required variables and constants for the program, including flow rates, safety limits, and alarm thresholds.
2. Implement a control loop that continuously monitors the flow rates of reactants A and B.
3. Use conditional statements (IF, CASE) to adjust the flow rates of reactants A and B to maintain a 2:1 ratio.
4. Implement safety checks to prevent overflows or underflows in the mixing process.
5. Include emergency stop functionality to halt the process in case of an emergency.
6. Implement alarm management to notify operators of any deviations from the desired flow ratio or safety limits.

游릱 G (Goal)

Develop a Structured Text program that ensures a safe and efficient mixing process while maintaining a 2:1 flow ratio between reactants A and B. The program should be robust, reliable, and easy to maintain, with clear documentation and error handling.
