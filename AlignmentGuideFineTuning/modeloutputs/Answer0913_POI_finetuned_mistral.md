### Intent:
The task is to develop a PID feedback control program in Structured Text for regulating chlorine dosing in water treatment, maintaining a setpoint of 3.0 ppm with safety limits, error handling, and emergency stop functionality.

### Prompt:
**Feedforward Control Conveyor:**

Develop a self-contained IEC 61131-3 Structured Text program (not a function block) to implement feedforward control for adjusting the speed of a conveyor belt based on sensor-predicted load changes. The program should use input from sensors that predict the weight or volume of material entering the conveyor system, allowing for real-time adjustments to the belt speed before a load change occurs.

Include logic that calculates the required conveyor speed based on the predicted load and adjusts the motor speed accordingly, ensuring that the conveyor operates efficiently without overloading or underloading. Discuss the benefits of feedforward control in conveyor systems, particularly in reducing delays and improving response times compared to feedback-only control strategies.

ðŸŸ¥ T (Task) â€“ What You Need to Do

Write a self-contained IEC 61131-3 Structured Text program (not a function block) to implement feedforward control for adjusting the speed of a conveyor belt based on predicted material load from sensors.

â¸»

ðŸŸ© A (Action) â€“ How to Do It
	1.	Read input from a load prediction sensor that estimates the weight or volume of incoming material (e.g., Predicted_Load in kg or units).
	2.	Apply a feedforward control formula to calculate conveyor speed:
	â€¢	Conveyor_Speed := Base_Speed + Gain_FF * Predicted_Load
	â€¢	Where Base_Speed is the minimum conveyor speed and Gain_FF is the feedforward gain constant.
	3.	Constrain the calculated speed within operational limits (e.g., 0.5 m/s to 2.0 m/s) to ensure safe and stable performance.
	4.	Send the output speed value (Conveyor_Speed) to the conveyor motor controller.

ðŸŸ¦ G (Goal) â€“ What You Want to Achieve

Ensure that the conveyor:
	â€¢	Preemptively adjusts speed in response to load predictions
	â€¢	Avoids overloads or idle time, improving energy efficiency and reducing wear
	â€¢	Responds faster than feedback-only control, especially in high-speed or variable-load systems
	â€¢	Operates smoothly with simple, maintainable logic that is ready for integration in real-world PLC applications

âœ… Example Code (Structured Text)

VAR
    Predicted_Load : REAL;         // Load input from sensor
    Base_Speed : REAL := 1.0;      // Minimum conveyor speed in m/s
    Gain_FF : REAL := 0.02;        // Speed gain factor per unit load
    Conveyor_Speed : REAL;
END_VAR

// Calculate conveyor speed using feedforward logic
Conveyor_Speed := Base_Speed + Gain_FF * Predicted_Load;

// Clamp conveyor speed within safe operational range
IF Conveyor_Speed > 2.0 THEN
    Conveyor_Speed := 2.0;
ELSIF Conveyor_Speed < 0.5 THEN
    Conveyor_Speed := 0.5;
END_IF

// Output Conveyor_Speed to motor controller
