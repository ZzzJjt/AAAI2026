### Intent:
**Intent Summary:**  
Create a structured reference document listing all mathematical function blocks in the OSCAT library, categorized by type (e.g., trigonometric, statistical), with descriptions and industrial use cases to streamline PLC programming and team onboarding.  

**Industrial Control Task (UreaReactionControl):**  
Automate a urea synthesis process by controlling valve operations, monitoring pressure/temperature, and timing the reaction while ensuring safety via fault detection and state-based logic.  

**Code Generation Intent:**  
Generate a state-machine-driven PLC program to manage urea production phases (loading, reacting, completion) with valve control, sensor validation, and fault handling.

### Prompt:
**List Mathematical Function Blocks:**
Compile a detailed list of all mathematical function blocks available in the OSCAT library for PLC programming, including a brief description of their functionality and typical use cases.

**R-I-S-E:**

ðŸŸ¥ R (Role) â€“ Your Role

You are a PLC developer or automation engineer using the OSCAT library to implement complex mathematical operations in control systems. To improve your workflow and assist your team, you aim to create a clear and accessible reference.

â¸»

ðŸŸ© I (Input) â€“ What Youâ€™re Given

You have access to the OSCAT library documentation or source files, which contain numerous mathematical function blocks (e.g., trigonometric, algebraic, statistical). However, these blocks are not centrally organized, and many lack contextual descriptions or usage examples.

â¸»

ðŸŸ§ S (Steps) â€“ How to Proceed
	1.	Explore the OSCAT library (docs or codebase) and extract all function blocks under the mathematical category.
	2.	Organize the function blocks into logical categories such as:
	â€¢	Trigonometric
	â€¢	Exponential & Logarithmic
	â€¢	Statistical
	â€¢	Algebraic
	3.	For each function block, write:
	â€¢	Its name
	â€¢	A brief functional description
	â€¢	A typical industrial use case or application context
	4.	Optionally, provide notes on parameter types, return values, or limitations (e.g., expected units, input range).
	5.	Present the final list in a structured format (table or markdown list).

â¸»

ðŸŸ¦ E (Expectation) â€“ What the Output Should Look Like

A well-organized reference list of OSCATâ€™s mathematical function blocks that:
	â€¢	Helps engineers quickly find the right block for a task
	â€¢	Serves as a training tool for newcomers
	â€¢	Boosts development speed and reduces reliance on searching through source code
	â€¢	Enhances code reliability by encouraging proper block selection based on descriptions and use cases

**Notes:**
- All functions expect input values in radians for trigonometric functions and natural logarithms.
- The `exp` function returns a value in the range of 0 to infinity.
- The `log` function returns a value in the range of negative infinity to infinity.
- The `mean` and `median` functions require a non-empty input array.
- The `add` and `subtract` functions return the sum or difference of the input values, respectively.
