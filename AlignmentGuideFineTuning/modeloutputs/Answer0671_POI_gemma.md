**Control Narrative for Beer Brewing**

**1. Introduction**

This control narrative describes the process of brewing beer, with a focus on the lautering stage. The goal of this narrative is to provide a clear and structured set of control criteria for the brewing stages, as well as a detailed explanation of the lautering process. This will help to ensure the reliability and repeatability of the brewing process, and facilitate easy integration into PLC/HMI systems and operator training materials.

**2. Brewing Stages**

The brewing process can be divided into several stages, including mashing, lautering, boiling, fermentation, and packaging. Each stage has its own set of control criteria that must be met in order to produce a high-quality beer.

**2.1 Mashing**

Mashing is the process of converting the starches in the grain into fermentable sugars. The mashing stage typically takes place in a mash tun, and involves heating the grain and water mixture to a specific temperature range (e.g., 65â€“68â€¯Â°C). The mashing stage is important for extracting the maximum amount of fermentable sugars from the grain, and for ensuring that the final beer has the desired flavor and body.

**2.2 Lautering**

Lautering is the process of separating the wort (the liquid containing the fermentable sugars) from the spent grain. The lautering stage typically takes place in a lauter tun, and involves using a rake mechanism to move the grain and wort through the tun. The wort is then transferred to a kettle for boiling, while the spent grain is removed.

**2.3 Boiling**

Boiling is the process of boiling the wort to sterilize it and to concentrate the sugars. The boiling stage typically takes place in a kettle, and involves heating the wort to a specific temperature range (e.g., 75â€“78â€¯Â°C). The boiling stage is important for killing any bacteria or other contaminants that may be present in the wort, and for concentrating the sugars to produce a more flavorful beer.

**2.4 Fermentation**

Fermentation is the process of converting the fermentable sugars into alcohol and carbon dioxide. The fermentation stage typically takes place in a fermentation tank, and involves adding yeast to the wort and allowing it to ferment for a period of time (e.g., 7â€“10 days). The fermentation stage is important for producing the alcohol and carbon dioxide that give beer its characteristic flavor and carbonation.
