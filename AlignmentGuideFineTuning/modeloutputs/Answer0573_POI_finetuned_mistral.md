### Intent:
**Intent Summary:**  
Develop an IEC 61131-3 Structured Text program for feedforward conveyor speed control that proactively adjusts motor speed based on predicted load input, ensuring efficient operation within safe speed limits.

### Prompt:
**Feedforward Control Conveyor:**

Develop a self-contained IEC 61131-3 Structured Text program (not a function block) to implement feedforward control for adjusting the speed of a conveyor belt based on sensor-predicted load changes. The program should use input from sensors that predict the weight or volume of material entering the conveyor system, allowing for real-time adjustments to the belt speed before a load change occurs.

Include logic that calculates the required conveyor speed based on the predicted load and adjusts the motor speed accordingly, ensuring that the conveyor operates efficiently without overloading or underloading. Discuss the benefits of feedforward control in conveyor systems, particularly in reducing delays and improving response times compared to feedback-only control strategies.

ðŸŸ¥ R (Role) â€“ Your Role

â¸»

ðŸŸ© I (Input) â€“ What Youâ€™re Given
	â€¢	Predicted load value from an upstream sensor (e.g., Predicted_Load : REAL)
	â€¢	A base conveyor speed (e.g., Base_Speed := 1.0 m/s)
	â€¢	A feedforward gain (Gain_FF := 0.02) used to scale speed relative to the predicted load
	â€¢	Conveyor system operational limits (e.g., 0.5â€“2.0 m/s)
	â€¢	Conveyor motor controller expects a speed reference (Conveyor_Speed) as output

â¸»

ðŸŸ§ S (Steps) â€“ What You Need to Do
	1.	Read the predicted load input
	â€¢	Capture upstream weight or volume data using a sensor
	2.	Calculate the conveyor speed using feedforward control
	â€¢	Formula: Conveyor_Speed := Base_Speed + Gain_FF * Predicted_Load
	3.	Limit the speed to safe operational bounds
	â€¢	Clamp values to avoid under-speeding or over-speeding:
	â€¢	IF Conveyor_Speed > 2.0 THEN Conveyor_Speed := 2.0
	â€¢	IF Conveyor_Speed < 0.5 THEN Conveyor_Speed := 0.5
	4.	Send the resulting speed to the motor controller

â¸»

ðŸŸ¦ E (Expectation) â€“ What Success Looks Like

Your program will:
	â€¢	Dynamically adjust the conveyor speed based on future material inflow
	â€¢	Improve response time and reduce system lag compared to feedback-only designs
	â€¢	Prevent jams and underloads, maintaining optimal flow and system efficiency
	â€¢	Be modular, readable, and PLC-ready for deployment in real-time industrial environments

    Base_Speed : REAL := 1.0;      // m/s
    Gain_FF : REAL := 0.02;        // speed gain per unit load
    Conveyor_Speed : REAL;

// Calculate conveyor speed based on predicted load
Conveyor_Speed := Base_Speed + Gain_FF * Predicted_Load;

    Description:
    A PLC program in IEC 61131-3 Structured Text that implements feedforward control for a conveyor belt system.

    Features:
    - Uses predicted load input to adjust conveyor speed proactively
    - Calculates speed based on a feedforward gain and base speed
    - Clamps speed to safe operational limits
    - Modular design with clear variable declarations and comments

    Safety Considerations:
    - Ensure predicted load is valid and within expected range
    - Clamping speed prevents over-speeding and under-speeding
    - Test and validate in simulation before deployment
