### Intent:
**Intent Summary:**  
Create a structured I/O list table for feedwater control in a power plant's steam-water cycle, detailing signal names, tag numbers, types (analog/digital), units, ranges, setpoints, and P&ID references to support PLC configuration and instrumentation documentation.  

**Code Generation Intent:**  
Generate a table of I/O signals (e.g., flow, level, valve controls) with metadata for automating feedwater system documentation and control logic implementation.

### Prompt:
**IO List Steam Water Cycle:**

Create an I/O list as a table for feedwater control in a steam-water cycle in a power plant. Have as columns names, signal tagnumber, analog/digital, engineering unit, ranges, setpoint, and P&ID reference.

**R-T-F:**

ðŸŸ¥ R (Role) â€“ Define Your Role

Act as a plant automation engineer preparing signal documentation for the feedwater control system within a steam-water cycle in a power plant.

â¸»

ðŸŸ© T (Task) â€“ Define the Objective

Create a structured I/O list table that includes all key signals involved in feedwater control. For each signal, include the following fields:
	â€¢	Signal Name
	â€¢	Signal Tag Number
	â€¢	Analog/Digital
	â€¢	Engineering Unit
	â€¢	Range
	â€¢	Setpoint
	â€¢	P&ID Reference

Focus on typical elements like flow transmitters, drum level sensors, control valves, and pump interlocks that are critical to regulating feedwater supply.

â¸»

ðŸŸ§ F (Format) â€“ Specify the Output Format

Present the output as a clean and readable table suitable for use in:
	â€¢	PLC configuration
	â€¢	Instrumentation datasheets
	â€¢	Control system documentation
	â€¢	P&ID cross-referencing

Each row should represent a single I/O point and use engineering units, realistic ranges (e.g., 0â€“100%, 0â€“200 t/h), and consistent tagging conventions.
