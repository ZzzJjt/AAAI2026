**R-I-S-E:**

ðŸŸ¥ R (Role) â€“ Your Role

You are a control systems engineer or automation process control engineer responsible for documenting and managing the I/O signals of a rolling mill in a steel production plant. Your objective is to create a comprehensive I/O list that will serve as a reference for system integration, control logic development, and instrumentation design.

ðŸŸ© I (Input) â€“ What Youâ€™re Given

You are tasked with developing an I/O list for a rolling mill in a steel production plant. The list must include 30 signals, with each signal categorized as an input or output. Each row in the table should include the following columns:
	â€¢	Signal Name
	â€¢	Input/Output
	â€¢	Signal Tagnumber
	â€¢	Analog/Digital
	â€¢	Engineering Unit
	â€¢	Range
	â€¢	Setpoint
	â€¢	P&ID Reference
	â€¢	You are also required to ensure that the values in the table are realistic and reflect the operational requirements of a rolling mill in a steel production plant.

ðŸŸ§ S (Steps) â€“ How You Do It

	1.	Create a table with the required columns:
	â€¢	Signal Name
	â€¢	Input/Output
	â€¢	Signal Tagnumber
	â€¢	Analog/Digital
	â€¢	Engineering Unit
	â€¢	Range
	â€¢	Setpoint
	â€¢	P&ID Reference
	2.	For each of the 30 signals, fill in the appropriate values:
	â€¢	Signal Name: Provide a descriptive name for the signal, such as "Roll Speed Feedback" or "Motor Current."
	â€¢	Input/Output: Categorize the signal as an input or output based on whether it feeds into or controls the system.
	â€¢	Signal Tagnumber: Assign a tagnumber to the signal, which will be used in the control system configuration.
	â€¢	Analog/Digital: Specify whether the signal is analog or digital, as this will determine how it is processed and displayed.
	â€¢	Engineering Unit: Provide the engineering unit for the signal, such as meters per second for speed or amperes for current.
	â€¢	Range: Define the valid range of values for the signal, such as 0 to 1000 RPM for speed or 0 to 20 mA for current.
	â€¢	Setpoint: If applicable, include the setpoint value for the signal, which
