ðŸŸ© A (Action)
	â€¢	Define the function block with:
	â€¢	Input: Fahrenheit : REAL
	â€¢	Outputs:
	â€¢	Celsius : REAL
	â€¢	ValidInput : BOOL
	â€¢	Apply input validation:
	â€¢	Reject any input below -459.67Â°F (absolute zero)
	â€¢	Perform the conversion using the formula:
Celsius := (Fahrenheit - 32) \times \frac{5}{9}
	â€¢	Return a valid Celsius result and flag the input as valid or invalid
	â€¢	Add inline comments explaining the formula and input validation logic
