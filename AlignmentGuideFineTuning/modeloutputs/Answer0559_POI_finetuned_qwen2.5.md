### Intent:
**Intent Summary:**  
Develop an IEC 61131-3 Structured Text PID controller for pH regulation that dynamically adjusts acid/base dosing using tuned parameters (Kp, Ki, Kd), enforces output limits, and handles nonlinear process behavior to maintain stability under varying conditions.  

*(Focus: PID logic, safety clamping, and pH-specific challenges in industrial control.)*

### Prompt:
**PID pH Control:**

Develop a self-contained IEC 61131-3 Structured Text program (not a function block) to implement PID feedback control for pH regulation in a process. The program should continuously adjust the addition of acid or base to maintain the pH setpoint, ensuring accurate control in dynamic conditions.

Include the PID parameters (proportional, integral, and derivative gains) and the control logic to handle deviations from the target pH. The program should incorporate safeguards to prevent extreme pH levels by setting operational limits for the dosing mechanism. Discuss the challenges of pH control in industrial processes, particularly focusing on system response time, non-linear behavior of pH control, and maintaining process stability under varying input conditions.

**R-I-S-E:**

â¸»

ðŸŸ§ S (Steps) â€“ What You Need to Do

	3.	Compute derivative: Derivative := (Error - Prev_Error) / 0.1
	4.	Calculate PID output:
Dosing_Output := (Kp * Error) + (Ki * Integral) + (Kd * Derivative)
	5.	Clamp dosing output within safe operating range:
	â€¢	If above Dosing_Max, set to max
	â€¢	If below Dosing_Min, set to min
	6.	Store current error as Prev_Error for the next cycle

â¸»

ðŸŸ¦ E (Expectation) â€“ What You Should Achieve

Your program should:
	â€¢	Maintain stable and accurate pH in a dynamically changing process
	â€¢	Prevent overcorrection and unsafe pH excursions
