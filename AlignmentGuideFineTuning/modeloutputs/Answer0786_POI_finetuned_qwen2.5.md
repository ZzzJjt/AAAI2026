**C-A-R-E:**

ðŸŸ¥ C (Context) â€“ Background Situation

In autonomous transport systems, precise estimation of position and velocity is critical for navigation, obstacle avoidance, and smooth control. However, sensor data is often noisy, and real-time constraints limit the use of complex matrix operations. A Kalman filter can provide robust state estimation under these conditions, but must be adapted for PLC environments where memory, processing power, and scan-cycle timing are limited.

ðŸŸ© A (Action) â€“ Task Steps

	1.	Model the 2-state Kalman filter (position and velocity) with scalar arithmetic.
	2.	Implement the prediction and update steps using the provided noise covariance and time step.
	3.	Include logic to handle reset conditions and reinitialize the filterâ€™s internal state.
	4.	Ensure the function block is self-contained and includes input validation.
	5.	Provide detailed comments explaining the mathematical operations and their significance in real-time state estimation.

ðŸŸ§ R (Result) â€“ Expected Outcome

The result should be a Kalman filter function block in IEC 61131-3 Structured Text that:
	â€¢	Estimates position and velocity from noisy measurements
	â€¢	Accepts configurable noise parameters and initial conditions
	â€¢	Operates efficiently within PLC scan cycles using scalar arithmetic
	â€¢	Includes detailed comments for clarity and maintainability
	â€¢	Works reliably in real-time control applications, such as autonomous transport systems
