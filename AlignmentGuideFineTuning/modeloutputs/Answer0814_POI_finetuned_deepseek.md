### Intent:
The task is to implement a steel quality monitoring system in Python that simulates manufacturing process data with controlled drift to test statistical process control methods.

### Prompt:
**Model Predictive Control for Aircraft Trajectory Using MATLAB:**

Develop MATLAB code to implement a model predictive control (MPC) algorithm for optimizing the trajectory of an aircraft. Ensure that the control scheme accounts for dynamic constraints, fuel efficiency, and external disturbances, while maintaining flight safety and performance objectives.

**T-A-G:**

ðŸŸ¥ Tï¼ˆTaskï¼‰

Implement a model predictive control (MPC) system in MATLAB to optimize the flight trajectory of an aircraft.

ðŸŸ© Aï¼ˆActionï¼‰

Develop a mathematical model of the aircraftâ€™s dynamics and use it within an MPC framework. Incorporate constraints related to control inputs and aircraft performance, account for external disturbances such as wind, and include objectives for fuel efficiency and flight safety. Simulate realistic flight scenarios to test and validate the controllerâ€™s performance.

ðŸŸ¦ Gï¼ˆGoalï¼‰

Achieve robust and efficient trajectory tracking that adapts to disturbances, minimizes fuel consumption, and maintains safe, optimal flight paths under dynamic operating conditions.
