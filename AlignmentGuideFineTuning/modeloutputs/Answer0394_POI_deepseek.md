### Intent:
**Intent Summary:**  
Create an ASCII art function block diagram showing an analog input feeding both a timer and PID controller, with the PID output connected to an analog output, for industrial process control documentation.

### Prompt:
**FBD PID:**

Create a 61131-3 function block diagram in ASCII art. It shall contain an analog input, a timer block, and a PID block as well as an analog output. The analog input feeds both the timer and the PID block. Only the PID block is connected to the analog output. Provide typical input and output signals for each function block and show them inside each block.

**C-A-R-E:**

ðŸŸ¥ C (Context) â€“ Background Situation

When designing control systems using IEC 61131-3 Function Block Diagrams (FBD), itâ€™s often helpful to communicate the layout using ASCII art in documentation, code comments, or plain text environments where graphical tools arenâ€™t available. A basic structure involving an analog input, timer, PID controller, and analog output is a common pattern in automation and control logic design.

ðŸŸ© A (Action) â€“ Task to Perform

Create an ASCII-based FBD diagram that includes:
	â€¢	An analog input block
	â€¢	A TON (on-delay) timer block
	â€¢	A PID control block
	â€¢	An analog output block

The analog input should feed both the timer and the PID controller, and only the PID block should be connected to the analog output. Inside each block, show the typical signal names for the inputs and outputs (e.g., IN, ET, PV, SP, CV, OUT, etc.).

â¸»

ðŸŸ¨ R (Result) â€“ Expected Outcome

You will produce a text-based representation of a function block diagram that clearly illustrates the signal flow, block interconnections, and naming conventions used in PLC programming. This will help engineers document control strategies, review logic, and share designs without the need for graphics software.

In this example, the AnalogInput block receives an analog signal (AI) and feeds both the TON block and the PID block. The TON block has a delay time of 50 milliseconds (ET), and its output (ET) is connected to the PID block. The PID block processes the process variable (PV=AI) and calculates the setpoint (SP=50.0), control value (CV), and output (OUT=CV). The AnalogOut block receives the control value (CV) and sends it to the analog output.
