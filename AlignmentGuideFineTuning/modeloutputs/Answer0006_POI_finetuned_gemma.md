### Intent:
The task involves implementing a statistical process control (SPC) system in Python to monitor and maintain steel manufacturing quality by tracking thickness, tensile strength, and surface roughness using X-bar and R control charts with automated alarm triggers and corrective action suggestions.

### Prompt:
**Model Predictive Control for HVAC System Optimization Using C++:**

Develop C++ code to implement a model predictive control (MPC) algorithm for optimizing the performance of a Heating, Ventilation, and Air Conditioning (HVAC) system. The control system should manage temperature, humidity, and energy consumption while maintaining occupant comfort. It must consider dynamic constraints such as varying external temperatures, occupancy levels, and energy efficiency requirements, ensuring optimal control under changing environmental conditions.

Implement C++ code to simulate the HVAC systemâ€™s dynamics, and demonstrate how MPC can optimize energy usage, response time, and system performance while adhering to operational constraints.

**B-A-B:**

ðŸŸ¥ Bï¼ˆBeforeï¼‰

Conventional HVAC control methods often struggle to maintain occupant comfort while minimizing energy consumption, especially under fluctuating external temperatures, varying occupancy levels, and dynamic environmental conditions. These methods lack foresight and adaptability, leading to inefficient energy usage and delayed system responses.

ðŸŸ© Aï¼ˆAfterï¼‰

Use model predictive control (MPC) to implement a smart HVAC management system in C++ that proactively adjusts temperature and humidity settings. The system should optimize energy consumption and maintain occupant comfort by forecasting environmental changes and responding efficiently to dynamic constraints.

ðŸŸ§ Bï¼ˆBridgeï¼‰

Develop C++ code to simulate HVAC system dynamics, including variables like indoor temperature, humidity, occupancy, and external weather. Then, implement an MPC algorithm that continuously optimizes control decisions based on predictive models and real-time constraints, demonstrating improvements in energy efficiency, responsiveness, and environmental adaptability.
