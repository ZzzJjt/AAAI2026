### Intent:
**Intent Summary:**  
Create a standardized control narrative for beer brewing automation, specifying setpoints, instrumentation, and step-by-step lautering logic (including equipment, sensors, and conditional actions like turbidity-based flow diversion).  

*(Focus: Documentation for PLC/DCS implementation with precise parameters and procedural clarity.)*

### Prompt:
**Control Narrative Beer Brewing:**

Create a control narrative for beer brewing including concrete setpoints and ranges.

Create a detailed explanation of the Lautering process (Section 4). Include the equipment and instrumentation needed. Provide a list of the steps to execute.

**B-A-B:**

ðŸŸ¥ B (Before) â€“ The Problem or Challenge

In brewery automation projects, engineers often lack standardized documentation for complex processes like beer brewing. Without a well-structured control narrative, itâ€™s difficult to define setpoints, control logic, and instrumentation for each phaseâ€”especially for stages like lautering, which involve precise timing, flow control, and mechanical coordination. Inconsistent or vague narratives can lead to inefficiencies or errors during automation design or commissioning.

ðŸŸ© A (After) â€“ The Desired Outcome

Develop a comprehensive control narrative for the beer brewing process, including:
	â€¢	Clear setpoints and acceptable operating ranges for key parameters (e.g., temperature, flow, timing)
	â€¢	A focused explanation of the lautering process (Section 4), covering:
	â€¢	Required equipment and instrumentation (e.g., lauter tun, rake system, flow transmitters)
	â€¢	Step-by-step procedure for lautering
	â€¢	Relevant automation logic or decision conditions

â¸»

ðŸŸ§ B (Bridge) â€“ How to Get There
	1.	Begin by outlining the overall brewing process with specific control points, such as:
	â€¢	Mash temperature: 65â€“68â€¯Â°C
	â€¢	Sparge water temperature: 75â€“78â€¯Â°C
	â€¢	Lautering flow rate: 1.5â€“2.0 L/min
	â€¢	Holding tank level: 50â€“80%
	2.	In Section 4 (Lautering):
	â€¢	Describe the physical components: lauter tun, rake motor, underlet system, flowmeters
	â€¢	List instrumentation: temperature sensors, turbidity sensors, level transmitters
	â€¢	Step-by-step control logic, including:
	â€¢	Rake arm position control
	â€¢	Flow ramp-up sequence
	â€¢	Turbidity-based decision to stop lautering
	3.	Include control logic like:
	â€¢	IF turbidity > threshold THEN divert flow to waste
	â€¢	IF level < min THEN stop sparge water
	4.	Use structured formatting and bullet points or numbered steps for clarity

Use this control narrative as a reference for designing and documenting the automation system for beer brewing, ensuring that all stages are clearly defined and that engineers have a complete understanding of the brewing process and its control requirements.

**R-I-S-E:**

ðŸŸ¥ R (Role) â€“ Your Role

You are a control systems engineer or automation process designer responsible for documenting the brewing process, including the Lautering phase, for a brewery automation system. Your goal is to create a control narrative that clearly outlines setpoints, instrumentation, and process logic for each phase of beer brewing.

ðŸŸ© I (Input) â€“ What Youâ€™re Given

You are provided with:
	â€¢	A basic understanding of the beer brewing process
	â€¢	Concrete setpoints and acceptable ranges for key brewing parameters
	â€¢	An empty control narrative structure to fill in
	â€¢	A focus on Section 4: Lautering, which includes:
	â€¢	Required equipment and instrumentation
	â€¢	A detailed explanation of the lautering process
	â€¢	Control logic for managing the lautering phase
