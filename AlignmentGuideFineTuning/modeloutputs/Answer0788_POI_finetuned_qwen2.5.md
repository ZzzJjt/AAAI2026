**C-A-R-E:**

ðŸŸ¥ C (Context) â€“ Background Situation

Sorting algorithms like quicksort are essential for many industrial applications, but their recursive nature can lead to stack overflows in PLC environments. A scan-safe, iterative quicksort function block is needed to ensure reliable execution within the constraints of PLC scan cycles.

â¸»

ðŸŸ© A (Action) â€“ Steps to Perform

	1.	Define the function block with inputs and outputs:
	â€¢	InputArray : ARRAY[1..N] OF INT
	â€¢	Execute : BOOL
	â€¢	SortedArray : ARRAY[1..N] OF INT (optional)
	â€¢	Done : BOOL
	â€¢	Busy : BOOL
	2.	Implement the quicksort algorithm using an iterative approach with a manually managed stack:
	â€¢	Use two arrays (LowStack and HighStack) to simulate the call stack.
	â€¢	Replace recursive calls with iterative loops that manage subarray indices.
	â€¢	Implement the partitioning logic (e.g., Lomuto or Hoare) to place the pivot in its correct position.
	3.	Manage the sorting process with status flags:
	â€¢	Execute : BOOL â€” triggers the start of the sorting process.
	â€¢	Busy : BOOL â€” indicates whether the function block is currently sorting.
	â€¢	Done : BOOL â€” signals when the sorting is complete.
	4.	Ensure scan-cycle safety:
	â€¢	Limit the number of iterations to prevent scan-cycle timeouts.
	â€¢	Implement efficient memory management to avoid buffer overflows.
	â€¢	Add comments explaining the logic, partitioning, and status handling.

ðŸŸ§ R (Result) â€“ Expected Outcome

The function block will:
	â€¢	Sort an input array of integers in place using an iterative quicksort algorithm.
	â€¢	Replace recursive calls with a manually managed stack to prevent stack overflows.
	â€¢	Provide status flags (Execute, Busy, Done) to indicate the current state of the sorting process.
	â€¢	Be scan-safe and efficient, ensuring reliable execution within PLC scan cycles.
