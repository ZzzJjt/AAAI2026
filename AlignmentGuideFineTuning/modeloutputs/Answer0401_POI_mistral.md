### Intent:
The task involves implementing an MPC controller in Python to optimize a two-stage batch chemical process with time delays, ensuring stable tank levels while responding to fluctuating demand forecasts.

### Prompt:
**Artificial Neural Network Control for Temperature Regulation in a Chemical Reactor Using Python:**

**Origin**

Develop Python code to implement an artificial neural network (ANN) for advanced process control of the temperature in a chemical reactor. The control system should leverage the predictive and adaptive capabilities of ANNs to manage the reactorâ€™s temperature, considering the nonlinear and time-varying nature of the reactorâ€™s dynamics. Train the ANN using historical process data to optimize temperature control, ensuring stability and efficiency under varying operational conditions.

Implement Python code to simulate the chemical reactorâ€™s temperature control dynamics and demonstrate how ANN-based control can outperform traditional methods in handling complex, nonlinear systems.

**R-I-S-E**

**Implementation**

1. Import necessary libraries and load the historical dataset.

```python
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from sklearn.neural_network import MLPRegressor
from scipy.integrate import odeint

# Load historical data
data = pd.read_csv('historical_data.csv')
```

2. Preprocess the data and split it into training and testing sets.

```python
# Preprocess data
X_train = data.iloc[:int(0.8 * len(data)), :].values
y_train = data.iloc[:int(0.8 * len(data)), 1].values
X_test = data.iloc[int(0.8 * len(data)):, :].values
y_test = data.iloc[int(0.8 * len(data)):, 1].values

# Normalize the data
X_train = (X_train - np.min(X_train, axis=0)) / (np.max(X_train, axis=0) - np.min(X_train, axis=0))
X_test = (X_test - np.min(X_test, axis=0)) / (np.max(X_test, axis=0) - np.min(X_test, axis=0))
y_train = (y_train - np.min(y_train)) / (np.max(y_train) - np.min(y_train))
y_test = (y_test - np.min(y_test)) / (np.max(y_test) - np.min(y_test))
```

3. Define the ANN model and train it on the training data.

```python
# Define ANN model
ann = MLPRegressor(hidden_layer_sizes=(100, 50), max_iter=1000, solver='lbfgs', learning_rate_init=0.001)
ann.fit(X_train, y_train)
```

4. Implement the ANN-based controller for temperature
