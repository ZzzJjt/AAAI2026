### Intent:
"Implement a 2:1 ratio control system in Structured Text that dynamically adjusts Reactant B's flow rate to maintain the specified ratio with Reactant A, including input validation, error monitoring, and safety constraints."

### Prompt:
**Ratio Control Mixing:**

Develop a self-contained IEC 61131-3 Structured Text program (not a function block) to implement ratio control for mixing two reactants in a 2:1 ratio. The program should maintain the desired ratio between the two reactants by adjusting their flow rates dynamically, ensuring that for every two parts of reactant A, one part of reactant B is added.

Include logic to monitor the flow rates of both reactants and adjust one flow rate relative to the other to maintain the 2:1 ratio. The program should also handle any disturbances or variations in flow, adjusting the control signals to correct for deviations from the target ratio. Discuss the importance of ratio control in maintaining the desired chemical composition and the impact of disturbances on the mixing process.

	1.	Continuously monitors the flow rates of reactant A and reactant B
	2.	Calculates the actual A:B ratio
	3.	Determines the setpoint for flow B to maintain the 2:1 ratio:
Flow_B_SP := Flow_A_PV / 2.0
	4.	Compares the actual ratio with the desired ratio and calculates an error margin

The output should be a clean IEC 61131-3 Structured Text code block like this:

VAR
    Flow_A_PV : REAL;                 // Measured flow rate of Reactant A
    Flow_B_PV : REAL;                 // Measured flow rate of Reactant B
    Flow_B_SP : REAL;                 // Setpoint for Reactant B (output)

    Ratio_Setpoint : REAL := 2.0;     // Desired ratio A:B = 2:1
    Actual_Ratio : REAL;
    Error : REAL;
    Tolerance : REAL := 0.05;         // Allowable deviation
END_VAR

// Calculate actual ratio (A:B)
IF Flow_B_PV > 0.0 THEN
    Actual_Ratio := Flow_A_PV / Flow_B_PV;
ELSE
    Actual_Ratio := 0.0;
END_IF

// Compute required flow setpoint for Reactant B
Flow_B_SP := Flow_A_PV / Ratio_Setpoint;

// Optional: Calculate ratio error for monitoring
Error := Actual_Ratio - Ratio_Setpoint;
IF ABS(Error) > Tolerance THEN
    // Raise alarm, activate flag, or correct with fallback logic
END_IF

**Explanation:**

Ratio control is a critical aspect of chemical processes, ensuring that the desired chemical composition is maintained. Deviations from the target ratio can lead to undesired side reactions, product degradation, or safety hazards.

In this task, you are asked to implement a ratio control system in Structured Text that adjusts the flow rate of Reactant B to maintain a 2:1 ratio with Reactant A. The program continuously monitors the flow rates of both reactants, calculates the actual ratio, and adjusts the flow rate of Reactant B to maintain the desired ratio.

The program also includes an optional tolerance check, which flags when the system deviates from the required ratio. This feature can be useful for monitoring and troubleshooting purposes.

The importance of ratio control in maintaining the desired chemical composition cannot be overstated. By implementing this control system, you ensure that the mixing process produces the correct product and minimizes the risk of safety hazards.
