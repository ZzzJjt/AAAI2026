🟧 S (Steps) – Implementation Steps
	1.	Identify 30 key control and monitoring signals commonly used in rolling mills.
	2.	For each signal, define:
	•	Whether it is an input (sensor) or output (actuator)
	•	Its analog/digital type
	•	Engineering units (e.g., mm, °C, bar, m/min)
	•	Typical range and control setpoint
	•	A unique tag number (e.g., RM1001)
	•	P&ID reference for traceability
	3.	Format the list as a structured table suitable for use in Excel, documentation, or PLC tag import.
	4.	Ensure consistency, clarity, and relevance to real plant instrumentation.

⸻

🟦 E (Expectation) – Expected Outcome

Deliver a professional, standardized I/O list that:
	•	Covers 30 essential signals used in rolling mill operations
	•	Provides all necessary metadata for PLC configuration, field wiring, and HMI integration
	•	Aligns with best practices for project documentation, P&ID traceability, and commissioning support
