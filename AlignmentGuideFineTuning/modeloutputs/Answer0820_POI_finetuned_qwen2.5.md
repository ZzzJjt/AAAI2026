### Intent:
**Intent Summary:**  
Develop a 6-DOF aircraft dynamics model in MATLAB to simulate position, velocity, and attitude responses to thrust and control surface inputs, incorporating aerodynamic forces and wind disturbances for flight control applications.  

*(Focus: Aircraft simulation for control system design, with states, inputs, and aerodynamics explicitly modeled.)*

### Prompt:
**Statistical Process Control for Steel Manufacturing Using Python:**

Develop Python code to implement a statistical process control (SPC) system for monitoring and optimizing the quality of steel manufacturing processes. The code should track key quality metrics such as tensile strength, thickness, and surface finish in real-time, using control charts and other SPC tools to detect and respond to process variations. Implement alarms for out-of-control conditions, and suggest corrective actions to minimize defects and ensure product consistency.

Simulate the steel manufacturing process, and demonstrate how SPC can be used to maintain high-quality production standards while minimizing waste and process variability.

**Before:**

In steel manufacturing, quality control is often reactive, relying on manual inspection and batch-level analysis. This approach is inefficient, prone to delays, and lacks real-time responsiveness to process variations.

â¸»

**After:**

Implement Python-based SPC tools to monitor key quality metrics such as tensile strength, thickness, and surface finish in real time. Use XÌ„ and R charts to detect process deviations, trigger alarms for out-of-control conditions, and recommend corrective actions to minimize defects and ensure product consistency. Simulate the steel manufacturing process to demonstrate how SPC can maintain high-quality production standards while minimizing waste and process variability.

â¸»

**Bridge:**

Use Python to build a statistical process control (SPC) system that proactively monitors and controls quality in steel manufacturing, ensuring high standards and reducing waste.

â¸»

**Example:**

Simulate a steel manufacturing process where tensile strength, thickness, and surface finish are measured in real time. Implement SPC tools to track these metrics using XÌ„ and R charts. When a process deviation is detected, trigger an alarm and suggest corrective actions to adjust the process parameters. Simulate the impact of SPC on maintaining high-quality production standards.
