ðŸŸ© A (Action)
	â€¢	Implement a discrete-time, 2-state Kalman filter using only scalar arithmetic, avoiding matrix operations or recursion
	â€¢	Accept configurable inputs:
	â€¢	MeasuredPosition : REAL
	â€¢	Q : REAL â€“ process noise covariance
	â€¢	R : REAL â€“ measurement noise covariance
	â€¢	DeltaT : REAL â€“ sample time
	â€¢	Reset : BOOL â€“ to reinitialize state
	â€¢	Internally manage variables for:
	â€¢	Estimated position and velocity
	â€¢	Previous position (for velocity update)
	â€¢	Error covariance and Kalman gain
	â€¢	Perform prediction and update steps each scan cycle
	â€¢	Add clear comments for each stage of the algorithm to support maintainability and clarity

ðŸŸ¦ G (Goal)

Deliver a modular, scan-cycle-safe function block that produces reliable estimates of position and velocity despite measurement noise. The block should be easy to configure, integrate into motion control logic, and adaptable for various autonomous or mobile platform applications. 

**Example Use Case:**
In a motion control system for an autonomous vehicle, the Kalman filter block receives noisy position measurements from an encoder and uses the Kalman filter to estimate the vehicle's true position and velocity. The estimated values are then used to control the vehicle's motion, ensuring smooth and accurate navigation.

**Note:** The provided code snippet is a starting point for the implementation. The actual implementation will require additional code to handle the prediction and update steps of the Kalman filter, as well as the initialization and reset logic. The code should be thoroughly tested to ensure that it produces accurate estimates of position and velocity despite measurement noise. The implementation should also be optimized for performance and memory usage to ensure that it can be used in real-time motion control applications.
