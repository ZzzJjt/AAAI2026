### Intent:
**Intent Summary:**  
Design an IEC 61131-3 Sequential Function Chart (SFC) in ASCII art for a cyclic traffic light system with timed steps (Green: 5s â†’ Yellow: 2s â†’ Red: 5s) and conditional transitions, ensuring looped operation for documentation or logic planning.

### Prompt:
**SFC Traffic Light:**

Create a 61131-3 sequential function chart in ASCII art for a traffic light. Include proper delays for switching the lights.

**T-A-G:**

ðŸŸ¥ T (Task)

Design a Sequential Function Chart (SFC) using ASCII art for a traffic light system based on IEC 61131-3.

â¸»

ðŸŸ© A (Action)
	â€¢	Define three sequential steps: Green, Yellow, and Red.
	â€¢	Assign a TON (on-delay) timer to each step to implement timed delays:
	â€¢	Green: 5 seconds
	â€¢	Yellow: 2 seconds
	â€¢	Red: 5 seconds
	â€¢	Use ASCII characters to format the SFC with clearly labeled steps and transitions.
	â€¢	Represent the transitions using conditions like tGreen.Q, tYellow.Q, and tRed.Q to move from one step to the next.
	â€¢	Loop the final step (Red) back to Green to complete the cycle.

â¸»

ðŸŸ¦ G (Goal)

Create a readable and logically accurate SFC diagram in text format that visually represents the sequence and timing logic of a traffic light. This diagram should help in:
	â€¢	Control logic planning
	â€¢	IEC 61131-3 structured programming
	â€¢	Training or documentation where graphic tools are unavailable

```

ðŸŸ¦ G (Goal)

The SFC diagram above represents the cyclic operation of the traffic light system. The transitions between the steps are controlled by the conditions tGreen.Q, tYellow.Q, and tRed.Q.

ðŸŸ© A (Action)

To implement the conditions for transitioning between steps, we can use the following logic:

```
tGreen.Q = NOT tYellow.Q AND NOT tRed.Q AND tGreen.T > 5000ms
tYellow.Q = NOT tRed.Q AND tYellow.T > 2000ms
tRed.Q = NOT tGreen.Q
```

ðŸŸ¥ T (Task)

Now that we have the SFC diagram and the conditions for transitioning between steps, we can implement this logic in a PLC programming environment like Siemens Step 7, Rockwell RSLogix 5000, or Omron CX-Programmer.

ðŸŸ¦ G (Goal)

With the SFC diagram and conditions in place, we have a clear understanding of the traffic light system's operation and can proceed to implement it in a PLC programming environment. This documentation will serve as a useful reference for control logic planning, training, and future maintenance.
