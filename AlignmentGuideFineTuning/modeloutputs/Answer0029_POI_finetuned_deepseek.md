### Intent:
**Intent Summary:**  
Create a structured text function block to automate Profibus DP slave diagnostics, including status monitoring, error retrieval, and communication health checks, with robust error handling for real-time PLC integration.

### Prompt:
**Profibus DP Diagnostics Using 61131-3 Structured Text:**

Develop a self-contained 61131-3 structured text function block to read diagnostic data from a Profibus DP slave device. The function block should handle communication with the Profibus DP slave and retrieve diagnostic information such as device status, error codes, and communication health. Provide an explanation of the key steps in processing the diagnostic data, including request initiation, data retrieval, and error handling mechanisms.

**B-A-B:**

ðŸŸ¥ B (Before) â€“ The Challenge

In many industrial environments, maintaining reliable Profibus DP communication is critical. However, accessing diagnostic data from Profibus DP slave devices is often manual or vendor-specific, making it difficult to monitor device health, detect errors early, or respond to communication failures in real time from within standard PLC logic.

â¸»

ðŸŸ© A (After) â€“ The Ideal Outcome

Develop a self-contained IEC 61131-3 Structured Text (ST) function block that enables PLC programs to automatically retrieve diagnostic information from a Profibus DP slave. This function block should communicate with the slave device to gather data such as device status, error codes, and communication health, and expose the information for monitoring or control logic.

â¸»

ðŸŸ§ B (Bridge) â€“ The Implementation Strategy

Design the function block to initiate a diagnostic request to a Profibus DP slave cyclically or on demand. Use input parameters to trigger the request and select the slave address. Internally, implement logic to:
	â€¢	Start the request based on a rising edge of an Execute signal
	â€¢	Communicate with the Profibus interface to retrieve the diagnostic buffer
	â€¢	Parse key elements such as module status, communication errors, and device fault codes
	â€¢	Map this information to structured outputs for controller-level monitoring

Include error detection (e.g., timeout, invalid response) and provide output flags such as Done, Error, and ErrorID to allow the main program to handle failures appropriately.
