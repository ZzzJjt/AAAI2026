For each subsection:
	â€¢	Provide a detailed explanation of the control strategy
	â€¢	Define the target values, such as temperature range or pH band
	â€¢	Describe the equipment involved, control actions, and feedback mechanisms
	â€¢	Write each explanation in one paragraph per subsection

Include mentions of interlocks, alarms, and control system responses to deviations.

ðŸŸ§ F (Format) â€“ Specify the Output Format

Produce:
	â€¢	A written control narrative document
	â€¢	Section 3: Fermentation, structured as multiple one-paragraph subsections (e.g., 3.1, 3.2, 3.3â€¦)
	â€¢	Each paragraph should contain:
	â€¢	The control objective
	â€¢	Setpoints/ranges (e.g., 32â€“35â€¯Â°C, pH 4.5â€“5.0)

**Process Overview**

**1. Raw Material Preparation**

The raw material preparation phase involves the following steps:
	â€¢	Raw material storage
	â€¢	Raw material preparation
	â€¢	Raw material transfer

**1.1 Raw Material Storage**

The raw material storage area is equipped with tanks for storing the raw materials. The tanks are equipped with level sensors to monitor the level of the raw materials. The level sensors are connected to a control system that monitors the level of the raw materials and alerts the operator if the level falls below a certain threshold.

**1.2 Raw Material Preparation**

The raw material preparation area is equipped with a mixer and a pump. The mixer is used to mix the raw materials and the pump is used to transfer the mixed raw materials to the fermentation tanks. The mixer is equipped with a temperature sensor to monitor the temperature of the raw materials. The temperature sensor is connected to a control system that monitors the temperature of the raw materials and alerts the operator if the temperature falls below a certain threshold.

**1.3 Raw Material Transfer**

The raw material transfer area is equipped with a pump and a valve. The pump is used to transfer the mixed raw materials from the mixer to the fermentation tanks. The valve is used to control the flow of the mixed raw materials to the fermentation tanks. The pump and valve are connected to a control system that monitors the flow of the mixed raw materials and alerts the operator if the flow falls below a certain threshold.

**2. Fermentation**

The fermentation phase involves the following steps:
	â€¢	Fermentation
	â€¢	Distillation
	â€¢	Purification

**2.1 Fermentation**

The fermentation phase is the most important phase in the ethanol production process. The fermentation phase is where the raw materials are converted into ethanol. The fermentation phase is carried out in fermentation tanks. The fermentation tanks are equipped with temperature sensors, pH sensors, and oxygen sensors. The temperature sensors are used to monitor the temperature of the fermentation tanks. The pH sensors are used to monitor the pH of the fermentation tanks. The oxygen sensors are used to monitor the oxygen level of the fermentation tanks. The temperature sensors, pH sensors, and oxygen sensors are connected to
