**Steps to Implement:**

1. Define the robot's motion model (e.g., kinematic or dynamic model) using Python.
2. Implement the MPC algorithm with prediction and constraint handling.
3. Integrate obstacle detection and avoidance logic.
4. Develop simulation examples demonstrating real-time adaptation and smooth trajectory control.
5. Document the code and provide clear instructions for running the simulations.

**Deliverables:**

1. Python script implementing the MPC algorithm for robot motion optimization.
2. Documentation of the code and simulation examples.
3. Instructions for running the simulations.

**Evaluation Criteria:**

1. Code quality and organization.
2. Implementation of the MPC algorithm with prediction and constraint handling.
3. Integration of obstacle detection and avoidance logic.
4. Smoothness and efficiency of the robot's movement in dynamic environments.
5. Real-time adaptation to changing conditions.
6. Documentation and clarity of instructions.

**Notes:**

1. You may use any libraries or tools to help with the implementation, but ensure they are well-documented and easily accessible.
2. The robot's motion model can be simplified for the purpose of this exercise, but it should still capture the essential dynamics of the robot.
3. The obstacle detection and avoidance logic can be based on simple assumptions or existing libraries, but it should be adaptable to real-world scenarios.
4. The simulation examples should demonstrate the effectiveness of the MPC algorithm in various scenarios, including dynamic environments and obstacle avoidance.
5. The code should be modular and easy to extend for future improvements or modifications.
6. The output can be in the form of logs or optional visual plots to help demonstrate the robot's movement.

**Good luck!**
