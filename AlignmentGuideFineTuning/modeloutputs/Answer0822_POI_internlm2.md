### Intent:
**Intent Summary:**  
Create an IEC 61131-3 Structured Text function block to monitor and log real-time communication status (OPC UA, Modbus, Profinet), trigger alarms on failures, and record diagnostic details for troubleshooting.  

*(Focus: Protocol-agnostic monitoring, fault logging, and real-time alerting.)*

### Prompt:
**Communication Monitoring for OPC UA, Modbus, and Profinet Using IEC 61131-3 Structured Text:**

Develop a function block in structured text (ST) as per IEC 61131-3 standards to monitor communication connections to an OPC UA server, Modbus server, and Profinet in a machine system. The function block should continuously check the connection status of each protocol, and if any connection fails, an alarm should be triggered. Additionally, when a connection is lost, an entry must be created in the audit trail, detailing the reason for the server being down along with the corresponding error code. Discuss the implementation logic for monitoring multiple protocols, error detection, and how to effectively manage and log communication failures for real-time monitoring and troubleshooting.

**T-A-G:**

ðŸŸ¥ T (Task) â€“ What You Need to Do

Create an IEC 61131-3 Structured Text (ST) function block to monitor communication status for OPC UA, Modbus, and Profinet protocols within a machine control system.

ðŸŸ© A (Action) â€“ How to Do It

Develop logic that continuously checks the connection status of each protocol. If any connection fails, the function block should raise an alarm and generate an audit trail entry containing the protocol name, reason for the failure, and an associated error code. The block should handle each protocol independently and include mechanisms for error detection, alarm handling, and memory-safe logging.

ðŸŸ¦ G (Goal) â€“ What You Aim to Achieve

Ensure robust, real-time communication monitoring and fault diagnostics for all three protocols, enabling operators and maintenance teams to quickly identify, respond to, and trace communication failuresâ€”thus improving system uptime and traceability.

**Implementation Details:**

1. **Protocol-Specific Monitoring:**
   - **OPC UA:** Use the OPC UA client library to establish a connection and periodically check the status. If the connection is lost, log the event and raise an alarm.
   - **Modbus:** Utilize a Modbus client library to establish a connection and monitor the status. If the connection is lost, log the event and raise an alarm.
   - **Profinet:** Employ a Profinet client library to establish a connection and monitor the status. If the connection is lost, log the event and raise an alarm.

2. **Error Detection:**
   - Implement error handling for each protocol, capturing and logging the specific error codes returned by the respective libraries.
   - Use try-catch blocks to handle exceptions and ensure the function block does not crash when an error occurs.

3. **Alarm Handling:**
   - Define an alarm output for each protocol, which is set to true when a connection is lost.
   - Implement a timer to reset the alarm after a certain period of time (e.g., 5 minutes) if the connection is re-established.

4. **Audit Trail Logging:**
   - Create a data structure to store the audit trail entries, including the protocol name, timestamp, reason for the failure, and error code.
   - Implement a logging function that appends new entries to the audit trail data structure.
   - Use a file system or a database to persist the audit trail data for later analysis.

5. **Memory-Safe Logging:**
   - Ensure that the logging function is memory-safe by using a circular buffer or a similar data structure to store the audit trail entries.
   - Implement a mechanism to periodically flush the buffer to disk or a database to prevent memory overflow.

6. **Real-Time Monitoring:**
   - Use a timer to periodically check the connection status for each protocol (e.g., every 5 seconds).
   - Implement a mechanism to update the alarm and audit trail in real-time as the connection status changes.

7. **Troubleshooting:**
   - Include detailed error messages in the audit trail entries to help diagnose the root cause of communication failures.
   - Provide a user interface or a web-based dashboard to visualize the real-time monitoring data and audit trail entries, allowing operators and maintenance teams to quickly identify and respond to issues.

**Conclusion:**

By implementing a function block in IEC 61131-3 Structured Text that monitors and
