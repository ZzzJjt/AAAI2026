	â€¢	0x01: Read Coils

	â€¢	0x0F: Write Multiple Coils
	â€¢	0x10: Write Multiple Registers
	â€¢	0x17: Read/Write Multiple Registers

You also need to explain the logic for the ReadCoils methodâ€”how it processes incoming requests, maps coil data, and handles communication over TCP/IP.

ðŸŸ§ S (Steps) â€“ What You Need to Do

	1.	Design a Structured Text function block with internal connection management to support up to 10 simultaneous Modbus TCP clients.
	2.	Implement request routing logic that identifies the Modbus function code and dispatches to the appropriate handler (e.g., ReadCoils, WriteSingleRegister).
	3.	In the ReadCoils method:
	â€¢	Parse the starting address and quantity of coils from the client request
	â€¢	Access the internal coil data buffer
	â€¢	Format and return the response according to the Modbus TCP protocol
	â€¢	Handle edge cases like invalid requests or timeouts gracefully
	4.	Implement a loop or connection pool to handle each client independently without blocking others, ensuring robust and scalable performance.

ðŸŸ¦ E (Expectation) â€“ What Success Looks Like

The function block should allow up to 10 clients to connect and communicate with the Modbus server in parallel, each receiving fast, correct responses to standard Modbus requests. The ReadCoils method and other function code handlers should work reliably under load, with appropriate error reporting and protocol complianceâ€”providing a high-performance communication layer for real-world automation systems.

ðŸŸ¦ E (Expectation) â€“ What Success Looks Like

The function block should allow up to 10 clients to connect and communicate with the Modbus server in parallel, each receiving fast, correct responses to standard Modbus requests. The ReadCoils method and other function code handlers should work reliably under load, with appropriate error reporting and protocol complianceâ€”providing a high-performance communication layer for real-world automation systems.

**Modbus Server for Parallel Client Connections using 61131-3 Structured Text:**

**ReadCoils Method:**

The ReadCoils method is responsible for processing client requests to read a range of coils from the Modbus server. The method must parse the starting address and quantity of coils from the client request, access the internal coil data buffer, and format and return the response according to the Modbus TCP protocol.

The method should also handle edge cases like invalid requests or timeouts gracefully, ensuring robust and scalable performance.

**Request Routing:**

The Modbus server must implement request routing logic that identifies the Modbus function code and dispatches to the appropriate handler (e.g., ReadCoils, WriteSingleRegister). This logic should be implemented in a way that is scalable and efficient, allowing the server to handle multiple client requests simultaneously.

**Connection Management:**

The Modbus server must also implement internal connection management to support up to 10 simultaneous Modbus TCP clients. This may involve using a loop or connection pool to handle each client independently without blocking others.

**Protocol Compliance:**

The Modbus server must comply with the Modbus TCP protocol, ensuring that all requests and responses are formatted correctly and that the server can communicate with a wide range of Modbus clients.

**Error Handling:**

The Modbus server must handle errors gracefully, reporting any issues to the client and taking appropriate action to ensure that the server remains operational. This may involve retrying requests or shutting down the server in the event of a critical error.

**Performance:**

The Modbus server must be able to handle multiple client requests simultaneously, with fast response times and low latency. This may involve optimizing the code to minimize processing time and ensuring that the server can handle a high volume of requests without becoming overloaded.

**Scalability:**

The Modbus server must be scalable, allowing it to handle a growing number of clients and requests over time. This may involve using a connection pool or other techniques to ensure that the server can handle a high volume of requests without becoming overloaded.

**Reliability:**

The Modbus server must be reliable, with minimal downtime and a high level of availability. This may involve using redundancy or other techniques to ensure that the server can continue to operate even in the event of a failure.

**Security:**

The Modbus server must be secure, with appropriate measures in place to protect against unauthorized access and malicious attacks. This may involve using encryption or other techniques to ensure that
