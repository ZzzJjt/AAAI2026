### Intent:
**Intent Summary:**  
Create a reusable IEC 61131-3 function block in Structured Text to compare two REAL values with configurable decimal precision, including error handling and relational outputs (equal/greater/less), ensuring robustness against floating-point rounding errors in industrial control logic.

### Prompt:
**Real Comparator:**
Implement a self-contained function block in IEC 61131-3 structured text to compare two real inputs up to n decimal places. Include configurable precision and error handling.

**C-A-R-E:**

ğŸŸ¥ C (Context) â€“ Background Situation

In industrial automation, comparing floating-point numbers (REAL values) directly can lead to unpredictable results due to rounding errors and precision limits inherent to binary floating-point representation. This is especially problematic in control logic, threshold detection, or alarm handling where precise decimal-level comparisons are required. A configurable comparator that accounts for decimal precision helps ensure stable and reliable logic decisions.

ğŸŸ© A (Action) â€“ Task to Perform

Develop a self-contained function block in IEC 61131-3 Structured Text to compare two REAL inputs with a configurable number of decimal places. The function block should:
	â€¢	Take Input1, Input2 : REAL and Precision : INT as inputs
	â€¢	Round both inputs to the specified precision using a scaling method
	â€¢	Compare the results and set output flags:
	â€¢	Equal : BOOL
	â€¢	Greater : BOOL
	â€¢	Less : BOOL
	â€¢	Include input validation and an Error : BOOL output in case of invalid precision values
	â€¢	Be written for scan-cycle safety and modular reuse

â¸»

ğŸŸ¨ R (Result) â€“ Expected Outcome

The result is a modular, reusable comparator block that accurately determines equality or relational order between two REAL values up to n decimal places, ensuring:
	â€¢	Robust performance under rounding constraints
	â€¢	Clarity in control flow logic
	â€¢	Safe handling of erroneous or extreme inputs
	â€¢	Easy integration into PID tuning, setpoint checks, or quality monitoring systems

ğŸŸ¦ E (Example) â€“ Concrete Illustration

Example logic (simplified):

Scale := POWER(10, Precision);
Rounded1 := REAL_TO_INT(Input1 * Scale);
Rounded2 := REAL_TO_INT(Input2 * Scale);

Equal := (Rounded1 = Rounded2);
Greater := (Rounded1 > Rounded2);
Less := (Rounded1 < Rounded2);
Error := (Precision < 0);

Inputs:
	â€¢	Input1, Input2 : REAL
	â€¢	Precision : INT
	â€¢	Enable : BOOL

Outputs:
	â€¢	Equal, Greater, Less, Error : BOOL
