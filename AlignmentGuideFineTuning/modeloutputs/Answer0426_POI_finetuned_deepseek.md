### Intent:
**Intent Summary:**  
Develop a fuzzy logic controller in Python to optimize a chemical reactor's temperature, pressure, and reaction rate by dynamically adjusting heater power, pressure valves, and reactant flow, outperforming PID control in disturbance rejection and setpoint tracking.  

*(Focus: Fuzzy control for reactor optimization with performance comparison against PID, using nonlinear dynamics and disturbance handling.)*

### Prompt:
**Model Predictive Control for HVAC System Optimization Using C++:**

Develop C++ code to implement a model predictive control (MPC) algorithm for optimizing the performance of a Heating, Ventilation, and Air Conditioning (HVAC) system. The control system should manage temperature, humidity, and energy consumption while maintaining occupant comfort. It must consider dynamic constraints such as varying external temperatures, occupancy levels, and energy efficiency requirements, ensuring optimal control under changing environmental conditions.

Implement C++ code to simulate the HVAC systemâ€™s dynamics, and demonstrate how MPC can optimize energy usage, response time, and system performance while adhering to operational constraints.

**R-I-S-E:**

ðŸŸ© Iï¼ˆInputï¼‰

You are tasked with developing a model predictive control (MPC) system for an HVAC application. The system must manage indoor temperature, humidity, and energy consumption while considering constraints such as fluctuating external temperatures, varying occupancy levels, and energy efficiency goals. The goal is to maintain occupant comfort and optimize performance under dynamic environmental conditions.

ðŸŸ§ Sï¼ˆStepsï¼‰
	1.	Model the HVAC system dynamics in C++, including thermal response, humidity control, and energy usage behavior.
	2.	Implement an MPC algorithm that forecasts future system states and adjusts control signals in real time.
