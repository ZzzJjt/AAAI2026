### Intent:
**Intent Summary:**  
Create a comprehensive reference list of all mathematical function blocks in the OSCAT library, including descriptions and use cases, to assist PLC programmers in selecting and implementing advanced math operations for automation projects.  

*(Focus: Documentation of OSCAT's math functions for quick engineering reference.)*

### Prompt:
**List Mathematical Function Blocks:**
Compile a detailed list of all mathematical function blocks available in the OSCAT library for PLC programming, including a brief description of their functionality and typical use cases.

**B-A-B:**

ðŸŸ¥ Before â€“ The Starting Point

You are working with PLC programming in industrial automation and using the OSCAT (Open Source Community for Automation Technology) library. While the OSCAT library is known for its rich collection of function blocks, there is no centralized or detailed reference listing all the mathematical function blocks with descriptions and examples of how and when to use them.

â¸»

ðŸŸ© After â€“ The Desired Outcome

Create a comprehensive list of all mathematical function blocks available in the OSCAT library, each with:
	â€¢	A short description of what the function block does
	â€¢	The typical use cases or scenarios where itâ€™s applied
	â€¢	(Optional) Notes on parameter types, ranges, or limitations

This list will serve as a quick reference for control engineers and developers integrating advanced math operations in their automation projects.

â¸»

ðŸŸ¦ Bridge â€“ How to Get There

To create this list:
	1.	Extract all mathematical function blocks from the OSCAT documentation or source.
	2.	For each block:
	â€¢	Record the name
	â€¢	Write a one-line description (e.g., calculates sine, logarithm, RMS, etc.)
	â€¢	Note where it is typically used (e.g., PID loops, filtering, analytics, etc.)
	3.	Organize them into categories (e.g., trigonometry, statistics, algebraic functions)
	4.	Present in a readable format (e.g., table or markdown list)
