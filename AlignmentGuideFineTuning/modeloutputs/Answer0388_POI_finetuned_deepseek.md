### Intent:
**Intent Summary:**  
Create a textual Process Flow Diagram (PFD) for penicillin fermentation, detailing unit operations, material flows, instrumentation (e.g., TT, pH), and control logic (e.g., PID loops) in plain-text format for design documentation and automation input.  

*(Focus: Structured textual representation of process flow and control philosophy for penicillin production.)*

### Prompt:
**PFD Penicillin Fermentation:**

Create a Process Flow Diagram (PFD) in textual notation for a fermentation process to produce penicillin. Include instrumentation and control philosophy.

**C-A-R-E:**

🟥 C (Context) – Background Situation

In the design of a penicillin fermentation process, it’s essential to document the material flow, process units, and control mechanisms in a clear and structured way. Traditionally, this is done through graphical Process Flow Diagrams (PFDs). However, in environments without graphic capabilities—such as early-phase engineering, text-based collaboration, or version-controlled documentation—engineers rely on textual notation to convey process structure and control philosophy.

⸻

🟩 A (Action) – Task to Perform

Create a Process Flow Diagram (PFD) in textual notation for a penicillin fermentation process. The diagram should:
	•	List and connect major unit operations (e.g., media prep, sterilization, fermentation, separation)
	•	Show material flow using directional arrows (-->)
	•	Include key instrumentation (e.g., TT for temperature, pH for acidity, LT for level) with example tag numbers
	•	Describe the control philosophy for critical stages, such as how temperature, pH, or agitation is maintained and controlled using loops (e.g., TT101 → TIC101 → TC101)

⸻

🟨 R (Result) – Expected Outcome

The result will be a clearly formatted, plain-text PFD that captures the essential structure of the penicillin production process, including flow paths and control logic. It will be suitable for:
	•	Cross-functional communication
	•	Early-phase process design
	•	Input to automation system configuration
	•	Integration with control narratives and I/O lists

🟦 E (Example) – Concrete Illustration

Water Tank --> Nutrient Mixer --> Heat Sterilizer --> Fermenter --> Cell Separator --> Product Collection Tank

[Fermenter]
  - TT201 → TIC201 → Steam Valve (TC201): temperature control
  - pH202 → PIC202 → Base Pump (PC202): pH control
  - Agitator speed controlled manually or via local VFD
