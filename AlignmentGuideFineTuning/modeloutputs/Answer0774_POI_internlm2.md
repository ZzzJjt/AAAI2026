### Intent:
The task is to develop an ISA-88-compliant batch control program in IEC 61131-3 Structured Text for producing 100 kg of cocoa milk, including ingredient dosing, mixing at 200 RPM, heating to 70Â°C, and phase-based process control with fault handling.

### Prompt:
**Batch Cocoa Milk:**

Create an ISA-88 batch control recipe for producing 100 kg of cocoa milk, detailing the required ingredients, including milk, water, liquid sugar, and cocoa. The equipment should consist of a mixing and blending vessel capable of stirring and heating. Specify appropriate amounts for each ingredient, as well as optimal mixing temperatures and heating times.

Write a self-contained program in IEC 61131-3 Structured Text for the sequential control of the mixing process, incorporating typical parameter values such as stirring speed, temperature control, and time duration. Ensure the program follows ISA-88 principles, with clear logic for controlling the heating and blending phases. Discuss the challenges in scaling and optimizing the control process for industrial production.

**Challenges in Scaling and Optimization:**

Scaling the batch control process for industrial production can be challenging due to the need for precise control of ingredient quantities, mixing and heating times, and temperature. To optimize the process, it is essential to monitor and control the following parameters:

1. **Ingredient Dosage:** Accurate measurement and control of ingredient quantities are crucial for maintaining consistent product quality. This can be achieved through the use of precise weighing scales and automated dosing systems.

2. **Mixing and Heating Times:** The duration of the mixing and
