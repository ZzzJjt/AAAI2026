🟧 S (Steps) – Steps to Perform
	1.	Define the core control parameters:
	•	Temperature: 175 °C (range: 173–177 °C)
	•	Pressure: 4.8 bar (range: 4.6–5.0 bar)
	•	Flow ratio: Ammonia:Acid = 1.01:1
	•	pH: 6.2 (acceptable range: 5.8–6.5)
	2.	List required instrumentation:

	•	LSH-106 (high-level switch for overfill protection)
	3.	Describe operating procedures:
	•	Startup: Valve checks, initialize jacket heating, ramp up flows
	•	Normal Operation: Maintain setpoints with PID loops; monitor pH and adjust feed as needed
	•	Shutdown: Stop feeds, vent pressure, cool reactor, close all valves
	4.	Define interlocks and alarms:
	•	ESD if Temp > 185 °C, Pressure > 5.2 bar, or pH < 5.5
	•	Trigger alarms and lockout if ammonia or acid feed deviates ±10% from target ratio

Deliver a clear, structured, and technically sound control narrative that:
	•	Can be used by automation teams to configure DCS/PLC systems
	•	Supports safety, efficiency, and compliance in reactor operation
	•	Provides the basis for interlock diagrams, HMI logic, and alarm design
	•	Enhances operator understanding and engineering documentation

### Control Narrative for Ammonium Nitrate Reactor

#### Overview
The ammonium nitrate reactor is a continuous-flow reactor that produces ammonium nitrate by reacting ammonia and nitric acid in a controlled environment. The reactor operates at a fixed temperature and pressure, with precise control of flow ratios and pH. The process is monitored using a combination of temperature, pressure, flow, and pH instrumentation, with interlocks in place to ensure safe and efficient operation.
