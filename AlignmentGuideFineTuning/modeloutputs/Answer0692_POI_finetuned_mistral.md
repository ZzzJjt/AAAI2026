### Control Narrative for Ammonium Nitrate Reactor

#### Overview
The ammonium nitrate reactor is a continuous-flow reactor that produces ammonium nitrate by reacting ammonia and nitric acid in a controlled environment. The reactor operates at a fixed temperature and pressure, with precise control of flow ratios and pH. The process is monitored using a combination of temperature, pressure, flow, and pH instrumentation, with interlocks in place to ensure safe and efficient operation.

#### Setpoints and Operating Ranges
