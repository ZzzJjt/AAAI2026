### Intent:
The task is to develop a Structured Text program for ratio control that dynamically adjusts the flow rates of two reactants (A and B) to maintain a consistent 2:1 mixing ratio, while monitoring deviations and handling disturbances in real time.

### Prompt:
**Ratio Control Mixing:**

Develop a self-contained IEC 61131-3 Structured Text program (not a function block) to implement ratio control for mixing two reactants in a 2:1 ratio. The program should maintain the desired ratio between the two reactants by adjusting their flow rates dynamically, ensuring that for every two parts of reactant A, one part of reactant B is added.

Include logic to monitor the flow rates of both reactants and adjust one flow rate relative to the other to maintain the 2:1 ratio. The program should also handle any disturbances or variations in flow, adjusting the control signals to correct for deviations from the target ratio. Discuss the importance of ratio control in maintaining the desired chemical composition and the impact of disturbances on the mixing process.

ðŸŸ¥ T (Task) â€“ What You Need to Do

Write a self-contained IEC 61131-3 Structured Text program (not a function block) to implement ratio control for mixing two reactants in a 2:1 flow ratio (Reactant A to Reactant B).

â¸»

ðŸŸ© A (Action) â€“ How to Do It
	1.	Measure the flow rates of Reactant A (Flow_A_PV) and Reactant B (Flow_B_PV).
	2.	Calculate the actual mixing ratio as Flow_A_PV / Flow_B_PV.
	3.	Compute the setpoint for Reactant Bâ€™s flow to maintain the 2:1 ratio:
Flow_B_SP := Flow_A_PV / 2.0
	4.	Include a tolerance check to ensure that the actual ratio stays close to the desired value (Ratio_Setpoint := 2.0).
	5.	Compare the actual ratio with the desired ratio and raise an alarm or flag if the deviation exceeds a defined threshold.

ðŸŸ¦ G (Goal) â€“ What You Want to Achieve
	â€¢	Ensure that the flow of Reactant B is adjusted dynamically to maintain a 2:1 ratio with Reactant A.

ðŸŸ¥ D (Discussion) â€“ Why It Matters

Ratio control is crucial in chemical processes where precise mixing ratios are required to achieve specific chemical reactions or product compositions. In this case, maintaining a 2:1 ratio of Reactant A to Reactant B ensures the desired chemical reaction occurs without over- or under-mixing. Disturbances in flow rates can cause deviations from the target ratio, leading to inconsistent product quality or process instability. By implementing dynamic ratio control, the mixing process remains robust and responsive to changing flow conditions, ensuring consistent chemical composition and process performance.

ðŸŸ© R (Role) â€“ Who Is Responsible

The role of the Structured Text program is to act as a self-contained control logic for maintaining a 2:1 ratio between Reactant A and Reactant B in a continuous mixing process. It monitors the flow rates of both reactants, calculates the actual mixing ratio, and adjusts the flow of Reactant B to maintain the desired ratio. The program handles disturbances in flow conditions by dynamically recalculating the flow setpoint for Reactant B, ensuring consistent chemical composition and process stability.
