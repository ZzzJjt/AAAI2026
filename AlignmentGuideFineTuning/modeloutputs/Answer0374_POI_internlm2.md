### Intent:
**Intent Summary:**  
Create a reusable IEC 61131-3 Structured Text function block to convert Fahrenheit to Celsius with input validation (checking against absolute zero) and status flagging for industrial PLC applications.

### Prompt:
**Fahrenheit to Celsius:**
Implement a self-contained function block in IEC 61131-3 structured text to convert Fahrenheit to Celsius. Ensure it handles input validation and provides accurate results.

**C-A-R-E:**

ðŸŸ¥ C (Context) â€“ Background Situation

Temperature conversion between Fahrenheit and Celsius is frequently needed in industrial control systemsâ€”especially in HVAC, process heating, and international deployments. Relying on manual calculations or repeated code snippets can lead to inconsistencies, rounding errors, and logic duplication. A dedicated, reusable Structured Text function block ensures accuracy, validation, and consistent integration into PLC programs.

ðŸŸ© A (Action) â€“ Task to Perform

Create a self-contained function block in IEC 61131-3 Structured Text that:
	â€¢	Accepts a temperature input in Fahrenheit
	â€¢	Converts the value to Celsius using the formula:
 C = (F - 32) \times \frac{5}{9}
	â€¢	Performs input validation, such as checking that the input is not below absolute zero (âˆ’459.67Â°F)
	â€¢	Outputs the result in Celsius, along with a ValidInput boolean status flag
	â€¢	Includes clear comments, modular structure, and scan-cycle-safe logic

â¸»

ðŸŸ¨ R (Result) â€“ Expected Outcome

The outcome should be a modular and reliable function block that can be reused in any program requiring Fahrenheit-to-Celsius conversion. It will offer:
	â€¢	Accurate results using real data types
	â€¢	Built-in validation to protect against invalid sensor readings
	â€¢	Clean, maintainable code suitable for both educational and production PLC applications

â¸»

ðŸŸ¦ E (Example) â€“ Concrete Illustration

Example logic inside the function block:
IF Fahrenheit >= -459.67 THEN
   Celsius := (Fahrenheit - 32.0) * 5.0 / 9.0;
   ValidInput := TRUE;
ELSE
   Celsius := 0.0;
   ValidInput := FALSE;
END_IF;
Inputs:
	â€¢	Fahrenheit : REAL

Outputs:
	â€¢	Celsius : REAL
	â€¢	ValidInput : BOOL

   Fahrenheit : REAL;
END_VAR
VAR_OUTPUT
   Celsius : REAL;
   ValidInput : BOOL;
END_VAR
BEGIN
   IF Fahrenheit >= -459.67 THEN

ðŸŸ© T (Test) â€“ Verification of Correctness

Test the function block with various Fahrenheit inputs, including those below absolute zero, and verify that the output is correct and the ValidInput flag is set appropriately.

ðŸŸ© E (Evaluation) â€“ Assessment of Success

The function block should pass all tests and provide accurate results for Fahrenheit-to-Celsius conversion. It should also handle invalid inputs gracefully and provide a clear indication of the validity of the input.

ðŸŸ© R (Refinement) â€“ Iterative Improvement

Consider adding additional features to the function block, such as:
	â€¢	Input range checking (e.g., Fahrenheit should be within a reasonable range)
	â€¢	Option to round the output to a specific number of decimal places
	â€¢	Option to handle Fahrenheit values outside the typical range (e.g., for thermocouples)
	â€¢	Option to handle negative Celsius values (e.g., for thermocouples)
	â€¢	Option to handle Fahrenheit values with fractional parts (e.g., 32.5Â°F)
	â€¢	Option to handle Fahrenheit values with scientific notation (e.g., 1.23E+2Â°F)

ðŸŸ© A (Assessment) â€“ Final Evaluation

The function block should be thoroughly tested and refined to ensure it meets the requirements and provides a reliable, reusable solution for Fahrenheit-to-Celsius conversion in industrial PLC applications. It should be well-documented, easy to understand, and maintainable for future enhancements.
