### Intent:
**Intent Summary:**  
Create an IEC 61131-3 Structured Text program to control a coffee machine with three tanks (coffee, milk, mixer) and valves, handling drink selection (coffee-only or coffee-milk), automated filling/mixing/dispensing cycles, and emergency stop functionality for safety.  

*(Key focus: State-based control, tank/valve logic, real-time safety, and drink mode flexibility.)*

### Prompt:
**Coffee Maker Control Using 61131-3 Structured Text:**

Write a self-contained 61131-3 structured text (ST) program to control a coffee machine that manages three tanks (coffee, milk, and mixer) and three valves (one for coffee, one for milk, and one for output). The machine should mix coffee and milk properly to create the best output, following this process:

System Description:

	1.	Tanks and Valves:
	â€¢	The coffee and milk valves open to fill the mixer tank. The mixer tank can hold up to 130ml, and when it reaches the maximum level, the coffee and milk valves will close.
	2.	Mixing Process:
	â€¢	Once the tank is full, the mixer starts automatically and runs for 4 seconds. After mixing is complete, the output valve opens to dispense the coffee.
	3.	Control Buttons:
	â€¢	Button 1: Emergency Stop â€” Stops the entire system instantly in case of malfunction, such as valve failures, tank level issues, or mixer failures.
	â€¢	Button 2: Start â€” Begins the coffee-making process.
	â€¢	Button 3: Coffee and Milk â€” Prepares coffee with milk by opening both the coffee and milk valves.
	â€¢	Button 4: Coffee Only â€” Prepares coffee without milk by only opening the coffee valve.

Safety Features:

	â€¢	Implement the emergency stop to handle unexpected events, such as valve malfunctions, tank level detection failures, or mixer operation failures. When triggered, the system should stop immediately to ensure safety.

**R-I-S-E:**

ðŸŸ¥ R (Role) â€“ Your Role

	2.	Tank filling logic:
	â€¢	Keep valves open until MixerLevelFull is TRUE
	â€¢	Once full, close all input valves and start the Mixer motor
	3.	Mixing and dispensing:
	â€¢	Run the mixer for 4 seconds (use TON timer)
	â€¢	Once mixing is complete, stop the mixer and open the OutputValve to dispense the coffee
	4.	Handle safety and emergency conditions:
	â€¢	At any time, if EmergencyStop = TRUE, immediately stop all components:
	â€¢	Set CoffeeValve, MilkValve, OutputValve, Mixer = FALSE
	â€¢	Reset state machine to IDLE
	â€¢	Optionally trigger alarms or status indicators

â¸»

ðŸŸ¦ E (Expectation) â€“ What Success Looks Like

You produce a structured, reliable, and real-time capable control program that:
	â€¢	Handles two drink modes (coffee-only and coffee with milk)
	â€¢	Executes the fill â†’ mix â†’ dispense cycle based on tank levels and timers
	â€¢	Supports a fully responsive Emergency Stop that halts and resets the machine safely
	â€¢	Can be integrated with an HMI or expanded with diagnostics for valve/mixer faults
	â€¢	Follows IEC 61131-3 best practices, with clear state management, fail-safe logic, and modular readability

ðŸŸª I (Instructions) â€“ How to Achieve Success

1.	Create a state machine to manage the coffee machine's operations:
	â€¢	IDLE
	â€¢	START
	â€¢	MIX
	â€¢	DISPENSE
	â€¢	STOP
2.	Define the state transitions:
	â€¢	Start -> IDLE: Press Start and select a mode
	â€¢	Start -> MIX: Fill the mixer and start the mixer
	â€¢	MIX -> DISPENSE: Run the mixer for 4 seconds and open the OutputValve
	â€¢	DISPENSE -> STOP: Dispense the coffee and move to STOP
	â€¢	STOP -> IDLE: Reset all components and move to IDLE
3.	Implement the input monitoring and mode selection:
	â€¢	Check if Start is pressed and a mode is selected
	â€¢	If so, transition to the MIX state
4.	Define the tank filling logic:
	â€¢	Open the relevant valves and monitor the MixerLevelFull
	â€¢	Once full, close the valves and transition to the MIX state
5.	Implement the mixing and dispensing:
	â€¢	Use a TON timer for the mixer
	â€¢	Once the mixing is complete, transition to the DISPENSE state
6.	Handle safety and emergency conditions:
	â€¢	Add a state for EmergencyStop
	â€¢	Transition to the STOP state when EmergencyStop is TRUE
	â€¢	Reset all components and move to IDLE
7.	Test and refine the program, ensuring it meets the expectations outlined in the "Success Looks Like" section.

By following these steps, you will create a robust and reliable coffee machine control program using IEC 61131-3 Structured Text.
