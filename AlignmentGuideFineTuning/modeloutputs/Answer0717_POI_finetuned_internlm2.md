### Intent:
**Intent Summary:**  
Develop an IEC 61131-3 Structured Text function block that encapsulates a C-based OPC UA client, providing PLC programmers with a standardized interface (Execute/ServerUrl/Timeout inputs, Done/Busy/Error outputs) to manage server connections, handle errors, and integrate seamlessly into industrial automation systems.  

*(Focus: C-to-ST integration, OPC UA client lifecycle, and PLC-friendly error handling.)*

### Prompt:
**OPC UA Client Implementation Using C and IEC 61131-3 Structured Text:**

Develop C-code for an OPC UA client, then wrap it into an IEC 61131-based function block written in structured text (ST). The function block should have the following input pins: Execute (type: BOOL), ServerUrl (type: STRING[255]), and Timeout (type: TIME). The output pins should include Done (type: BOOL), Busy (type: BOOL), Error (type: BOOL), and ErrorID (type: DWORD). In your explanation, describe how the C-code interfaces with the OPC UA server, how the function block manages communication with the server, and how error handling is implemented. Provide details on how to integrate this function block within an IEC 61131-3 environment for reliable client-server communication.

**R-T-F:**

ðŸŸ¥ R (Role) â€“ Your Role

Act as a control systems programmer integrating C-based communication libraries into an IEC 61131-3 Structured Text (ST) environment for industrial automation.

ðŸŸ© T (Task) â€“ What You Need to Do

Develop a C-based OPC UA client using a library such as open62541, and encapsulate its functionality within an IEC 61131-3 Structured Text function block. The function block must manage connection lifecycle and expose a clear interface to PLC programmers:

Inputs:
	â€¢	Execute (BOOL): Starts the connection attempt
	â€¢	ServerUrl (STRING[255]): Specifies the target OPC UA server
	â€¢	Timeout (TIME): Defines the maximum time to wait for a response

Outputs:
	â€¢	Done (BOOL): Indicates successful completion
	â€¢	Busy (BOOL): Signals an ongoing connection attempt
	â€¢	Error (BOOL): Signals failure
	â€¢	ErrorID (DWORD): Provides diagnostic information

Additionally, you must describe how the C code interfaces with the OPC UA server and how the ST function block tracks execution status, handles timeouts, and reports errors.

ðŸŸ§ F (Format) â€“ Expected Output

Deliver:
	â€¢	A modular and reusable ST function block implementing the above interface
	â€¢	A C function or library that establishes and manages OPC UA client connections
	â€¢	Internal logic within the ST block for rising-edge detection on Execute, non-blocking status transitions (Busy, Done), and structured error reporting via ErrorID
	â€¢	Integration documentation explaining how to link the C code to the ST block and embed it in a typical PLC cycle

ðŸŸ¥ C (Context) â€“ Background

OPC UA (Open Platform Communications Unified Architecture) is a secure, open, and platform-independent communication protocol for industrial automation. It enables seamless integration of devices, systems, and applications across different vendors and platforms. C-based libraries, such as open62541, provide a robust foundation for implementing OPC UA clients in industrial control systems. However, integrating C code into IEC 61131-3 Structured Text (ST) can be challenging due to the differences in syntax and execution model. This task aims to create a self-contained function block that encapsulates the C-based OPC UA client, providing a clear interface for PLC programmers to manage server connections, handle errors, and integrate seamlessly into industrial automation systems.

ðŸŸ© A (Action) â€“ What You Should Do

Develop a C-based OPC UA client using a library like open62541, and encapsulate its functionality within an IEC 61131-3 Structured Text function block. The function block should have the following input pins: Execute (type: BOOL), ServerUrl (type: STRING[255]), and Timeout (type: TIME). The output pins should include Done (type: BOOL), Busy (type: BOOL), Error (type: BOOL), and ErrorID (type: DWORD). In your explanation, describe how the C-code interfaces with the OPC UA server, how the function block manages communication with the server, and how error handling is implemented. Provide details on how to integrate this function block within an IEC 61131-3 environment for reliable client-server communication.

ðŸŸ¨ R (Result) â€“ What You Should Achieve

Deliver a self-contained IEC 61131-3 Structured Text function block that encapsulates a C-based OPC UA client. The function block should have clear input and output interfaces, manage connection lifecycle, and handle errors in a PLC-friendly manner. Provide a detailed explanation of the C-code implementation, including how it interfaces with the OPC UA server, and describe how the ST function block manages communication and error handling. Include documentation on integrating the C code with the ST block and embedding it in a typical PLC cycle.
