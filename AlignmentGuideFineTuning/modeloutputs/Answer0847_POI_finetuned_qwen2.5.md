### Intent:
**Intent Summary:**  
Develop a fail-safe IEC 61131-3 Structured Text program to monitor and control a pressure relief valve, ensuring it opens during overpressure conditions, remains open until safe pressure is restored, and defaults to a safe state during sensor/valve failures to protect industrial equipment.  

*(Focus: Autonomous overpressure protection with fault tolerance and compliance to safety standards.)*

### Prompt:
**Interlock Pressure Relief:**

Develop a self-contained IEC 61131-3 Structured Text program to implement an interlock system for opening a pressure relief valve in a vessel upon detecting overpressure. The program should monitor the vessel pressure using a pressure sensor and trigger the opening of the relief valve when the pressure exceeds a predefined safe limit.

The logic should ensure that the pressure relief valve remains open until the vessel pressure drops below a safe threshold. Additionally, incorporate safety checks to account for sensor failures or valve malfunctions, ensuring that the system defaults to a safe state in the event of a fault. Discuss the significance of pressure relief systems in protecting industrial processes from overpressure hazards and ensuring operational safety.

ðŸŸ¥ T (Task) â€“ What You Need to Do

Develop a Structured Text program using IEC 61131-3 to implement an interlock system for pressure relief in a pressurized vessel.

â¸»

ðŸŸ© A (Action) â€“ How to Do It
	1.	Monitor vessel pressure using a pressure transmitter (e.g., PT_101).
	2.	Trigger the pressure relief valve (e.g., RELIEF_VALVE := TRUE) when the pressure exceeds a defined high limit (e.g., 15 bar).
	3.	Keep the valve open until the pressure drops below a defined reset threshold (e.g., 12 bar), preventing premature reclosing.
	4.	Add fail-safe logic to:
	â€¢	Open the relief valve if a sensor fault or valve malfunction is detected.
	â€¢	Ensure the system defaults to a safe state (valve open) in the event of uncertainty.
	5.	Use latching to maintain the valveâ€™s open state until safe conditions are verified and reset logic allows closure.

ðŸŸ¦ G (Goal) â€“ What You Want to Achieve

Create a robust, fail-safe overpressure protection system that automatically mitigates risk during pressure excursions, ensures safe operation under fault conditions, and prevents vessel damage or process failure. The program must operate autonomously and align with industrial safety standards.

ðŸŸ¥ R (Role) â€“ Your Role

You are a PLC programmer or automation engineer responsible for implementing safety interlocks in a pressure vessel system using IEC 61131-3 Structured Text.

ðŸŸ© I (Input) â€“ What Youâ€™re Given

	â€¢	A pressure sensor (PT_101) that feeds a pressure value to the PLC.
	â€¢	A pressure relief valve (RELIEF_VALVE) that can be opened or closed.
	â€¢	A high pressure limit (e.g., 15 bar) that triggers the opening of the relief valve.
	â€¢	A safe pressure threshold (e.g., 12 bar) that allows the valve to close.
	â€¢	An emergency stop button (EMG_STOP) that should trigger the opening of the relief valve if pressed.

ðŸŸ§ S (Steps) â€“ How to Do It

	1.	Define the pressure limits and thresholds:
	â€¢	Pressure high limit: 15 bar
	â€¢	Pressure safe limit: 12 bar
	2.	Implement the logic to monitor the pressure and trigger the relief valve:
	â€¢	Use a CASE statement to check the pressure level.
	â€¢	Open the relief valve if the pressure exceeds the high limit.
	3.	Implement logic to maintain the relief valve open until the pressure drops below the safe limit:
	â€¢	Use a timer or a WHILE loop to monitor the pressure.
	â€¢	Keep the relief valve open until the pressure is below the safe limit.
	4.	Implement safety checks for sensor and valve faults:
	â€¢	Use a CASE statement to monitor the status of the pressure sensor and the relief valve.
	â€¢	Open the relief valve if the sensor or valve is not functioning properly.
	5.	Implement emergency stop functionality:
	â€¢	Use a CASE statement to monitor the emergency stop button.
	â€¢	Open the relief valve if the emergency stop button is pressed.
