	‚Ä¢	Output: either amplitude array or real/imaginary arrays
	2.	Implement FFT logic using:
	‚Ä¢	Bit-reversal reordering
	‚Ä¢	Butterfly computation with twiddle factors
	‚Ä¢	Looping constructs that avoid recursion or dynamic memory usage
	3.	Optimize for PLC performance by:
	‚Ä¢	Using only power-of-two input sizes
	‚Ä¢	Precomputing or approximating sine/cosine values if needed
	‚Ä¢	Limiting execution time to fit within typical scan cycles
	4.	Comment thoroughly, explaining:
	‚Ä¢	Purpose of each calculation step
	‚Ä¢	How twiddle factors are computed and applied
	‚Ä¢	How to interpret the resulting frequency bins
	5.	Document known limitations, such as:
	‚Ä¢	Fixed input length
	‚Ä¢	Absence of floating-point complex number support on some PLCs
