### Intent:
The task involves refactoring an IEC 61131-3 batch control program for polyethylene production by removing loops, abstracting repeated logic into methods, and implementing a state machine with proper timing and transitions to improve maintainability and scalability.  

**Intent:** Optimize a procedural batch control program into an object-oriented state machine with reusable methods and safe state transitions.

### Prompt:
**Object-oriented 61131-3:**
Discuss the concept of classes and methods introduced in IEC 61131-3 Version 3.0, including a detailed explanation of their limitations, advantages, and disadvantages in the context of industrial automation. Provide a relevant example to illustrate these concepts in practice.

Explain how inheritance is implemented in IEC 61131-3, building on the previous example to show how derived classes can extend base functionality. Additionally, refine the example further to demonstrate polymorphism within this framework, discussing its practical applications and constraints.

**C-A-R-E:**

ðŸŸ¥ C (Context) â€“ Background

In earlier versions of IEC 61131-3, industrial control programming was largely procedural, limiting scalability, reuse, and abstraction. However, Version 3.0 introduced object-oriented features such as classes, methods, inheritance, and polymorphismâ€”bridging industrial automation with software engineering practices.

ðŸŸ© A (Action) â€“ What You Need to Do

Create a detailed explanation covering the object-oriented extensions in IEC 61131-3 Version 3.0, specifically:
	1.	Explain how classes and methods are structured in this standard.
	2.	Discuss the advantages and disadvantages of using these features in an industrial context (e.g., code reuse vs. debugging complexity).
	3.	Show how inheritance is implementedâ€”how derived function blocks can extend base logic.
	4.	Demonstrate polymorphism, including method overriding and interface use.
	5.	Address limitations and practical constraints (e.g., real-time performance, vendor implementation gaps).

â¸»

ðŸŸ¨ R (Result) â€“ What the Outcome Provides

This will give developers and automation engineers:
	â€¢	A clear understanding of how to use OOP principles in IEC 61131-3
	â€¢	Insight into real-world trade-offs (e.g., flexibility vs. execution time)
	â€¢	A way to design more modular, scalable, and maintainable control systems
	â€¢	The ability to extend and abstract common logic across projects using standardized OOP structures

// Base class: Actuator

  // Basic start logic
END_METHOD

// Derived class: Valve
FUNCTION_BLOCK FB_Valve EXTENDS FB_Actuator
METHOD Start : BOOL
  // Override base logic with valve-specific behavior
