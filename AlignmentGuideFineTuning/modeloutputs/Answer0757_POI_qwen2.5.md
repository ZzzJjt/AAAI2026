### Intent:
The task is to develop a **cascade control system** in Structured Text that regulates oil refinery vessel pressure by using an outer PID loop to adjust the flow setpoint and an inner loop to control the flow valve, with safety constraints and input validation.

### Prompt:
**PID Pressure Control Chemical Reactor:**

Develop a self-contained IEC 61131-3 Structured Text program to implement PID feedback control for regulating the pressure in a chemical reactor. The program should continuously adjust the opening of a pressure control valve based on a setpoint to maintain optimal pressure levels within the reactor.

Include the PID control loop parameters (proportional, integral, and derivative gains) and ensure the logic accounts for pressure deviations from the setpoint. The program should also include safeguards to prevent over-pressurization or under-pressurization by limiting the valveâ€™s operational range. Discuss the critical role of pressure control in chemical reactors, emphasizing safety, process efficiency, and system stability under dynamic reaction conditions.

END_IF

// Output the valve position
Output_Valve(Valve_Output);

**Safety Constraints and Input Validation:**

To ensure the safety and reliability of the PID control system, implement the following safety constraints and input validation:

1. **Valve Output Clamping:** Limit the valve output to a safe range between 0% and 100% to prevent over-pressurization or under-pressurization.
2. **Input Validation:** Validate the input pressure values to ensure they are within a safe range and handle any invalid inputs gracefully.
3. **PID Gain Validation:** Validate the PID gain values to ensure they are within a safe range and handle any invalid gain values gracefully.
4. **Error Handling:** Implement error handling mechanisms to detect and respond to any unexpected events or errors that may occur during the operation of the PID control system.

**PID Control Algorithm:**

The PID control algorithm is a widely used control strategy that combines proportional, integral, and derivative terms to adjust the control output based on the error between the setpoint and the process variable. The algorithm can be represented by the following equation:

```
Output = Kp * Error + Ki * Integral + Kd * Derivative
```

Where:
- Output is the control output (e.g., valve position)
- Kp is the proportional gain
- Ki is the integral gain
- Kd is the derivative gain
- Error is the difference between the setpoint and the process variable
- Integral is the accumulated error over time
- Derivative is the rate of change of the error

**PID Control Loop:**

The PID control loop is the core of the PID control system. It continuously monitors the process variable, calculates the control output based on the PID algorithm, and adjusts the control output to minimize the error between the setpoint and the process variable. The PID control loop can be represented by the following pseudocode:

```
while True:
    # Read the process variable
    process_variable = read_process_variable()

    # Calculate the error
    error = setpoint - process_variable

    # Calculate the integral
    integral = integral + error * dt

    # Calculate the derivative
    derivative = (error - previous_error) / dt

    # Calculate the control output
    control_output = Kp * error + Ki * integral + Kd * derivative

    # Apply the control output to the process
    apply_control_output(control_output)

    # Update the previous error
    previous_error
