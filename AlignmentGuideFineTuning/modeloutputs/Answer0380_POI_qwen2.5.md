### Intent:
**Intent Summary:**  
Create a reusable IEC 61131-3 Structured Text function block for a configurable timer with start/stop controls, elapsed/remaining time tracking, and timeout handling for industrial automation applications.

### Prompt:
**Timer:**
Implement a self-contained function block in IEC 61131-3 structured text to create a timer. Include configurable time duration, start/stop controls, and timeout handling.


**C-A-R-E:**

ðŸŸ¥ C (Context) â€“ Background Situation

Timers are fundamental building blocks in PLC programming, used for delays, sequencing, and interlock conditions. However, many standard timers are rigid or lack modular control logic, making it difficult to customize behavior such as dynamically changing durations or adding start/stop logic. For reusable automation code, a flexible and configurable Structured Text timer block is preferred.

ðŸŸ© A (Action) â€“ Task to Perform

Design a self-contained timer function block in IEC 61131-3 Structured Text that includes:
	â€¢	Configurable time duration via PresetTime : TIME
	â€¢	Start and Stop inputs to control execution dynamically
	â€¢	Elapsed time tracking with a built-in timeout mechanism
	â€¢	Internal logic to handle rising-edge detection and accurate scan-cycle timing
	â€¢	Output flags including:
	â€¢	Running : BOOL â€“ TRUE when counting
	â€¢	Done : BOOL â€“ TRUE when the timer completes
	â€¢	Optionally, RemainingTime : TIME

â¸»

ðŸŸ¨ R (Result) â€“ Expected Outcome

The outcome will be a modular, reusable timer block that:
	â€¢	Integrates cleanly into any PLC program requiring timing functionality
	â€¢	Enables dynamic control with start/stop inputs
	â€¢	Offers scan-cycle accuracy and proper handling of timer overflow
	â€¢	Can be used across a wide range of automation tasks (e.g., heating cycles, alarms, delays)

ðŸŸ¦ E (Example) â€“ Concrete Illustration

Simplified logic:

IF Start AND NOT Stop THEN
    IF NOT Running THEN
        StartTime := TIME(); // Capture current time
        Running := TRUE;
    END_IF;

    ElapsedTime := TIME() - StartTime;

    IF ElapsedTime >= PresetTime THEN
        Done := TRUE;
        Running := FALSE;
    END_IF;
ELSIF Stop THEN
    Running := FALSE;
    Done := FALSE;
    ElapsedTime := T#0s;
END_IF;

Simplified logic:

IF Start AND NOT Stop THEN
    IF NOT Running THEN
        StartTime := TIME(); // Capture current time
        Running := TRUE;
    END_IF;

    ElapsedTime := TIME() - StartTime;

    IF ElapsedTime >= PresetTime THEN
        Done := TRUE;
        Running := FALSE;
    END_IF;
ELSIF Stop THEN
    Running := FALSE;
    Done := FALSE;
    ElapsedTime := T#0s;
END_IF; To create a reusable IEC 61131-3 Structured Text function block for a configurable timer with start/stop controls, elapsed/remaining time tracking, and timeout handling, follow these steps:

1. **Define Inputs and Outputs:**
   - PresetTime: TIME (Configurable time duration)
   - Start: BOOL (Start the timer)
   - Stop: BOOL (Stop the timer)
   - Running: BOOL (Output indicating if the timer is running)
   - Done: BOOL (Output indicating if the timer has completed)
   - RemainingTime: TIME (Optional output showing the remaining time)

2. **Initialize Variables:**
   - StartTime: TIME (To store the start time)
   - ElapsedTime: TIME (To calculate the elapsed time)
   - Running: BOOL (To track if the timer is running)
   - Done: BOOL (To track if the timer has completed)

3. **Implement Logic:**
   - Capture the start time when the timer starts.
   - Calculate the elapsed time.
   - Check if the elapsed time exceeds the preset time and set the done flag accordingly.
   - Handle the stop input to reset the timer.

Here's the structured text code for the timer function block:

```structuredtext
FUNCTION_BLOCK Timer
VAR_INPUT
    PresetTime : TIME;
    Start : BOOL;
    Stop : BOOL;
END_VAR

VAR_OUTPUT
    Running : BOOL;
    Done : BOOL;
    RemainingTime : TIME;
END_VAR

VAR
    StartTime : TIME;
    ElapsedTime : TIME;
    Running : BOOL;
    Done : BOOL;
END_VAR

IF Start AND NOT Stop THEN
    IF NOT Running THEN
        StartTime := TIME(); // Capture current time
        Running := TRUE;
    END_IF;

    ElapsedTime := TIME() - StartTime;

    IF ElapsedTime >= PresetTime THEN
        Done := TRUE;
        Running := FALSE;
    END_IF;
ELSIF Stop THEN
    Running := FALSE;
    Done := FALSE;
    ElapsedTime := T#0s;
END_IF;

RemainingTime := PresetTime - ElapsedTime;
```

### Explanation:
- **Inputs:**
  - `PresetTime`: Configurable time duration.
  - `Start`: Start the timer.
  - `Stop`: Stop the timer.

- **Outputs:**
  - `Running`: Indicates if the timer is running.
  - `Done`: Indicates if the timer has completed.
  - `
