### Intent:
**Intent Summary:**  
Develop an IEC 61131-3 Structured Text program to monitor subsea gas wellhead pressure, temperature, and flow rate, triggering emergency shutdowns (e.g., closing the master valve) if limits are exceeded, with latching logic and manual reset requirements to ensure safe operation.  

**Key Focus:**  
- **Safety Interlocks:** Halt operations on pressure (>1500 psi), temperature (>120Â°C), or flow anomalies (leak detection).  
- **Fail-Safe Design:** Latching shutdowns prevent auto-restart; manual reset enforces operator verification.  
- **Critical Protection:** Mitigates risks like blowouts, overheating, or leaks in subsea environments.  

*(Concisely captures the taskâ€™s purpose, logic requirements, and safety rationale.)*

### Prompt:
**Interlock Gas Wellhead:**

Develop a self-contained IEC 61131-3 Structured Text program to implement emergency interlocks for a subsea gas wellhead. The program should monitor critical parameters such as wellhead pressure, temperature, and flow rates using pressure transmitters (PT), temperature transmitters (TT), and flow meters (FT). The interlock system should immediately trigger emergency shutdown procedures if any of these parameters exceed predefined safety limits.

The program should include logic for closing the master valve (MV-101) if wellhead pressure exceeds 1500 psi, or if flow rate drops below the minimum threshold, indicating a potential leak. Additionally, integrate temperature monitoring to shut down the system if the temperature exceeds 120Â°C. Incorporate safety features such as automatic reset prevention, ensuring that manual intervention is required to restart the system after an emergency shutdown.

Discuss the critical role of emergency interlocks in subsea gas wellhead operations, particularly in preventing catastrophic failures due to pressure, temperature, or flow anomalies.

	â€¢	Initiate system shutdown if temperature exceeds 120Â°C
	â€¢	Include logic to latch the shutdown condition and prevent automatic restart
	â€¢	Require manual reset to clear the shutdown flag and restore normal operation
