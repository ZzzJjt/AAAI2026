### Intent:
The task is to create a fixed traffic light control system in IEC 61131-3 Structured Text that implements a state machine with timed transitions, pedestrian crossing support, emergency vehicle priority, and safe light sequencing while adhering to PLC programming standards.

### Prompt:
**Programming Reference:**
Compile a comprehensive list of all valid keywords used in the IEC 61131-3 Structured Text programming language, ensuring that it covers both standard control flow structures and data types. Include examples of usage for key functions where applicable.

**B-A-B:**

ðŸŸ¥ Before â€“ The Current Situation

You are working with IEC 61131-3 Structured Text, a standard language used in industrial automation for programmable logic controllers (PLCs). Developers often struggle to find a single, consolidated reference that lists all valid keywords, especially for control flow, data types, and functions, along with practical usage examples.

â¸»

ðŸŸ© After â€“ The Desired Outcome

You will have a comprehensive, well-organized programming reference that includes:
	â€¢	All reserved keywords and standard identifiers in IEC 61131-3 Structured Text
	â€¢	Control structures such as IF, CASE, FOR, WHILE, etc.
	â€¢	Data types including BOOL, INT, REAL, ARRAY, STRUCT, and more
	â€¢	Standard functions and function blocks, like TON, CTU, ABS, SQRT, with example usages
	â€¢	Brief code snippets to demonstrate how the most important constructs are used in practice

â¸»

ðŸŸ¦ Bridge â€“ What You Need to Do

Compile and present a structured reference document that includes:
	1.	A keyword category breakdown:
	â€¢	Control flow (IF, ELSIF, END_IF, CASE, FOR, REPEAT, etc.)
	â€¢	Data types (BOOL, INT, REAL, TIME, STRING, etc.)
	â€¢	Operators (AND, OR, MOD, NOT, etc.)
	â€¢	System constants (TRUE, FALSE, MAX, MIN, etc.)
	2.	A section on standard functions and function blocks with:
	â€¢	Brief descriptions
	â€¢	IEC 61131-3-compliant usage examples
	â€¢	Notes on any vendor-specific behavior, if applicable
	3.	A downloadable or easily searchable format, such as:
	â€¢	A table or checklist format for fast lookup
	â€¢	Highlighted example blocks like:

 VAR
  x: INT := 5;
  y: INT := 10;
  result: BOOL;
END_VAR

IF x < y THEN
  result := TRUE;
END_IF;

### Generated Code:
The task is to create a fixed traffic light control system in IEC 61131-3 Structured Text that implements a state machine with timed transitions, pedestrian crossing support, emergency vehicle priority, and safe light sequencing while adhering to PLC programming standards.

ðŸŸª Obstacle â€“ What to Avoid

Avoid creating a reference that is too long, hard to navigate, or lacks practical examples. Ensure that the reference is concise, well-structured, and easy to understand.

â¸»

ðŸŸ« Solution â€“ How to Overcome

To overcome this, you can:
	1.	Divide the reference into logical sections, such as control structures, data types, functions, and system constants.
	2.	Use clear, concise headings and subheadings to guide the reader through the content.
	3.	Include practical examples and code snippets to demonstrate the usage of each keyword or function.
	4.	Use a table or checklist format for easy navigation and quick lookup.
	5.	Ensure that the reference is well-formatted, with proper indentation and consistent syntax.

ðŸŸ¦ Result â€“ The Desired Outcome

By following these guidelines, you will create a comprehensive, well-structured, and easy-to-use programming reference that will help developers quickly and efficiently write high-quality code in IEC 61131-3 Structured Text.
