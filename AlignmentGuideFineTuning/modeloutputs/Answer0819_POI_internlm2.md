The MPC system should be able to handle a range of wind speeds and turbine configurations, demonstrating its flexibility and robustness.

**Implementation Steps:**

1. **Define the Wind Farm Model:**
   - Create a C++ class to represent the wind farm, including the number of turbines, their locations, and their individual characteristics (e.g., capacity, efficiency, response time).
   - Implement a function to simulate wind speed fluctuations over time, considering factors such as seasonality, local weather patterns, and turbulence.

2. **Model Turbine Dynamics:**
   - Develop a model to describe the dynamics of each turbine, including its response to changes in wind speed and its ability to generate power.
   - Incorporate constraints on turbine operation, such as maximum and minimum power output, and limitations on rotor speed.

3. **Implement Energy Storage:**
   - Define a storage system to manage excess energy generated by the wind farm, such as batteries or pumped hydro storage.
   - Model the charging and discharging behavior of the storage system, considering factors like efficiency, capacity, and response time.

4. **Design the MPC Algorithm:**
   - Develop a C++ function to implement the MPC algorithm, which should take as input the current state of the wind farm (e.g., wind speed, turbine power output, storage level) and output control signals (e.g., turbine pitch, power curtailment, storage charging/discharging).
   - The MPC algorithm should consider the wind farm's operational constraints and objectives, such as maximizing energy production, minimizing curtailment, and maintaining grid stability.
   - Use optimization techniques (e.g., linear programming, quadratic programming) to find the optimal control inputs that minimize a cost function subject to constraints.

5. **Simulate the Wind Farm:**
   - Create a simulation loop that runs the MPC algorithm in real-time, updating the wind farm model and control inputs at regular intervals.
   - Monitor the performance of the wind farm under different wind speed scenarios and evaluate the effectiveness of the MPC system in optimizing power generation and distribution.

6. **Evaluate and Refine:**
   - Analyze the simulation results to assess the performance of the MPC system in terms of power output, energy storage utilization, and grid stability.
   - Refine the model and algorithm as needed, considering factors like model accuracy, computational efficiency, and robustness to different wind conditions.
