**B-A-B:**

ðŸŸ¥ B (Before) â€“ The Problem or Challenge

Designing a NORSOK-compliant System Control Diagram (SCD) for a LNG vaporizer system is essential for ensuring operational safety, process transparency, and automation readiness. In many early-stage projects or documentation scenarios, engineers need a textual representation of the control diagram when graphical tools arenâ€™t available. Without a structured textual formatâ€”including piping, instrumentation, and interlocksâ€”it can be difficult to communicate control logic clearly across disciplines or trace compliance with standards.

ðŸŸ© A (After) â€“ The Desired Outcome

Create a NORSOK-style System Control Diagram (SCD) using textual notation for a LNG vaporizer system. This diagram should:
	â€¢	Include major process elements (e.g., LNG feed lines, vaporizers, heaters, gas outlet)
	â€¢	Represent instrumentation and control loops with realistic tag numbers (e.g., TT101, FIC202, PSV301)
	â€¢	Clearly document interlocks (e.g., pressure high-high trip, ESD logic)
	â€¢	Indicate piping flow using arrows (-->) and group control functions logically (e.g., temperature control loop, flow regulation, safety shutdowns)

The result will be a functional, plain-text SCD layout that can support control system development and safety verification.

ðŸŸ§ B (Bridge) â€“ How to Get There
	1.	Define process flow from LNG inlet â†’ vaporizer â†’ pressure regulation â†’ gas outlet.
	2.	Assign and place instrumentation:
	â€¢	Temperature loop: TT101 â†’ TIC101 â†’ Heater Control Valve (TCV101)
	â€¢	Flow loop: FT201 â†’ FIC201 â†’ FCV201
	â€¢	Safety: PSH301 (Pressure Switch High) â†’ ESD1
	3.	Use NORSOK-style loop and tag conventions (e.g., P&ID cross-references like U-610, L-120).
	4.	Format in readable text with logical grouping and indentation. Example:

 LNG Inlet --> FT201 --> FIC201 --> FCV201 --> Vaporizer
                                       |
                                       --> TT101 --> TIC101 --> TCV101
                                               |
                                               --> PSH301 --> ESD1

**C-C-C:**

ðŸŸ¨ C (Challenge) â€“ The Obstacle

Designing a textual SCD for a complex system like a LNG vaporizer can be challenging due to the need for precise control logic, safety interlocks, and clear instrumentation representation. Without a structured format, it can be difficult to ensure compliance with NORSOK standards and maintain traceability across the project.

â¸»

ðŸŸ© C (Challenge) â€“ The Solution

To overcome this challenge, use a structured textual format that includes:
	â€¢	Process flow with clear labeling
	â€¢	Instrumentation and control loops with realistic tag numbers
	â€¢	Safety interlocks and ESD logic
	â€¢	Piping flow indicated with arrows (-->) and logical grouping

This approach ensures that the SCD is both functional and compliant with NORSOK standards, facilitating control system development and safety verification.

ðŸŸ© C (Challenge) â€“ The Outcome

The outcome of this challenge is a NORSOK-compliant textual SCD for a LNG vaporizer system that:
	â€¢	Provides a clear, structured representation of the control logic
	â€¢	Includes all necessary instrumentation, control loops, and safety interlocks
	â€¢	Is formatted in a way that supports automation and traceability

This SCD will be a valuable tool for engineers and project managers, ensuring that the LNG vaporizer system is designed and operated safely and efficiently.
