Create a self-contained program in IEC 61131-3 Structured Text to manage the sequential control of step B.2, Reaction, with specific process parameters and timers. Include the necessary control logic to call methods corresponding to each phase of the reaction, ensuring that transitions between steps are managed through appropriate conditions and timer values.

ðŸŸ¥ R (Role) â€“ Define Your Role

Act as a control systems engineer implementing ISA-88-compliant batch processes using IEC 61131-3 Structured Text.

ðŸŸ© I (Input) â€“ Information Provided

You are developing a batch control system for adhesive production, specifically focusing on step B.2: Reaction. The process includes multiple operations such as heating, mixing, and holding, each with specific parameters and timing requirements. The system must follow ISA-88 standards for modularity and procedural abstraction. Your goal is to create a self-contained Structured Text program that controls this step and integrates smoothly into the full batch recipe.

ðŸŸ§ S (Steps) â€“ Implementation Steps
	1.	Design an ISA-88-compliant recipe structure that outlines the main stages of adhesive production, with clear focus on the Reaction step.
	2.	Develop Structured Text methods or function blocks to control operations like StartHeating, StartMixing, and HoldReaction, including input parameters (e.g., temperature, speed, time).
	3.	Implement sequential control logic that manages transitions between phases using timers and real-time conditions.
	4.	Ensure the code structure is modular, with reusable components and clear state handling, consistent with ISA-88 procedural models.

ðŸŸ¦ E (Expectation) â€“ Expected Outcome

Deliver a Structured Text program that performs step B.2 of the batch adhesive recipe reliably and in compliance with ISA-88. The program should facilitate easy integration with other batch stages, support reuse of control logic, and enhance clarity, safety, and flexibility in the adhesive manufacturing process.

**Batch Adhesive Recipe:**

The ISA-88 batch control recipe for adhesive production consists of the following stages:

1. Preparation
	* Cleaning and sanitizing equipment
	* Setting up the reactor
2. Reaction (Step B.2)
	* Evacuation
	* Material charging
	* Heating
	* Mixing
	* Polymerization
	* Degassing
	* Transfer
	* Drying
3. Post-Reaction
	* Cooling
	* Final product inspection
	* Packaging

**Reaction Step (B.2) Control:**

To control the Reaction step (B.2), we will create a self-contained Structured Text program with the following methods:

1. StartEvacuation
	* Purge the reactor with an inert gas
	* Monitor pressure and vacuum levels
2. StartMaterialCharging
	* Open the charging valve
	* Monitor the mass flow rate of the material
3. StartHeating
	* Set the temperature controller to the desired heating setpoint
	* Monitor the reactor temperature
4. StartMixing
	* Set the agitator speed to the desired mixing setpoint
	* Monitor the agitator speed
5. HoldReaction
	* Maintain the reactor temperature and mixing conditions for a specified duration
	* Monitor the elapsed time
6. StartDegassing
	* Purge the reactor with an inert gas to remove dissolved gases
	* Monitor pressure and vacuum levels
7. StartTransfer
	* Open the transfer valve
	* Monitor the mass flow rate of the adhesive
8. StartDrying
	* Set the temperature controller to the desired drying setpoint
	* Monitor the reactor temperature

**Sequential Control Logic:**

The sequential control logic for the Reaction step (B.2) will be implemented using timers and real-time conditions. The program will transition between phases based on the following conditions:

1. Evacuation:
	* If the vacuum level reaches the desired value, proceed to Material Charging.
2. Material Charging:
	* If the desired mass of material has been charged, proceed to
