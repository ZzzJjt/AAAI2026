### Intent:
**Intent Summary:**  
Develop an ANN-based temperature control system for a chemical reactor that outperforms traditional PID control by handling nonlinear dynamics and disturbances, using Python to simulate the reactor, train the neural network, and compare controller performance.  

*(Focus: ANN-driven process control for reactors with disturbance rejection, coded in Python)*

### Prompt:
**Model Predictive Control for Continuous Cellulose Fiber Production Using Python:**

Explain how model predictive control (MPC) can optimize cellulose fiber production from wood, where continuous infeed and outfeed operations are required, while the material undergoes a two-stage batch process. The material is supplied at an average rate of 50 tons per hour, undergoing pre-treatment in a reactor followed by homogenization before entering a 1,000 cubic meter buffer tank. The product is extracted from the tank on demand, not at a constant rate. To minimize downtime in downstream processes, a high fill level in the tank must be maintained, despite the two-hour delay caused by upstream batch processes, making PID control unsuitable.

Develop Python code to simulate the system dynamics, including the dead time and fluctuating demand.

Implement Python code for a model predictive control (MPC) algorithm to optimize material flow, taking into account the time delay, fluctuating demand, and operational constraints.

**C-A-R-E:**

ðŸŸ¥ Cï¼ˆContextï¼‰

In continuous cellulose fiber production from wood, material is fed at a steady rate of 50 tons/hour into a two-stage batch process (pre-treatment and homogenization) before being stored in a 1,000 mÂ³ buffer tank. However, due to the batch process and a two-hour upstream delay, while the product outflow from the tank is variable and demand-driven, traditional PID control cannot ensure consistent performance. This can result in low tank levels and potential downstream process interruptions.

ðŸŸ© Aï¼ˆActionï¼‰

Explain how model predictive control (MPC) can effectively manage this production challenge by accounting for process delays and demand fluctuations. Then, develop Python code to simulate the production system, incorporating upstream batch timing, tank dynamics, and variable outfeed demand. Implement an MPC algorithm that predicts future conditions and adjusts infeed accordingly to maintain desired tank levels.

ðŸŸ¨ Rï¼ˆResultï¼‰

The MPC system should keep the buffer tank at an optimal fill level, preventing underfill or overflow, ensuring consistent downstream supply, and minimizing unplanned downtimeâ€”something PID control cannot reliably achieve in this scenario.

ðŸŸ¦ Eï¼ˆExampleï¼‰

For instance, simulate a sudden increase in product demand from the buffer tank. Show how the MPC anticipates the depletion and adjusts infeed proactivelyâ€”despite the two-hour upstream delayâ€”while PID control either reacts too late or causes oscillations in tank level.
