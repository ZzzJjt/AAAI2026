### Intent:
**Intent Summary:**  
Explain object-oriented programming (OOP) concepts (classes, methods, inheritance, polymorphism) in IEC 61131-3 V3.0 for industrial automation, including practical examples, advantages/disadvantages, and guidelines for implementation in real-time control systems.  

*(Focused on OOP extensions, not the traffic light FSM example provided.)*

### Prompt:
**Object-oriented 61131-3:**
Discuss the concept of classes and methods introduced in IEC 61131-3 Version 3.0, including a detailed explanation of their limitations, advantages, and disadvantages in the context of industrial automation. Provide a relevant example to illustrate these concepts in practice.

Explain how inheritance is implemented in IEC 61131-3, building on the previous example to show how derived classes can extend base functionality. Additionally, refine the example further to demonstrate polymorphism within this framework, discussing its practical applications and constraints.


**R-I-S-E:**

ðŸŸ¥ R (Role) â€“ Your Role

You are an experienced industrial automation engineer or PLC developer already familiar with traditional IEC 61131-3 programming. Your goal is to understand and explain the object-oriented extensions introduced in IEC 61131-3 Version 3.0, especially in terms of how they enable better modularity and abstraction in control systems.

â¸»

ðŸŸ© I (Input) â€“ What Youâ€™re Given

You are tasked with analyzing and documenting:
	â€¢	The concept of classes and methods in IEC 61131-3 V3.0
	â€¢	Their advantages, disadvantages, and limitations
	â€¢	A practical example of class usage
	â€¢	An extension of that example showing:
	â€¢	Inheritance: how subclasses extend functionality
	â€¢	Polymorphism: how base-class references can invoke subclass behavior
	â€¢	Realistic industrial considerations (e.g., performance, debugging, portability)

â¸»

ðŸŸ§ S (Steps) â€“ How to Proceed
	1.	Define key OOP concepts as applied in IEC 61131-3: class, method, inheritance, polymorphism
	2.	Illustrate usage of these features with a working example:
	â€¢	Start with a base FB_Actuator
	â€¢	Extend it into a derived FB_Valve
	â€¢	Show polymorphic method calls through base class references
	3.	Evaluate pros and cons:
	â€¢	Pros: reusability, cleaner architecture, improved testability
	â€¢	Cons: vendor support inconsistencies, execution determinism concerns
	4.	Conclude with observations on how and when to use OOP in industrial automation, such as in modular machinery, device abstraction, or protocol wrappers.

â¸»

ðŸŸ¦ E (Expectation) â€“ What You Will Deliver

You will produce a technical explanation and example-based guide that:
	â€¢	Teaches object-oriented features of IEC 61131-3 V3.0 clearly and concisely
	â€¢	Provides practical, industry-relevant examples
	â€¢	Helps teams adopt OOP in automation projects
	â€¢	Identifies best-use scenarios and cautions against overengineering in real-time environments
