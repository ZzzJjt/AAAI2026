### Intent:
The task is to create a PLC program in Structured Text that controls a single-lane underground car park entry/exit system using photoelectric sensors and traffic lights to ensure safe one-way vehicle passage by managing red/green light states based on vehicle detection.  

**Intent Summary:**  
*"Develop a safety-interlocked traffic control system for a single-lane underground car park passage using photoelectric sensors and light signals to enforce one-directional vehicle movement at a time."*  

(Key focus: **unidirectional occupancy control** via sensor-triggered light states, prioritizing collision prevention.)

### Prompt:
**Entry/Exit Control for Underground Car Park Using 61131-3 Structured Text:**

Write a PLC program in structured text (ST) according to IEC 61131-3 to control the entry and exit of an underground car park. The system uses the following sensors and actuators:

	‚Ä¢	Sensors:
	‚Ä¢	X1: Photoelectric switch at the ground floor entry/exit. It will be ON when a car passes.
	‚Ä¢	X2: Photoelectric switch at the basement entry/exit. It will be ON when a car passes.
	‚Ä¢	M1: ON for one scan cycle when a car from the ground floor passes X1.
	‚Ä¢	M2: ON for one scan cycle when a car from the basement passes X1.
	‚Ä¢	M3: ON for one scan cycle when a car from the basement passes X2.
	‚Ä¢	M4: ON for one scan cycle when a car from the ground floor passes X2.
	‚Ä¢	Intermediate Variables:
	‚Ä¢	M20: ON during the process of a car entering the passage from the ground floor.
	‚Ä¢	M30: ON during the process of a car entering the passage from the basement.
	‚Ä¢	Output Devices:
	‚Ä¢	Y1: Red lights at the entry/exit of the ground floor and the basement.
	‚Ä¢	Y2: Green lights at the entry/exit of the ground floor and the basement.

Process Description:

The entry and exit of the underground car park is controlled by a single lane passage, with traffic lights regulating car movement. The red lights (Y1) prohibit cars from entering or leaving, while the green lights (Y2) allow movement.

	‚Ä¢	When a car enters the passage from the ground floor entry, the red lights at both the ground floor and basement turn ON, while the green lights turn OFF, preventing any other cars from entering or leaving until the car passes through the passage.
	‚Ä¢	Similarly, when a car enters from the basement, the red lights will turn ON at both entry points, prohibiting other vehicles from entering or leaving until the car passes through.
	‚Ä¢	When the passage is clear, the green lights will turn ON again, allowing cars to enter or exit freely.
	‚Ä¢	Initially, the PLC should set the green lights ON and the red lights OFF to indicate free movement.

üü• C (Context) ‚Äì The Background

In an underground car park with a single-lane passage, it‚Äôs crucial to safely control vehicle entry and exit to prevent head-on collisions. The system must detect vehicles coming from both the ground floor and basement, and manage traffic lights to ensure only one car occupies the passage at a time. This can be achieved using a PLC programmed in IEC 61131-3 Structured Text, which interprets signals from photoelectric sensors and manages light outputs.

‚∏ª

üü© A (Action) ‚Äì The Implementation Task

Write a Structured Text program to control the traffic flow through the passage. Use:

Sensors:
	‚Ä¢	X1: Photoelectric switch at ground floor (ON when car passes)
	‚Ä¢	X2: Photoelectric switch at basement (ON when car passes)
	‚Ä¢	M1‚ÄìM4: Pulse flags (ON for 1 scan when car passes a certain sensor from a direction)

Memory Flags:
	‚Ä¢	M20: Passage occupied by a car entering from the ground floor
	‚Ä¢	M30: Passage occupied by a car entering from the basement

Actuators:
	‚Ä¢	Y1: Red lights (ON = stop)
	‚Ä¢	Y2: Green lights (ON = go)

Logic:
	‚Ä¢	When a car enters from either side, activate red lights (Y1 := TRUE) and deactivate green lights (Y2 := FALSE) at both ends.
	‚Ä¢	When the passage is clear, restore green lights and turn off red lights.
	‚Ä¢	Initially, the system should allow passage (Y2 := TRUE, Y1 := FALSE).

‚∏ª

üü® R (Result) ‚Äì The Expected Outcome

The program will:
	‚Ä¢	Allow only one car at a time to use the passage
	‚Ä¢	Automatically detect when the passage is occupied or cleared
	‚Ä¢	Control red and green lights to manage safe access
	‚Ä¢	Reset to a default ‚Äúready‚Äù state when the passage becomes empty
	‚Ä¢	Be suitable for real-time use in industrial or commercial garage access control

‚∏ª

üü¶ E (Example) ‚Äì Code Snippet
// Set passage occupancy
IF M1 OR M4 THEN
    M20 := TRUE; // Ground floor entry
END_IF;
IF M2 OR M3 THEN
    M30 := TRUE; // Basement entry
END_IF;

// Clear passage occupancy after exit
IF M3 OR M4 THEN
    M20 := FALSE;
END_IF;
IF M1 OR M2 THEN
    M30 := FALSE;
END_IF;

// Light control
IF M20 OR M30 THEN
    Y1 := TRUE;   // Red light ON
    Y2 := FALSE;  // Green light OFF
ELSE
    Y1 := FALSE;  // Red light OFF
    Y2 := TRUE;   // Green light ON
