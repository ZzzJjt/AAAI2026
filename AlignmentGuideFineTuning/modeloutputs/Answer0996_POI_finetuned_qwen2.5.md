### Intent:
**Intent Summary:**  
Create an IEC 61131-3 Function Block Diagram (FBD) in ASCII art to represent a feedwater control loop with an analog input (AI), TON timer, PID controller, and analog output (AO), showing signal flow from AI to PID to AO for PLC documentation or training purposes.  

*(Focus: Text-based FBD generation for a PID control loop with timed activation, emphasizing clarity and adherence to IEC 61131-3 standards.)*

### Prompt:
**IO List Steam Water Cycle:**

Create an I/O list as a table for feedwater control in a steam-water cycle in a power plant. Have as columns names, signal tagnumber, analog/digital, engineering unit, ranges, setpoint, and P&ID reference.

**T-A-G:**

ðŸŸ¥ T (Task)

Develop an I/O list table for the feedwater control system in a steam-water cycle within a power plant.

â¸»

ðŸŸ© A (Action)
	â€¢	Create a table where each row defines one I/O signal related to feedwater control.
	â€¢	Include the following columns:
	â€¢	Signal Name
	â€¢	Signal Tag Number
	â€¢	Analog/Digital
	â€¢	Engineering Unit
	â€¢	Range
	â€¢	Setpoint
	â€¢	P&ID Reference
	â€¢	Populate the list with signals such as drum level transmitters, feedwater control valves, flow transmitters, and pump status feedbacks.
	â€¢	Use realistic values for units, setpoints, and ranges to ensure engineering accuracy.
	â€¢	Organize the table to be clear, structured, and ready for use in PLC/HMI configuration or project documentation.

ðŸŸ¦ G (Goal)

Provide a complete and traceable I/O reference that supports automation design, instrumentation layout, and integration with P&ID drawingsâ€”ensuring consistency and accuracy in the implementation of the feedwater control loop.
