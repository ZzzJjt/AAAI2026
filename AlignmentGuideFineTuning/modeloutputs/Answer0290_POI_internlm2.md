### Intent:
The task is to **create a structured text program for a traffic light control system that manages standard light sequences, pedestrian crossings, and emergency vehicle prioritization while ensuring safe and efficient traffic flow**.

### Prompt:
**Traffic Light Control System Using 61131-3 Structured Text:**

Write a self-contained 61131-3 structured text program (not a function block) to control a traffic light system. The system should respond to pedestrian push buttons, allowing safe crossing by adjusting traffic light timings accordingly. Additionally, the system must detect the presence of emergency vehicles and prioritize their passage by adjusting the light sequence to provide a clear path. Implement logic to ensure smooth traffic flow while giving priority to safety and emergency response.

**C-A-R-E:**

ðŸŸ¥ C (Context) â€“ The Background

Traffic light systems must ensure safe pedestrian crossings, maintain efficient vehicle flow, and provide emergency vehicle prioritization. In smart cities and industrial environments, programmable logic controllers (PLCs) using IEC 61131-3 Structured Text can manage these complex requirements reliably. A well-structured program must integrate timing logic, sensor inputs, and conditional branching to coordinate all system elements.

ðŸŸ© A (Action) â€“ The Implementation Task

Write a self-contained Structured Text (ST) program that:
	â€¢	Operates a traffic light with standard sequences: Red â†’ Green â†’ Yellow
	â€¢	Handles pedestrian push buttons by inserting a safe red light hold for crossing
	â€¢	Detects emergency vehicles and immediately grants green signal to clear the path
	â€¢	Resumes normal traffic cycles after special events
	â€¢	Ensures non-conflicting transitions with timer-based state control

â¸»

ðŸŸ¨ R (Result) â€“ The Expected Outcome

The resulting control system will:
	â€¢	Prioritize safety by reliably managing pedestrian crossings
	â€¢	Improve response time for emergency vehicles using sensor-based overrides
	â€¢	Maintain smooth and efficient traffic flow through coordinated timing
	â€¢	Be modular, readable, and scalable, suitable for integration into broader urban traffic networks

ðŸŸª E (Example) â€“ Execution Flow

1. Traffic light starts in red.
2. If a pedestrian presses the button, the red light is extended for crossing.
3. If an emergency vehicle approaches, the light immediately switches to green to clear the path.
4. After the emergency vehicle passes, the light returns to normal operation.
5. The cycle repeats: red, green, yellow, red, ...

ðŸŸª E (Example) â€“ System Components

1. Traffic Light: A physical light system with three states (red, green, yellow).
2. Pedestrian Push Button: A sensor that detects when a pedestrian presses the button.
3. Emergency Sensor: A sensor that detects the presence of an emergency vehicle.
4. PLC: A programmable logic controller that executes the Structured Text program.
5. Communication Network: A network that connects the PLC to the sensors and traffic light system.

ðŸŸª E (Example) â€“ Safety Considerations

1. The program must ensure that the traffic light does not change states while a pedestrian is crossing.
2. The program must handle sensor failures gracefully, preventing unexpected light changes.
3. The program must be designed to handle multiple emergency vehicles without causing conflicts.
4. The program must be thoroughly tested in various scenarios to ensure safe and efficient operation.

ðŸŸª E (Example) â€“ Maintenance and Upgrades

1. The program should be modular and well-documented to facilitate maintenance and upgrades.
2. The program should be designed to accommodate future enhancements, such as additional sensors or traffic light configurations.
3. The program should be regularly reviewed and updated to incorporate new safety standards or technology advancements.
