### Intent:
**Intent Summary:**  
Create a precision-controlled real-number comparator function block in IEC 61131-3 Structured Text that compares two floating-point values up to *n* decimal places with configurable rounding, error handling, and output flags for equality/inequality, ensuring reliability in industrial PLC applications.  

*(Key focus: Configurable precision, robust error handling, and industrial reusability for floating-point comparisons.)*

### Prompt:
**Real Comparator:**
Implement a self-contained function block in IEC 61131-3 structured text to compare two real inputs up to n decimal places. Include configurable precision and error handling.


**T-A-G:**

ðŸŸ¥ T (Task)

Create a self-contained function block in IEC 61131-3 Structured Text to compare two REAL numbers with precision control up to a user-defined number of decimal places.

â¸»

ðŸŸ© A (Action)
	â€¢	Accept the following inputs:
	â€¢	Input1 : REAL
	â€¢	Input2 : REAL
	â€¢	Precision : INT â€“ number of decimal places for comparison
	â€¢	Enable : BOOL â€“ triggers execution
	â€¢	Internally calculate a scaling factor:
\text{Scale} := 10^{\text{Precision}}
	â€¢	Multiply each input by Scale, round the results, and convert them to integers
	â€¢	Compare the two values and set the appropriate output flags:
	â€¢	Equal : BOOL
	â€¢	Greater : BOOL
	â€¢	Less : BOOL
	â€¢	Error : BOOL (if Precision < 0 or Enable = FALSE)
	â€¢	Ensure the logic is modular, scan-cycle safe, and easily reusable

ðŸŸ¦ G (Goal)

Deliver a robust and reusable real-number comparator function block that reliably handles floating-point comparisons with configurable precision. This will improve accuracy and reliability in PLC-based control applications involving setpoint verification, sensor thresholds, and quality control decisions.

ðŸŸ¨ E (Expected Output)

The function block should output the following flags:

â€¢	Equal : BOOL
â€¢	Greater : BOOL
â€¢	Less : BOOL
â€¢	Error : BOOL (if Precision < 0 or Enable = FALSE)

These flags indicate whether the two inputs are equal, one is greater, or one is less than the other, and whether there was an error due to invalid input or disabled operation.
