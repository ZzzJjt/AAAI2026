### Intent:
**Intent Summary:**  
Develop an ISA-88-compliant batch control program in Structured Text to manage the adhesive production reaction phase (B.2), including method calls for heating, mixing, and environment control, with modular logic for phase transitions based on timers and process conditions.  

*(Focus: Code generation for precise, sequential control of a batch reaction step adhering to ISA-88 standards.)*

### Prompt:
**Batch Adhesive:**

Develop an ISA-88 batch control recipe for the production of adhesive, detailing the stages involved in the process. Create a self-contained program in IEC 61131-3 Structured Text to manage the sequential control of step B.2, Reaction, with specific process parameters and timers. Include the necessary control logic to call methods corresponding to each phase of the reaction, ensuring that transitions between steps are managed through appropriate conditions and timer values.

Incorporate detailed content for calling the methods that govern specific operations, such as heating, mixing, and maintaining the reaction environment. Additionally, discuss the integration of ISA-88 standards in batch process control, focusing on how the structured text program facilitates modularity and flexibility in controlling the adhesive production process.

**C-A-R-E:**

ðŸŸ¥ C (Context) â€“ Background Situation

Adhesive production is typically carried out in batch mode and involves multiple well-defined stages, including a critical reaction phase where variables such as temperature, mixing intensity, and duration must be precisely controlled. Implementing ISA-88 standards ensures modularity and reusability in batch control systems, especially when programmed using IEC 61131-3 Structured Text.

ðŸŸ© A (Action) â€“ Task to Perform

Develop an ISA-88 batch control recipe for adhesive production, detailing each stage of the process. Focus on implementing step B.2: Reaction as a self-contained program in Structured Text, complete with process parameters, timers, and logic for transitioning between sub-steps. Create structured method calls to handle key operations such as heating, mixing, and maintaining the reaction environment, and design the control logic to manage phase transitions based on real-time conditions and timer values.

ðŸŸ¨ R (Result) â€“ Expected Outcome

The program should reflect ISA-88 principles by being modular, maintainable, and reusable. Each phase of the reaction should be clearly defined, and the structured code should ensure reliable execution of the batch step with accurate parameter tracking and safe sequencing of operations.

ðŸŸ¦ E (Example) â€“ Concrete Illustration

For instance, during the B.2 Reaction step, the program might call StartHeating(Temp := 85) and begin a timer; once the timer expires and temperature is stable, it could invoke StartMixing(Speed := 600) for a set duration, followed by HoldReaction(Time := 20 min). Transitions between phases are managed using IF conditions and timers, ensuring strict adherence to the recipe logic.
