### Intent:
**Intent Summary:**  
Create an IEC 61131-3 compliant Sequential Function Chart (SFC) in ASCII art to model a traffic light's cyclic operation (green → yellow → red) with timed transitions (5s, 2s, 5s) for documentation or PLC implementation.

### Prompt:
**SFC Traffic Light:**

Create a 61131-3 sequential function chart in ASCII art for a traffic light. Include proper delays for switching the lights.

**C-A-R-E:**

🟥 C (Context) – Background Situation

Sequential Function Charts (SFCs) are part of the IEC 61131-3 standard and are widely used to describe step-by-step control logic in industrial systems. For simple systems like traffic lights, SFCs help clarify the sequence of light changes and the timing involved. In situations where graphical tools are unavailable—such as technical documentation or text-based environments—using ASCII art allows engineers to express SFC logic in a readable, structured way.

⸻

🟩 A (Action) – Task to Perform

Create an ASCII art Sequential Function Chart (SFC) for a traffic light system using IEC 61131-3 conventions. The chart should:
	•	Include three main steps: Green, Yellow, and Red lights
	•	Represent transitions between these steps based on timer conditions
	•	Integrate TON timers to enforce proper delays (e.g., 5s green, 2s yellow, 5s red)
	•	Use clear block formatting and arrows to show the flow of execution
	•	Label timers and transitions with standard IEC logic where applicable

⸻

🟨 R (Result) – Expected Outcome

The final output should be a clean, readable ASCII SFC that illustrates the timed cycle of the traffic light logic. This diagram can be used for:
	•	Code planning before PLC implementation
	•	Control logic documentation
	•	Teaching or presenting IEC 61131-3 concepts in plain text environments

🟦 E (Example) – Concrete Illustration

[Step1] Green Light  
   TON tGreen (PT := T#5s)  
     |  
     V (tGreen.Q)  
[Step2] Yellow Light  
   TON tYellow (PT := T#2s)  
     |  
     V (tYellow.Q)  
[Step3] Red Light  
   TON tRed (PT := T#5s)  
     |  
     V (tRed.Q)  
 --> Loop back to Step1

🔄 E (Evaluation) – Assessing Success

The success of this task can be evaluated by:
	•	Checking that the ASCII SFC accurately represents the traffic light logic
	•	Ensuring that the timers and transitions are correctly implemented
	•	Verifying that the flow of execution is clear and easy to follow
	•	Confirming that the SFC can be used for documentation or PLC implementation

⸻

🔍 E (Enhancement) – Going Beyond

To enhance the SFC, consider:
	•	Adding comments to explain the logic or timer values
	•	Using different ASCII characters for better readability (e.g., using arrows for transitions)
	•	Including additional steps or conditions for a more complex traffic light system
	•	Exploring other IEC 61131-3 chart types (e.g., Function Block Diagrams) for comparison

📝 E (Evidence) – Proof of Completion

Provide a screenshot or a text-based representation of the completed ASCII SFC for the traffic light system. The SFC should be clear, well-structured, and easy to understand.
