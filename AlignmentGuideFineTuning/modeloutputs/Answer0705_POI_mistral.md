### Intent:
The task is to implement a model predictive control (MPC) system in Python that optimizes continuous cellulose fiber production by managing material flow through a two-stage batch process with time delays and fluctuating demand, ensuring high buffer tank levels to prevent downstream disruptions.  

(Key elements: MPC, hybrid continuous-batch process, delay compensation, demand variability, tank level maintenance)

### Prompt:
**Model Predictive Control for Continuous Cellulose Fiber Production Using Python:**

Explain how model predictive control (MPC) can optimize cellulose fiber production from wood, where continuous infeed and outfeed operations are required, while the material undergoes a two-stage batch process. The material is supplied at an average rate of 50 tons per hour, undergoing pre-treatment in a reactor followed by homogenization before entering a 1,000 cubic meter buffer tank. The product is extracted from the tank on demand, not at a constant rate. To minimize downtime in downstream processes, a high fill level in the tank must be maintained, despite the two-hour delay caused by upstream batch processes, making PID control unsuitable.

Develop Python code to simulate the system dynamics, including the dead time and fluctuating demand.

Implement Python code for a model predictive control (MPC) algorithm to optimize material flow, taking into account the time delay, fluctuating demand, and operational constraints.

**R-T-F:**
