### Intent:
**Intent Summary:**  
Design a Structured Text function block to compute eigenvalues of a 10×10 matrix for PLCs, addressing numerical stability, convergence, and real-time performance constraints with clear documentation and fail-safes.  

*(Focus: Eigenvalue computation in PLCs, balancing accuracy with embedded limitations.)*

### Prompt:
**Eigenvalue:**

Design a self-contained function block in IEC 61131-3 Structured Text to compute the eigenvalues of a 10x10 matrix. Ensure the function block is optimized for performance and includes detailed comments to explain the steps involved in the eigenvalue calculation. Discuss potential challenges related to numerical stability, convergence, and computational efficiency when implementing this algorithm in a PLC environment, particularly for real-time applications.

🟥 R (Role) – Your Role

You are a PLC software developer or control systems engineer responsible for implementing a mathematical function block to compute eigenvalues of a 10×10 matrix using IEC 61131-3 Structured Text, optimized for use in real-time automation environments.

⸻

🟩 I (Input) – What You’re Given

You need to design a function block that:
	•	Accepts a 10×10 REAL matrix as input
	•	Computes and outputs the eigenvalues in a 10-element REAL array
	•	Includes comments explaining the algorithm steps (e.g., normalization, iteration, convergence check)
	•	Handles limitations related to:
	•	Numerical stability (e.g., rounding errors, floating-point limits)
	•	Convergence of iterative algorithms
	•	Execution time and performance in PLC environments

⸻

🟧 S (Steps) – What You Need to Do
	1.	Choose an appropriate algorithm (e.g., Power Iteration or a simplified QR method) suited for a PLC’s processing capabilities
	2.	Create a function block structure with:
	•	Matrix input: MatrixInput : ARRAY[1..10, 1..10] OF REAL
	•	Eigenvalue output: EigenValues : ARRAY[1..10] OF REAL
	3.	Implement the core logic:
	•	Initialize a vector
	•	Perform matrix-vector multiplication
	•	Normalize the vector
	•	Estimate the dominant eigenvalue
	•	Repeat with convergence threshold or iteration limit
	4.	Include detailed inline comments explaining:
	•	Each step’s mathematical purpose
	•	How you ensure convergence
	•	How fail-safes are built in for real-time performance
	5.	Optionally: create a fallback output or diagnostic flag if the algorithm doesn’t converge within a safe number of cycles

⸻

🟦 E (Expectation) – What Success Looks Like

You produce a modular, well-documented function block that can be integrated into PLC projects needing matrix analysis—especially useful in model-based control, signal processing, or system diagnostics. The function block:
	•	Provides reasonably accurate eigenvalues under PLC constraints
	•	Performs reliably within execution cycle time limits
	•	Fails safely and predictably if it detects instability or divergence
