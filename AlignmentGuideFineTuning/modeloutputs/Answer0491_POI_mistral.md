ðŸŸ¥ R (Role) â€“ Your Role

You are a PLC software developer or control systems engineer responsible for implementing a mathematical function block to compute eigenvalues of a 10Ã—10 matrix using IEC 61131-3 Structured Text, optimized for use in real-time automation environments.

ðŸŸ© I (Input) â€“ What Youâ€™re Given

You need to design a function block that:
	â€¢	Accepts a 10Ã—10 REAL matrix as input
	â€¢	Computes and outputs the eigenvalues in a 10-element REAL array
	â€¢	Includes comments explaining the algorithm steps (e.g., normalization, iteration, convergence check)
	â€¢	Handles limitations related to:
	â€¢	Numerical stability (e.g., rounding errors, floating-point limits)
	â€¢	Convergence of iterative algorithms
	â€¢	Execution time and performance in PLC environments

â¸»

ðŸŸ§ S (Steps) â€“ What You Need to Do
	1.	Choose an appropriate algorithm (e.g., Power Iteration or a simplified QR method) suited for a PLCâ€™s processing capabilities
	2.	Create a function block structure with:
	â€¢	Matrix input: MatrixInput : ARRAY[1..10, 1..10] OF REAL
	â€¢	Eigenvalue output: EigenValues : ARRAY[1..10] OF REAL
	3.	Implement the core logic:
	â€¢	Initialize a vector
	â€¢	Perform matrix-vector multiplication
	â€¢	Normalize the vector
	â€¢	Estimate the dominant eigenvalue
	â€¢	Repeat with convergence threshold or iteration limit
	4.	Include detailed inline comments explaining:
	â€¢	Each stepâ€™s mathematical purpose
	â€¢	How you ensure convergence
	â€¢	How fail-safes are built in for real-time performance
	5.	Optionally: create a fallback output or diagnostic flag if the algorithm doesnâ€™t converge within a safe number of cycles

â¸»

ðŸŸ¦ E (Expectation) â€“ What Success Looks Like

You produce a modular, well-documented function block that can be integrated into PLC projects needing matrix analysisâ€”especially useful in model-based control, signal processing, or system diagnostics. The function block:
	â€¢	Provides reasonably accurate eigenvalues under PLC constraints
	â€¢	Performs reliably within execution cycle time limits
	â€¢	Fails safely and predictably if it detects instability or divergence
