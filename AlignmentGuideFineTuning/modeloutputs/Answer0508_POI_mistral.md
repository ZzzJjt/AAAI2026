🟥 R (Role) – Your Role

You are a PLC programmer or control systems engineer developing statistical function blocks in IEC 61131-3 Structured Text to support real-time probabilistic event analysis in industrial systems.

⸻

🟩 I (Input) – What You’re Given

You need to implement a function block that calculates the Poisson distribution probability, given:
	•	Lambda : REAL — the expected number of events (mean rate, λ)
	•	K : INT — the number of actual events observed

The output should be:
	•	Probability : REAL — the probability that K events occur given a rate Lambda
	•	Based on the Poisson probability mass function:
P(k; \lambda) = \frac{e^{-\lambda} \cdot \lambda^k}{k!}

You must also consider:
	•	Overflow and precision loss with large values of λ or k
	•	Executing efficiently within a real-time PLC scan cycle
	•	Proper domain checks (e.g., Lambda > 0, K ≥ 0)

⸻

🟧 S (Steps) – What You Need to Do
	1.	Define a function block named PoissonProbability with the following structure:
 FUNCTION_BLOCK PoissonProbability
VAR_INPUT
    Lambda : REAL;
    K : INT;
END_VAR
VAR_OUTPUT
    Probability : REAL;
END_VAR
	2.	Add logic to calculate factorial for K:
 VAR
    i : INT;
    Factorial : REAL := 1.0;
END_VAR

FOR i := 1 TO K DO
    Factorial := Factorial * i;
END_FOR;
	3.	Compute the Poisson probability:
 IF (Lambda > 0) AND (K >= 0) THEN
    Probability := EXP(-Lambda) * POW(Lambda, K) / Factorial;
ELSE
    Probability := 0.0;
END_IF;
	4.	Add inline comments explaining:
	•	Each step of the Poisson formula
	•	Why factorial is manually computed (no built-in factorial in ST)
	•	How floating-point math affects precision
	•	Consideration of upper limits for K to prevent overflow

⸻

🟦 E (Expectation) – What Success Looks Like

You deliver a compact and accurate function block that:
	•	Computes Poisson probabilities reliably for typical values of Lambda and K
	•	Avoids crashing or incorrect output for edge cases (e.g. negative inputs)
	•	Executes quickly enough for inclusion in real-time event monitoring applications
	•	Can be reused in use cases such as:
	•	Predicting machine failure rates
	•	Sensor event tracking over time intervals
	•	Process bottleneck analysis

🟨 N (Notes) – Additional Information

	•	The Poisson distribution is a discrete probability distribution that describes the probability of a given number of events occurring in a fixed interval of time or space, if these events occur with a known average rate and independently of the time since the last event.
	•	The Poisson distribution is often used in situations where the number of events in an interval is small relative to the total number of opportunities for the event to occur.
	•	In industrial systems, the Poisson distribution can be used to model the occurrence of events such as machine failures, sensor readings, or production defects.
	•	The Poisson distribution is memoryless, meaning that the probability of an event occurring in a given interval does not depend on the number of events that have occurred in previous intervals.
	•	The Poisson distribution can be approximated using the normal distribution for large values of λ, but this approximation becomes less accurate as λ decreases.
	•	When implementing the Poisson distribution in a real-time PLC, it is important to consider the computational requirements and ensure that the function block can execute within the available scan cycle time.
	•	When working with large values of λ or K, it may be necessary to use floating-point arithmetic, which can introduce rounding errors and loss of precision. To mitigate this, it is important to use appropriate data types and to consider the impact of floating-point math on the final result.
	•	When working with large values of K, it may be necessary to limit the maximum value of K to prevent overflow errors. This can be done by setting an upper limit on K in the function block or by using a logarithmic approximation of the Poisson distribution.
	•	When working with small values of λ, it may be necessary to use a different probability distribution, such as the geometric distribution, which is better suited for modeling rare events.
	•	When using the Poisson distribution in a real-world application, it is important to validate the assumptions of the distribution and to consider other factors that may affect the probability of events occurring, such as environmental conditions, equipment wear, and operator error.
