### Intent:
**Intent Summary:**  
Develop an IEC 61131-3 Structured Text PLC program for a pick-and-place robot with interlocked manual (step-by-step control) and auto (timed sequence) modes, managing conveyor A to B transfers safely.  

*(Key focus: Mode interlocking, manual/auto logic separation, timed auto sequence, and safety.)*

### Prompt:
**Pick-and-Place Application for a Robot Using 61131-3 Structured Text:**

Write a PLC program in structured text (ST) according to IEC 61131-3 standards for a pick-and-place robotic application with two conveyors, following the process described below:

Process Description:

The system operates in two modes: Manual Mode and Auto Mode. These modes are interlocked, meaning only one can be active at any time.

	1.	Manual Mode:
	â€¢	When the Manual button is pressed, the robotic arm will execute the following steps in response to individual manual commands:
	â€¢	Clip: Clip the product from conveyor A.
	â€¢	Transfer: Move the product to conveyor B.
	â€¢	Release: Release the product onto conveyor B, allowing it to be carried away.
	2.	Auto Mode:
	â€¢	When the Auto button is pressed, the robotic arm will execute the entire pick-and-place process automatically:
	â€¢	Clip: Clip the product from conveyor A and hold it.
	â€¢	Transfer: Transfer the product to conveyor B (this action takes 2 seconds).
	â€¢	Release: Release the product onto conveyor B.
	â€¢	The auto process completes after one cycle, but can be re-triggered by pressing the Auto button again.

The system should ensure that manual and auto modes cannot operate simultaneously, using interlocking logic to prevent conflicts between the two modes.

**R-I-S-E:**

ðŸŸ¥ R (Role) â€“ Your Role

You are a PLC programmer responsible for developing a Structured Text (ST) program according to IEC 61131-3 standards. Your goal is to implement control logic for a pick-and-place robotic arm with two operating modes: Manual and Auto, while ensuring interlocks and safe operation.

ðŸŸ© I (Input) â€“ What Youâ€™re Given

ðŸ”˜ Mode Selection:
	â€¢	BtnManual: Activates Manual Mode
	â€¢	BtnAuto: Activates Auto Mode
	â€¢	Only one mode may be active at a time (interlocked)

ðŸŽ® Manual Mode Commands:
	â€¢	CmdClip: Pick product from Conveyor A
	â€¢	CmdTransfer: Move product to Conveyor B
	â€¢	CmdRelease: Drop product on Conveyor B

ðŸ¤– Auto Mode Sequence (triggered by Auto button):
	â€¢	Clip â†’ Transfer (2-second delay) â†’ Release
	â€¢	Performs one complete cycle per trigger

ðŸš¦ Outputs (you define the actions):
	â€¢	Robot performs tasks as directed by mode-specific logic

â¸»

ðŸŸ§ S (Steps) â€“ What You Need to Do
	1.	Implement Mode Interlock Logic
	â€¢	When BtnManual is pressed, activate ManualMode and disable AutoMode.
	â€¢	When BtnAuto is pressed, activate AutoMode and disable ManualMode.
	2.	Handle Manual Mode Logic
	â€¢	Respond to CmdClip, CmdTransfer, and CmdRelease independently.
	â€¢	Robot should perform only the task issued by the corresponding button.
	â€¢	No sequence or delay logic is required in manual mode.
	3.	Handle Auto Mode Logic
	â€¢	On rising edge of BtnAuto, set AutoTrigger := TRUE.
	â€¢	Use a state machine to perform:
	â€¢	State 0: Clip
	â€¢	State 1: Transfer (wait 2 seconds using a TON timer)
	â€¢	State 2: Release and reset the sequence
	4.	Ensure Safety and Robustness
	â€¢	Reset timers and state machine at the end of each Auto cycle
	â€¢	Prevent overlapping commands or simultaneous mode activation

â¸»

ðŸŸ¦ E (Expectation) â€“ What Success Looks Like

Your final program will:
	â€¢	Ensure safe, interlocked switching between Manual and Auto modes
	â€¢	Allow step-by-step control of the robot in Manual mode
	â€¢	Execute a timed, automated pick-and-place sequence in Auto mode
	â€¢	Be easily extensible for status indicators, alarms, or cycle counters
	â€¢	Follow best practices in IEC 61131-3 Structured Text
