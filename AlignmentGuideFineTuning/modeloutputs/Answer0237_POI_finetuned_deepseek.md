### Intent:
**Intent Summary:**  
Develop an IEC 61131-3 function block in Structured Text (ST) that wraps a C-based OPC UA client (using open62541) to enable PLCs to securely connect to OPC UA servers, with configurable inputs (Execute, ServerUrl, Timeout) and status outputs (Done, Busy, Error, ErrorID) for robust industrial communication.  

**Key Focus:**  
- Bridge C-code OPC UA functionality to PLC logic via ST.  
- Handle connection lifecycle, timeout, and error mapping.  
- Ensure deterministic integration for industrial automation.

### Prompt:
**OPC UA Client Implementation Using C and IEC 61131-3 Structured Text:**

Develop C-code for an OPC UA client, then wrap it into an IEC 61131-based function block written in structured text (ST). The function block should have the following input pins: Execute (type: BOOL), ServerUrl (type: STRING[255]), and Timeout (type: TIME). The output pins should include Done (type: BOOL), Busy (type: BOOL), Error (type: BOOL), and ErrorID (type: DWORD). In your explanation, describe how the C-code interfaces with the OPC UA server, how the function block manages communication with the server, and how error handling is implemented. Provide details on how to integrate this function block within an IEC 61131-3 environment for reliable client-server communication.

**C-A-R-E:**

ðŸŸ¥ C (Context) â€“ The Background

OPC UA is a widely adopted communication standard for industrial automation, offering secure, platform-independent connectivity between devices and control systems. However, many PLC environments lack built-in OPC UA client functionality, requiring custom integration using external C libraries and Structured Text (ST) to bridge the communication between the PLC and the OPC UA server.

â¸»

ðŸŸ© A (Action) â€“ The Implementation Task

Develop a C-based OPC UA client using a standard library (e.g., open62541) to manage connections, requests, and responses with an OPC UA server. Wrap this client logic into a callable module and expose it to an IEC 61131-3 environment as a Structured Text function block. The function block should include:

Inputs:
	â€¢	Execute (BOOL) â€“ Triggers the connection process
	â€¢	ServerUrl (STRING[255]) â€“ Specifies the target OPC UA server
	â€¢	Timeout (TIME) â€“ Defines the allowable wait period for connection

Outputs:
	â€¢	Done (BOOL) â€“ Indicates successful execution
	â€¢	Busy (BOOL) â€“ Signals ongoing communication
	â€¢	Error (BOOL) â€“ Flags any failure during execution
	â€¢	ErrorID (DWORD) â€“ Returns the relevant error code

The function block must manage internal communication state, map C return values to PLC-readable flags, and provide predictable results for integration into deterministic control logic.

â¸»

ðŸŸ¨ R (Result) â€“ The Expected Outcome

The resulting solution enables a PLC program to reliably initiate and manage OPC UA client connections, with built-in execution control and error handling. It provides clear status feedback to the automation engineer, allowing seamless integration into broader machine or process workflows that rely on real-time data exchange over OPC UA.

â¸»

ðŸŸ¦ E (Example) â€“ A Practical Use Case

For example, in a production line application, the ST program sets Execute := TRUE to start a connection to the OPC UA server at opc.tcp://192.168.1.100:4840. The C client handles the session creation. If successful, Done := TRUE is set and process variables are exchanged. If the server is unavailable or times out, Error := TRUE and ErrorID := 0x02 (e.g., timeout) are returned, enabling the PLC to trigger a retry or alarm without freezing execution.
