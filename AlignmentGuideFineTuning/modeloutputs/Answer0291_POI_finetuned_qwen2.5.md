### Intent:
**Intent Summary:**  
Develop an IEC 61131-3 Structured Text PLC program for an automatic car wash station that safely initiates washing only when a car is detected and no humans are present, immediately halts on human detection with an alarm, and resumes operation only after the area is clear.  

*(Key focus: Safety interlocks, state management, and real-time reaction to human presence.)*

### Prompt:
**Automatic Car Wash Station Control Using 61131-3 Structured Text:**

Write a PLC program in structured text (ST) according to IEC 61131-3 standards to control an automatic car wash station with a single wash bay. The system should use a sensor to detect the presence of a car. Once the car is detected and no human is present in the wash area, the system should initiate the car wash process. If a human is detected within the car wash area at any point, the station should immediately stop the wash process, trigger an alarm, and remain in a safe state until the area is clear.

**C-A-R-E:**

ðŸŸ¥ C (Context) â€“ The Background

An automatic car wash station must operate efficiently while ensuring safety compliance, particularly when human presence is detected within the wash bay. PLCs programmed using IEC 61131-3 Structured Text (ST) are ideal for implementing reliable, real-time control logic. Without proper interlocks and state management, the wash process could pose serious safety risks if activated while a person is inside the wash area.

ðŸŸ© A (Action) â€“ The Implementation Task

Develop a PLC program in Structured Text (ST) that meets the following criteria:
	â€¢	Inputs:
	â€¢	CarPresentSensor : BOOL â€” detects the presence of a vehicle
	â€¢	HumanDetectedSensor : BOOL â€” detects a person in the wash area
	â€¢	Outputs:
	â€¢	WashActive : BOOL â€” controls wash cycle activation
	â€¢	AlarmActive : BOOL â€” triggers safety alarm
	â€¢	SafeToRun : BOOL â€” governs whether the wash cycle can be safely initiated
	â€¢	Control Logic:
	â€¢	Start the wash process only if:
	â€¢	A car is present and
	â€¢	No human is detected and
	â€¢	The system is in a safe-to-run state
	â€¢	Immediately stop the wash, set AlarmActive := TRUE, and block any further operation if a person is detected
	â€¢	Allow operation to resume only after the wash is off and the area is clear

â¸»

ðŸŸ¨ R (Result) â€“ The Expected Outcome

The resulting PLC logic will:
	â€¢	Prevent any unsafe operation of the car wash
	â€¢	React immediately to the presence of a human by halting the system and raising an alarm
	â€¢	Stay in a safe interlocked state until the area is verified to be clear
	â€¢	Provide clear outputs (WashActive, AlarmActive, SafeToRun) that can be connected to actuators, HMI displays, or safety relays
	â€¢	Be written in a modular and maintainable format suitable for further expansion (e.g., timed wash stages)

â¸»

ðŸŸ¦ E (Example) â€“ A Practical Code Snippet
CarPresent := CarPresentSensor;
HumanDetected := HumanDetectedSensor;

IF HumanDetected THEN
    WashActive := FALSE;
    AlarmActive := TRUE;
    SafeToRun := FALSE;
ELSIF CarPresent AND NOT HumanDetected AND SafeToRun THEN
    WashActive := TRUE;
    AlarmActive := FALSE;
END_IF;

// Allow system to reset once area is clear and wash has stopped
IF NOT HumanDetected AND NOT WashActive THEN
    SafeToRun := TRUE;
END_IF;
This code ensures failsafe behavior while allowing automatic operation to resume only under controlled conditions. It forms the basis of a scalable, standards-compliant solution for a single-bay car wash system.

**Intent summary:**  
Develop a PLC program in IEC 61131-3 Structured Text to control a car wash station with safety interlocks, ensuring that the wash process only runs when no humans are present and a car is detected.

**C-A-R-E:**

ðŸŸ¥ C (Context) â€“ The Background

In a car wash station, safety is of utmost importance. Without proper interlocks, a car wash machine could potentially operate while a human is present, posing serious risks. A PLC programmed using IEC 61131-3 Structured Text (ST) can ensure safe and efficient operation by monitoring the presence of both the car and the human. The system should start the wash process only when a car is detected and no human is present, and immediately stop the wash if a human is detected, triggering an alarm and maintaining a safe state until the area is clear.
