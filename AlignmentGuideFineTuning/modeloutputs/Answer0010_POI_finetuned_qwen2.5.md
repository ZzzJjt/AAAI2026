### Prompt:
**Statistical Process Control for Steel Manufacturing Using Python:**

Develop Python code to implement a statistical process control (SPC) system for monitoring and optimizing the quality of steel manufacturing processes. The code should track key quality metrics such as tensile strength, thickness, and surface finish in real-time, using control charts and other SPC tools to detect and respond to process variations. Implement alarms for out-of-control conditions, and suggest corrective actions to minimize defects and ensure product consistency.

Simulate the steel manufacturing process, and demonstrate how SPC can be used to maintain high-quality production standards while minimizing waste and process variability.

**B-A-B:**

ðŸŸ¥ Bï¼ˆBeforeï¼‰

In steel manufacturing, maintaining consistent product quality is challenging due to variability in factors like tensile strength, thickness, and surface finish. Without proper monitoring, these variations can lead to increased waste, product defects, and customer dissatisfaction.

ðŸŸ© Aï¼ˆAfterï¼‰

Develop a statistical process control (SPC) system using Python that monitors key quality metrics in real time, detects out-of-control conditions using control charts and statistical rules, and suggests corrective actions to maintain consistent, high-quality steel products with minimal waste.

ðŸŸ§ Bï¼ˆBridgeï¼‰

Write Python code to simulate the steel manufacturing process and implement SPC tools such as XÌ„ and R charts, control limits, and trend analysis. Include logic for triggering alarms when variations exceed control thresholds, and suggest data-driven adjustments. Demonstrate how this system helps operators maintain quality and reduce process variability during production.

Steel manufacturing involves complex processes where maintaining consistent quality is critical. Fluctuations in key metrics such as tensile strength, thickness, and surface finish can lead to product defects, increased waste, and customer dissatisfaction.

The Python-based SPC system will enable real-time monitoring of key quality metrics in steel manufacturing. It will detect process variations early, trigger alarms for out-of-control conditions, and recommend corrective actions to minimize defects and waste. This will result in improved product consistency, reduced variability, and enhanced overall quality control in the manufacturing process.

Simulate a steel manufacturing process where tensile strength, thickness, and surface finish are monitored over time. Implement SPC tools such as XÌ„ and R charts to track these metrics and detect any deviations from the control limits. For instance, if tensile strength exceeds the upper control limit, trigger an alarm and suggest reducing the heating temperature to stabilize the process. This example demonstrates how SPC can be used to maintain high-quality production standards while minimizing waste and process variability.
