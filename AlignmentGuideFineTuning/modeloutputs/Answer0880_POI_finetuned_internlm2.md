ðŸŸ© A (Action) â€“ How to Do It
	1.	Define a function block called SplineInterpolator with:
	â€¢	Inputs:
	â€¢	X : ARRAY[1..N] OF REAL â€“ known x-values
	â€¢	Y : ARRAY[1..N] OF REAL â€“ corresponding y-values
	â€¢	TargetX : REAL â€“ the x-value at which to interpolate
	â€¢	Output:
	â€¢	InterpolatedY : REAL â€“ the result of spline interpolation
	2.	Implement logic to perform cubic spline interpolation:
	â€¢	Identify the correct interval for TargetX between X[i] and X[i+1]
	â€¢	Use precomputed spline coefficients (A[i], B[i], C[i], D[i]) to evaluate:
InterpolatedY = A[i] + B[i](x - X[i]) + C[i](x - X[i])^2 + D[i](x - X[i])^3
	3.	Ensure the implementation is modular:
	â€¢	Coefficients may be computed externally and passed in or initialized once
	â€¢	Runtime logic is optimized for real-time scan cycles
	â€¢	Add comments explaining the math and implementation decisions
	4.	Address challenges:
	â€¢	Handle boundary conditions and extrapolation safely
	â€¢	Use efficient logic for indexing and evaluating the correct segment
	â€¢	Maintain precision without excessive memory or processing overhead
