### Intent:
"Develop a fuzzy logic control system in MATLAB to regulate a chemical reactor's temperature, pressure, and reaction rate, with comparison against PID control under simulated disturbances."

### Prompt:
**Model Predictive Control for Aircraft Trajectory Using MATLAB:**

Develop MATLAB code to implement a model predictive control (MPC) algorithm for optimizing the trajectory of an aircraft. Ensure that the control scheme accounts for dynamic constraints, fuel efficiency, and external disturbances, while maintaining flight safety and performance objectives.

**R-I-S-E:**

ðŸŸ¥ Rï¼ˆRoleï¼‰

Act as an aerospace control systems engineer specializing in trajectory optimization and predictive control using MATLAB.

ðŸŸ© Iï¼ˆInputï¼‰

You are tasked with developing a control system for aircraft trajectory optimization. The system must account for dynamic constraints, fuel efficiency, external disturbances (e.g., wind), and ensure compliance with safety and performance requirements. MATLAB will be used for both modeling and implementation.

ðŸŸ§ Sï¼ˆStepsï¼‰
	1.	Model the aircraftâ€™s dynamics in MATLAB, incorporating variables such as position, velocity, control inputs, and external forces.
	2.	Formulate a model predictive control (MPC) scheme that includes constraints on system behavior and objectives related to fuel efficiency and flight safety.
	3.	Implement the MPC algorithm and simulate various flight scenarios with disturbances.
	4.	Evaluate the systemâ€™s ability to maintain optimal trajectory under different operational conditions.

ðŸŸ¦ Eï¼ˆExpectationï¼‰

The resulting MATLAB system should demonstrate that the MPC algorithm can optimize aircraft trajectory while respecting constraints and reacting adaptively to disturbancesâ€”enhancing fuel efficiency and maintaining flight safety.

**MATLAB Code for Fuzzy Logic Control System:**

```matlab
% Define fuzzy sets for temperature, pressure, and reaction rate
temp_sets = {'low', 'medium', 'high'};
press_sets = {'low', 'medium', 'high'};
rate_sets = {'slow', 'medium', 'fast'};

% Define fuzzy rules based on expert knowledge or data analysis
rules = [
    'IF temp IS low AND press IS low THEN rate IS slow',
    'IF temp IS low AND press IS medium THEN rate IS medium',
    'IF temp IS low AND press IS high THEN rate IS fast',
    'IF temp IS medium AND press IS low THEN rate IS medium',
    'IF temp IS medium AND press IS medium THEN rate IS medium',
    'IF temp IS medium AND press IS high THEN rate IS fast',
    'IF temp IS high AND press IS low THEN rate IS fast',
    'IF temp IS high AND press IS medium THEN rate IS fast',
    'IF temp IS high AND press IS high THEN rate IS fast'
];

% Create a fuzzy logic system
fis = mamfis('Name', 'ChemicalReactorControl', 'NumInputs', 3, 'NumOutputs', 1);

% Add input variables
addInput(fis, 'Temperature', 'Range', [0, 100], 'MembershipFunctions', temp_sets);
addInput(fis, 'Pressure', 'Range', [0, 100], 'MembershipFunctions', press_sets);
addInput(fis, 'ReactionRate', 'Range', [0, 100], 'MembershipFunctions', rate_sets);

% Add output variable
addOutput(fis, 'ControlSignal', 'Range', [-100, 100]);

% Add rules to the fuzzy system
for i = 1:length(rules)
    addRule(fis, rules{i});
end

% Simulate the fuzzy logic system with disturbances
disturbances = [10, 20, 30]; % Example disturbances
inputs = [50, 50, 50]; % Initial inputs
outputs = zeros(1, length(disturbances));

for i = 1:length(disturbances)
    inputs = [inputs; disturbances(i)];
    outputs(i) = evalfis(fis, inputs(i+1:end));
end

% Plot the results
