### Intent:
**Intent Summary:**  
Create a text-based P&ID for a power plant's steam-water cycle, detailing equipment, instrumentation, control loops, and tagged flow paths to support design, automation, and documentation in a non-graphical format.  

*(Focused on structured textual representation of process flow and control logic for engineering use cases.)*

### Prompt:
**P-ID Steam Water Cycle:**

Create a P&I diagram in textual notation for a steam water cycle in a power plant. Include equipment, instrumentation, piping, and control loops. Provide concrete tag names.


**R-I-S-E:**

ðŸŸ¥ R (Role) â€“ Define Your Role

Act as a process control engineer responsible for documenting the steam-water cycle of a power plant using text-based P&ID notation for use in early design, instrumentation planning, or control logic development.

â¸»

ðŸŸ© I (Input) â€“ Information Provided

You are to create a textual Piping and Instrumentation Diagram (P&ID) that covers the full steam-water cycle, including:
	â€¢	Major equipment (e.g., boiler, steam drum, feedwater pump, condenser)
	â€¢	Associated instrumentation (e.g., transmitters, controllers, control valves)
	â€¢	Piping flow direction using arrows (-->)
	â€¢	Concrete tag names for all components (e.g., FT101, LT102, FCV103)

The output should mirror the clarity of a traditional P&ID but in structured text form, supporting use cases where graphics are unavailable or impractical.

ðŸŸ§ S (Steps) â€“ Steps to Perform
	1.	List key components of the steam-water cycle in operational order:
	â€¢	Feedwater Pump â†’ Boiler â†’ Steam Drum â†’ Turbine â†’ Condenser â†’ Back to Feed
	2.	For each equipment item, identify the associated instrumentation and control loops, e.g.:
	â€¢	FT101 (Flow Transmitter), FIC101 (Flow Controller), FCV101 (Flow Control Valve)
	3.	Connect elements using text-based flow notation, e.g.:

 P01 --> FT101 --> FIC101 --> FCV101 --> B01

 4.	Ensure each control loop includes a transmitter, controller, and actuator, and assign clear tag numbers.
	5.	Organize the diagram in logical blocks (e.g., Feedwater System, Boiler Section, Condensate Return) for readability.

â¸»

ðŸŸ¦ E (Expectation) â€“ Expected Outcome

Deliver a text-based P&ID that provides a complete, readable map of the steam-water cycle, including all control logic and signal pathways. It should:
	â€¢	Support cross-functional collaboration (engineering, automation, commissioning)
	â€¢	Serve as input for PLC/DCS programming
	â€¢	Ensure traceability through clearly labeled tags and flow paths
	â€¢	Be portable and editable in plain-text tools and version control systems
