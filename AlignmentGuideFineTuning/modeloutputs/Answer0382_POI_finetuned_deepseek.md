ðŸŸ¥ C (Context) â€“ Background Situation

In ammonium nitrate production, the reactor is a critical unit where ammonia and nitric acid react under controlled temperature and pressure conditions. A well-defined control narrative is essential for ensuring safety, optimizing yield, and maintaining regulatory compliance. Without clear setpoints, instrumentation, and sequence logic, the process may suffer from inefficiencies or become hazardous.

	â€¢	Emergency shutoff valves with interlocks tied to high temperature (>185â€¯Â°C), overpressure (>5.2â€¯bar), or low pH (<5.5)

Operational Sequence Overview:
	1.	Initialize system; confirm all valves in closed and tank levels in range
	2.	Begin controlled ammonia and nitric acid flow
	3.	Ramp up reactor temperature using steam jacket
	4.	Adjust ammonia-to-acid ratio to maintain pH
	5.	Monitor steady-state; activate alarms/interlocks on deviation
	6.	Shutdown by closing feeds and venting pressure safely

# Control Narrative for Ammonium Nitrate Reactor

## Overview

The ammonium nitrate reactor is a critical unit in the production process, where ammonia and nitric acid react under controlled temperature and pressure conditions. The reactor must be operated safely and efficiently to ensure high-quality ammonium nitrate production. This control narrative outlines the setpoints, instrumentation, operational sequences, and interlocks required for safe and efficient operation.

## Setpoints and Ranges

### Reactor Temperature

Setpoint: 175Â°C Â± 2Â°C

### Reactor Pressure

Setpoint: 4.8 bar Â± 0.2 bar

### Ammonia to Nitric Acid Flow Ratio

Setpoint: 1.01:1

### pH Range

Setpoint: 6.2 Â± 0.3

## Instrumentation and Equipment

### Flow Meters

- Flow transmitter on acid line

### Emergency Shutoff Valves

- High-temperature shutoff valve
- High-pressure shutoff valve
- Low-pH shutoff valve

### Interlocks

- High-temperature interlock: shuts down reactor if temperature exceeds 185Â°C
- High-pressure interlock: shuts down acid valve and opens vent if pressure exceeds 5.2 bar
- Low-pH interlock: shuts down acid flow and opens vent if pH falls below 5.5

## Operational Sequence

1. **Startup:**

- Verify all valves are closed and tank levels are within range
- Initiate controlled ammonia and nitric acid flow
- Ramp up reactor temperature using steam jacket
- Adjust ammonia-to-acid ratio to maintain pH
- Monitor steady-state operation

2. **Steady-State Operation:**

- Maintain temperature and pressure within setpoints
- Monitor pH and flow rates continuously
- Activ
