### Intent:
The task is to develop an ISA-88-compliant Structured Text program for controlling the reaction stage of urea fertilizer production, including heating, cooling, and pressure regulation with precise phase transitions and parameter monitoring.

### Prompt:
**Batch Urea Fertilizer:**

Create an ISA-88 batch control recipe for the production of urea fertilizer, detailing the key stages of the process. Write a self-contained IEC 61131-3 Structured Text program to manage the sequential control of the reaction stage, using typical parameter values for temperature, pressure, and timing. Focus on providing the control logic for heating, cooling, and pressure regulation within the reactor, ensuring that the transitions between each operation are based on concrete conditions and timers.

Incorporate specific code snippets to manage the heating and cooling phases, as well as regulating the pressure, while explaining the use of structured text for modular control in industrial processes. Additionally, discuss the challenges of optimizing these control sequences for efficient production and compliance with ISA-88 standards.

**ISA-88 Compliance:**

ISA-88 is a set of standards for the development of batch control recipes in the chemical and food industries. It provides guidelines for the creation of structured text programs that can be easily understood and maintained by operators and engineers.

The ISA-88 standard emphasizes the importance of modularity and readability in control logic, which can be achieved by breaking down complex processes into smaller, more manageable functions. This allows for easier troubleshooting, system upgrades, and process optimization.

In the context of this task, the ISA-88 compliance is achieved by creating a structured text program that follows the guidelines provided by the standard. This includes using clear and concise code, modular functions, and well-defined transitions between operations.

**ISA-88 Batch Control Recipe:**

```
FUNCTION StartHeating
	WAIT 10 MINUTES
	IF Temperature < 180Â°C THEN
		HEAT_ON
		WAIT 10 MINUTES
		IF Temperature >= 180Â°C THEN
			HEAT_OFF
		ENDIF
	ENDIF
ENDFUNCTION

FUNCTION RegulatePressure
	WAIT 10 MINUTES
	IF Pressure > 140 BAR THEN
		COOL_ON
		WAIT 10 MINUTES
		IF Pressure <= 140 BAR THEN
			COOL_OFF
		ENDIF
	ENDIF
ENDFUNCTION

FUNCTION StartCooling
	WAIT 10 MINUTES
	IF Temperature > 120Â°C THEN
		COOL_ON
		WAIT 10 MINUTES
		IF Temperature <= 120Â°C THEN
			COOL_OFF
		ENDIF
	ENDIF
ENDFUNCTION
```

**ISA-88 Challenges:**

1. **Real-time synchronization:** Ensuring that all control functions are executed in real-time, without any delays or synchronization issues.
2. **Resource management:** Efficiently managing system resources, such as CPU, memory, and I/O, to ensure smooth operation and minimize bottlenecks.
3. **Maintainability:** Maintaining the control logic over time, as changes in the process or equipment may require updates to the control program.
4. **Scalability:** Ensuring that the control program can be easily expanded
