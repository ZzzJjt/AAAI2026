### Intent:
**Intent Summary:**  
Create an IEC 61131-3 Structured Text function block to compute the mean and sample standard deviation of a fixed-size integer array (100 elements) for real-time industrial applications, ensuring precision, overflow handling, and deterministic performance with inline documentation.  

*(Focus: Statistical calculation, PLC constraints, modularity, and real-time suitability.)*

### Prompt:
**Mean and StdDev:**

Create a self-contained function block in IEC 61131-3 Structured Text to compute both the mean and standard deviation of an input array consisting of 100 integers. Ensure that the function block is modular and includes detailed comments explaining the steps of calculating both statistical measures. Address potential issues related to overflow or precision when handling large datasets, and provide insights into the function blockâ€™s applicability within real-time control systems.

ðŸŸ© T (Task) â€“ What You Need to Do

Develop a function block named MeanStdDevCalculator that:
	â€¢	Accepts an input array:
InputArray : ARRAY[1..100] OF INT
	â€¢	Computes two statistical outputs:
	â€¢	Mean : REAL â€“ the average of the 100 values
	â€¢	StdDev : REAL â€“ the sample standard deviation
	â€¢	Follows this logic:
	1.	Mean:
	â€¢	Sum all elements using a REAL accumulator
	â€¢	Divide by 100.0
	2.	Standard deviation:
	â€¢	For each value, subtract the mean and square the result
	â€¢	Sum these squared differences
	â€¢	Divide by 99.0 and apply SQRT
	â€¢	Includes inline comments to explain:
	â€¢	The use of REAL for accuracy and to prevent overflow
	â€¢	Why the divisor is Nâˆ’1 for sample standard deviation
	â€¢	How the design ensures deterministic scan-time performance
	â€¢	Addresses limitations such as:
	â€¢	Precision loss with large integers
	â€¢	Potential scan-time impact if extended to larger arrays
	â€¢	Inflexibility if array size must change (optionally parameterize in future)

ðŸŸ§ F (Format) â€“ Expected Output

Your final function block should include:
	â€¢	Structured Text code like:
 Sum := 0.0;
FOR i := 1 TO 100 DO
    Sum := Sum + InputArray[i];
END_FOR;
Mean := Sum / 100.0;

SumSquaredDiff := 0.0;
FOR i := 1 TO 100 DO
    Diff := InputArray[i] - Mean;
    SumSquaredDiff := SumSquaredDiff + (Diff * Diff);
END_FOR;
StdDev := SQRT(SumSquaredDiff / 99.0);

	â€¢	Inline documentation that clearly describes the purpose of each section
	â€¢	A structure that supports reuse in:
	â€¢	Sensor signal conditioning
	â€¢	Real-time quality assurance
	â€¢	Anomaly detection in control loops

ðŸŸ© A (Action) â€“ Your Plan of Action

To create the MeanStdDevCalculator function block, follow these steps:

1.	Define the input array and the output variables for mean and standard deviation.
2.	Implement a loop to sum all the elements in the input array, using a REAL accumulator to ensure precision.
3.	Compute the mean by dividing the sum by 100.0.
4.	Implement another loop to calculate the squared difference between each element and the mean, summing these squared differences.
5.	Compute the standard deviation by dividing the sum of squared differences by 99.0 and taking the square root.
6.	Include inline comments to explain the logic behind each step, including the use of REAL for precision and the divisor of Nâˆ’1 for sample standard deviation.
7.	Address potential issues related to precision loss with large integers and the impact on scan time when handling larger arrays.
8.	Consider the limitations of the current implementation and discuss how it could be extended to support dynamic array sizes in future versions.
