### Intent:
**Intent Summary:**  
Develop a self-contained IEC 61131-3 Structured Text program for feedforward control in a chemical mixing process, dynamically adjusting Reactant A's flow based on Reactant B's flow and optional factors (e.g., concentration, temperature) to maintain a desired ratio, improving response time and reducing variability compared to feedback-only systems.  

**Key Focus:**  
- Real-time flow adjustment via feedforward logic (no function blocks).  
- Modular calculation of `Flow_A_Setpoint` using `Desired_Ratio` and `Compensation_Factor`.  
- Immediate disturbance rejection for process stability.  

*(Note: The provided "After" example is a PID pressure control program, which is unrelated to the feedforward mixing task described in the "Before" section.)*

### Prompt:
**Feedforward Control Mixing:**

Develop a self-contained IEC 61131-3 Structured Text program (not a function block) to implement feedforward control for mixing two reactants in a chemical process. The program should predict the necessary adjustments to the flow rates of each reactant based on known disturbances or input changes, ensuring optimal mixing conditions.

Include logic that calculates the required feedforward adjustments based on process variables such as flow rates, concentration, and temperature, and ensure the control system can respond quickly to input changes without relying solely on feedback. Discuss the advantages of using feedforward control in mixing processes, particularly in terms of improving response time and reducing process variability compared to traditional feedback control.

**R-T-F:**

ðŸŸ¥ R (Role) â€“ Your Role

You are a PLC control engineer developing a program in IEC 61131-3 Structured Text to implement feedforward control for a chemical mixing system. Your goal is to adjust the flow of Reactant A in real time based on known variations in Reactant Bâ€™s flow or characteristics.

â¸»

ðŸŸ© T (Task) â€“ What You Need to Do

Create a self-contained Structured Text program (not a function block) that:
	1.	Reads process variables, including the flow rate of Reactant B (Flow_B) and optional factors like concentration or temperature.
	2.	Calculates a setpoint for Reactant Aâ€™s flow using a defined ratio (Desired_Ratio) and a Compensation_Factor that may account for dynamic conditions.
	3.	Implements feedforward logic that allows the system to respond immediately to changesâ€”without waiting for feedback from output quality.
	4.	Outputs the setpoint (Flow_A_Setpoint) for use in adjusting pumps or valves in the mixing system.

ðŸŸ§ F (Format) â€“ Expected Output

Your final output should be a clean, readable Structured Text code block like the following:
VAR
    // Inputs
    Desired_Ratio : REAL := 2.0;           // Target A:B ratio
    Flow_B : REAL;                         // Measured flow of Reactant B
    Concentration_B : REAL := 0.8;         // Optional
    Temperature_B : REAL := 25.0;          // Optional

    // Compensation and output
    Compensation_Factor : REAL := 1.0;     // Can be adjusted based on optional variables
    Flow_A_Setpoint : REAL;
END_VAR

// Feedforward calculation for Reactant A
Flow_A_Setpoint := Desired_Ratio * Flow_B * Compensation_Factor;

// Optional: dynamic compensation logic
// Compensation_Factor := f(Concentration_B, Temperature_B);

This format ensures:
	â€¢	Immediate adjustments to maintain the desired mixing ratio
	â€¢	Increased process stability with reduced variability
	â€¢	A program that is modular, maintainable, and PLC-ready
