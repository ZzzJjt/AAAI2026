### Intent:
**Intent Summary:**  
Develop an IEC 61131-3 Structured Text PID controller to regulate a turbine's inlet valve position, maintaining a temperature setpoint (950Â°C) using predefined gains (Kp=3.0, Ki=0.7, Kd=0.2) with 100ms updates, while clamping the output to safe limits (0-100%).

### Prompt:
**PID Pressure Control Chemical Reactor:**

Develop a self-contained IEC 61131-3 Structured Text program to implement PID feedback control for regulating the pressure in a chemical reactor. The program should continuously adjust the opening of a pressure control valve based on a setpoint to maintain optimal pressure levels within the reactor.

Include the PID control loop parameters (proportional, integral, and derivative gains) and ensure the logic accounts for pressure deviations from the setpoint. The program should also include safeguards to prevent over-pressurization or under-pressurization by limiting the valveâ€™s operational range. Discuss the critical role of pressure control in chemical reactors, emphasizing safety, process efficiency, and system stability under dynamic reaction conditions.
