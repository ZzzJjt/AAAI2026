‚úÖ Example:

‚ÄúIEC 61499 is a modern, event-driven programming language designed for distributed control systems. It differs from IEC 61131-3 in several ways:

‚Ä¢	Execution: 61499 is event-driven, while 61131-3 is scan-based.
‚Ä¢	Architecture: 61499 is inherently distributed, while 61131-3 is typically centralized.
‚Ä¢	Flexibility: 61499 allows for reusable function blocks and platform independence.
