**Steps to Implement MPC for HVAC System Optimization:**

1. Define the HVAC system model:
   - Thermal dynamics
   - Humidity dynamics
   - External conditions (temperature, humidity, solar radiation)
   - Occupancy levels
   - Energy efficiency requirements

2. Develop the MPC algorithm:
   - Define the cost function (objective function)
   - Formulate the constraints (temperature, humidity, energy efficiency)
   - Implement the optimization solver (e.g., QP solver)
   - Calculate the control actions for the prediction horizon

3. Simulate the HVAC system:
   - Initialize the system state
   - Run the MPC algorithm at each time step
   - Update the system state and output the results

4. Evaluate the performance of the MPC algorithm:
   - Compare the MPC-controlled system with a traditional control method (e.g., PID)
   - Analyze the energy consumption, response time, and system performance under various scenarios
   - Visualize the results to demonstrate the benefits of MPC
