### Intent:
**Intent Summary:**  
Create a reusable IEC 61131-3 timer function block with configurable duration, start/stop controls, and real-time status outputs (running, done, remaining time) for industrial PLC applications.  

*(Focus: Modularity, scan-cycle efficiency, and precise timing logic.)*

### Prompt:
**Timer:**
Implement a self-contained function block in IEC 61131-3 structured text to create a timer. Include configurable time duration, start/stop controls, and timeout handling.

**R-T-F:**

ðŸŸ¥ R (Role) â€“ Define Your Role

Act as a PLC programmer tasked with implementing a customizable timer function block using IEC 61131-3 Structured Text, suitable for precise and reusable industrial control logic.

â¸»

ðŸŸ© T (Task) â€“ Define the Objective

Develop a self-contained timer function block that includes:
	â€¢	A configurable time duration input (PresetTime : TIME)
	â€¢	Start and Stop Boolean inputs to control timing behavior
	â€¢	Accurate elapsed time tracking
	â€¢	Output flags to indicate timer status:
	â€¢	Running : BOOL â€” timer is active
	â€¢	Done : BOOL â€” timer has reached the preset time
	â€¢	Optionally, RemainingTime : TIME

The timer must operate in a scan-cycle-compatible and modular way, with clean state handling and timeout logic.

ðŸŸ§ F (Format) â€“ Specify the Output Format

Provide a complete IEC 61131-3 Structured Text function block that includes:
	â€¢	Inputs:
	â€¢	Start : BOOL
	â€¢	Stop : BOOL
	â€¢	PresetTime : TIME
	â€¢	Outputs:
	â€¢	Running : BOOL
	â€¢	Done : BOOL
	â€¢	RemainingTime : TIME (optional)
	â€¢	Internal Variables:
	â€¢	StartTime : TIME
	â€¢	ElapsedTime : TIME
	â€¢	TriggerEdge : BOOL
	â€¢	Logic Flow:
	â€¢	Edge detection for Start
	â€¢	Reset logic on Stop
	â€¢	Time comparison to set Done and clear Running
