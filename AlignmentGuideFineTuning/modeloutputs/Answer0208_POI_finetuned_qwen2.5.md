### Intent:
**Intent Summary:**  
Develop MATLAB code to implement a Model Predictive Control (MPC) scheme for optimizing a distillation column's dynamic behavior, handling nonlinear feed-rate-to-temperature relationships and system constraints.  

*(Focus: Dynamic modeling + constrained MPC for distillation process optimization.)*

### Prompt:
**Model Predictive Control for Turbine Optimization in a Thermal Power Plant Using Python:**

Develop Python code to implement a model predictive control (MPC) algorithm for optimizing the operation of a turbine in a thermal power plant. The MPC should account for operational constraints, energy efficiency, and thermal dynamics, while ensuring robust performance under varying load conditions and external disturbances.

**C-A-R-E:**

ðŸŸ¥ Cï¼ˆContextï¼‰

In thermal power plants, turbines must operate efficiently under dynamic load conditions while managing complex thermal dynamics and adhering to operational constraints. Traditional control systems often fall short in handling rapid changes and ensuring both stability and energy efficiency.

ðŸŸ© Aï¼ˆActionï¼‰

Develop Python code to implement a model predictive control (MPC) algorithm that models turbine dynamics and optimizes control actions in real time. The MPC should consider system constraints, external disturbances, and changing load demands to maintain stable and efficient turbine operation.

ðŸŸ¨ Rï¼ˆResultï¼‰

The MPC system should enhance turbine responsiveness, reduce energy waste, and improve robustness against disturbancesâ€”achieving greater control precision than conventional methods.

ðŸŸ¦ Eï¼ˆExampleï¼‰

For example, simulate a scenario where the load demand increases sharply. Show how the MPC controller anticipates the required adjustments, maintains system stability, and optimizes fuel use, while a traditional controller might overshoot or lag behind.
