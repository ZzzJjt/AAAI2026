### Intent:
**Intent Summary:**  
Create a Structured Text function block implementing the Simplex method for linear programming in PLCs, with inputs for constraints/objective functions, outputs for solutions, and documentation on industrial applicability and limitations.  

*(Focus: On-device optimization for real-time control tasks like resource allocation or batch blending.)*

### Prompt:
**Linear Programming:**

Develop a self-contained function block in IEC 61131-3 Structured Text to solve a linear programming problem using the simplex method. Ensure the function block is designed to handle multiple constraints and objective functions, with detailed comments explaining the algorithm and each computational step. Discuss the limitations of implementing linear programming in a PLC environment, particularly with respect to memory and processing power, and provide examples of how this function block could be applied in industrial optimization scenarios.

**Example Scenario:**

A chemical plant wants to optimize the production of three different products (A, B, C) using a limited set of raw materials (X, Y, Z). The objective is to maximize the profit, with the following constraints:

1.	Total raw material usage must not exceed the available stock (X_total, Y_total, Z_total)
2.	The production of each product must meet the minimum demand (A_min, B_min, C_min)
3.	The production of each product cannot exceed the maximum capacity (A_max, B_max, C_max)

The SimplexSolver function block can be used to determine the optimal production quantities for each product to maximize profit, given the cost and selling price of each product and the raw material usage coefficients.
