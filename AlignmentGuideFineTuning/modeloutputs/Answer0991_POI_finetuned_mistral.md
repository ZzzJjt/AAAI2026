### Intent:
**Intent Summary:**  
Create an automation-ready control narrative for an LNG vaporizer system (100,000 kg/h capacity) with detailed process flows, instrumentation tags (NORSOK I-005), PID control loops, and safety interlocks to ensure safe, efficient vaporization of LNG to natural gas at specified setpoints (e.g., 10Â°C outlet, 4.5 bar pressure).  

*(Focus: Code generation for industrial control logic, instrumentation mapping, and interlock implementation.)*

### Prompt:
**Control Narrative Beer Brewing:**

**T-A-G:**

ðŸŸ¥ T (Task)

Create a control narrative for an automated beer brewing process, with emphasis on specifying concrete setpoints and detailing the lautering phase (Section 4).

â¸»

ðŸŸ© A (Action)
	â€¢	Define the brewing process stages, including specific setpoints and control ranges for parameters like temperature, flow rate, and volume.
	â€¢	In Section 4 â€“ Lautering, include:
	â€¢	A list of required equipment: lauter tun, rake motor, sparge system, wort pump
	â€¢	A list of required instrumentation: turbidity meter, flow transmitter, level sensor, temperature probe
	â€¢	A step-by-step procedure for the lautering process, such as:
	1.	Start recirculation of wort
	2.	Monitor turbidity; wait until it drops below 200 NTU
	3.	Begin transferring wort to the kettle
	4.	Add sparge water at 76â€¯Â°C to maintain lauter tun level between 60â€“80%
	5.	Stop process based on turbidity or volume criteria
	â€¢	Include interlock logic, such as:
	â€¢	IF Turbidity > Limit THEN open waste valve
	â€¢	IF Level < Minimum THEN stop sparging

### Control Narrative for LNG Vaporizer System

#### 1. Introduction
This control narrative describes the operation of an LNG vaporizer system designed to convert liquid natural gas (LNG) into natural gas at a rate of 100,000 kg/h. The system ensures safe and efficient vaporization while maintaining precise control over key process parameters. The narrative includes detailed descriptions of the process flow, instrumentation, control loops, and interlocks to support safe and reliable operation.

#### 2. Process Overview
The LNG vaporizer system consists of the following major components:
- LNG Inlet: Receives LNG from storage tanks at a pressure of 1.2 bar (gauge).
- Vaporizer: A shell-and-tube heat exchanger that heats LNG to convert it into natural gas.
- Gas Outlet: Delivers the vaporized gas to the downstream gas distribution system at a pressure of 4.5 bar (gauge).
- Sparge Water Inlet: Provides water for cooling the vaporizer.
- Condensate Drain: Removes any liquid condensate from the system.

#### 3. Instrumentation and Control Loops
The following instrumentation and control loops are used to ensure safe and efficient operation:

##### 3.1 Temperature Control Loop
- **Setpoint**: 10Â°C (monitored at the outlet of the vaporizer).
- **Control Element**: Water flow rate to the vaporizer.
- **Actuator**: Flow control valve on the sparge water supply.
- **Controller**: PID controller (e.g., PLC-based).

##### 3.2 Pressure Control Loop
- **Setpoint**: 4.5 bar (gauge) at the gas outlet.
- **Control Element**: Flow control valve at the gas outlet.
- **Actuator**: Flow control valve position.
- **Controller**: PID controller (e.g., PLC-based).

##### 3.3 Level Control Loop
- **Setpoint**: 60â€“80% (monitored in the vaporizer).
- **Control Element**: Water flow rate to the vaporizer.
