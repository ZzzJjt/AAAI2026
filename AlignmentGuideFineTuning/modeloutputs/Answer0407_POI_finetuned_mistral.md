### Intent:
The task involves developing a **Model Predictive Control (MPC) system in Python to optimize robot movement** by dynamically planning trajectories, avoiding obstacles, and adhering to motion constraints in real-time.  

*(Intent: Generate Python code for MPC-based robotic motion planning with dynamic obstacle avoidance.)*

### Prompt:
**Model Predictive Control for Optimizing Robot Movement Using Python:**

Develop Python code to implement a model predictive control (MPC) algorithm for optimizing the movement of a robot. The control system should consider dynamic constraints, path planning, and obstacle avoidance while ensuring smooth, efficient, and adaptive movement in a dynamic environment.

**R-I-S-E:**

ðŸŸ¥ Rï¼ˆRoleï¼‰

Act as a robotics engineer specializing in motion planning and predictive control using Python.

ðŸŸ© Iï¼ˆInputï¼‰

You are tasked with developing a motion control system for a mobile robot navigating in a dynamic environment. The robot must move efficiently while avoiding obstacles and adhering to dynamic constraints such as speed limits, turning radius, and changing surroundings.

ðŸŸ§ Sï¼ˆStepsï¼‰
	1.	Model the robotâ€™s motion dynamics in Python, including constraints on acceleration, velocity, and orientation.
	2.	Implement a model predictive control (MPC) algorithm that plans the robotâ€™s trajectory over a prediction horizon.
	3.	Integrate obstacle detection and avoidance mechanisms within the MPC framework.
	4.	Simulate various dynamic scenarios (e.g., moving obstacles, changing goal points) to test the robotâ€™s adaptability and efficiency.

ðŸŸ¦ Eï¼ˆExpectationï¼‰

The robot should be able to navigate smoothly and efficiently, adapt to environmental changes in real time, and avoid obstaclesâ€”demonstrating the advantages of MPC over traditional control approaches in dynamic motion planning tasks.
