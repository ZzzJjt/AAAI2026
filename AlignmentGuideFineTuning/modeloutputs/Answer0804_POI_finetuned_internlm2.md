Flight dynamics: The aircraftâ€™s motion can be described by a set of nonlinear differential equations, including equations for acceleration, velocity, and position. These equations account for aerodynamic forces, gravity, and control inputs.

Constraints: The MPC system must ensure that control inputs remain within safe limits, such as maximum thrust and pitch angles. Additionally, the system must account for constraints on fuel consumption, ensuring that the aircraft operates efficiently while maintaining performance objectives.

Disturbances: External disturbances, such as wind gusts, can impact the aircraftâ€™s trajectory. The MPC system must be robust to these disturbances, adjusting control inputs to maintain optimal flight paths.

Objectives: The primary objective is to optimize the aircraftâ€™s trajectory while minimizing fuel consumption. Secondary objectives include maintaining safe flight conditions and ensuring that the aircraft follows a predefined flight plan.
