### Intent:
**Intent Summary:**  
Develop an IEC 61131-3 Structured Text program for cascade control of a heat exchanger, where an outer temperature loop sets a flow setpoint for an inner flow control loop to improve dynamic response and stability under load variations.  

*(Key focus: Cascade control, temperature/flow loops, real-time disturbance rejection, industrial PLC deployment.)*

### Prompt:
**Cascade Control Heat Exchanger:**

Develop a self-contained IEC 61131-3 Structured Text program (not a function block) to implement cascade control for regulating the temperature in a heat exchanger. The outer loop should control the temperature setpoint based on the process requirements, while the inner loop controls the flow rate of the heating medium to adjust the temperature dynamically.

The program should manage the interaction between the primary and secondary control loops, ensuring that the inner loop responds quickly to disturbances, while the outer loop provides overall temperature stability. Include typical parameter values for temperature control and flow adjustments, and discuss the advantages of using cascade control in heat exchanger systems, particularly in improving response times and maintaining stable temperature control under varying load conditions.

**T-A-G:**

ðŸŸ¥ T (Task) â€“ What You Need to Do

Write a self-contained IEC 61131-3 Structured Text program (not a function block) to implement cascade control for regulating the temperature in a heat exchanger system. Your solution must include both an outer temperature control loop and an inner flow control loop.

â¸»

ðŸŸ© A (Action) â€“ How to Do It
	1.	Configure the Outer Loop (Temperature Control):
	â€¢	Use a temperature setpoint (Temp_SP := 85.0) and a measured process variable (Temp_PV)
	â€¢	Calculate the temperature error and convert it to a flow setpoint (Flow_SP) using a proportional gain (Kp_Outer)
	2.	Configure the Inner Loop (Flow Control):
	â€¢	Compare the flow setpoint (Flow_SP) to the actual flow reading (Flow_PV)
	â€¢	Calculate the flow error and generate a valve control signal (Flow_Output) using another proportional gain (Kp_Inner)
	3.	Implement Real-Time Behavior:
	â€¢	Run both loops cyclically, ensuring that the inner loop is responsive to fast disturbances
	â€¢	Use clear structure and comments for maintainability and tuning

â¸»

ðŸŸ¦ G (Goal) â€“ What You Want to Achieve

The program should:
	â€¢	Provide stable and responsive temperature regulation under varying load conditions
	â€¢	Improve disturbance rejection by letting the inner loop react quickly to changes
	â€¢	Offer a readable and modular control structure, ready for deployment in industrial PLC environments
	â€¢	Serve as a foundation for future enhancements like full PID control or safety interlocks

VAR
    // Outer temperature loop
    Temp_SP : REAL := 85.0;      // Desired temperature
    Temp_PV : REAL;              // Measured temperature
    Temp_Error : REAL;
    Flow_SP : REAL;

    // Inner flow loop
    Flow_PV : REAL;              // Measured flow
    Flow_Error : REAL;
    Flow_Output : REAL;

    // Gains
    Kp_Outer : REAL := 1.0;
    Kp_Inner : REAL := 2.0;
END_VAR

// Outer loop: calculate flow setpoint from temperature control
Temp_Error := Temp_SP - Temp_PV;
Flow_SP := Kp_Outer * Temp_Error;

// Inner loop: control flow to match flow setpoint
Flow_Error := Flow_SP - Flow_PV;
Flow_Output := Kp_Inner * Flow_Error;

// Flow_Output controls valve actuator

(* Notes:

   - Cascade control combines two control loops: outer temperature loop and inner flow loop.
   - Outer loop calculates flow setpoint based on temperature error.
   - Inner loop adjusts flow to match flow setpoint.
   - Outer loop is faster and more responsive to temperature changes, while inner loop is faster to flow changes.
   - Outer loop uses a gain of 1.0:1000, and inner loop uses a gain of 2.0:1000.
