### Intent:
The task is to develop an ISA-88-compliant batch control program in Structured Text for PVC production, implementing sequential stages (polymerize, decover, dry) with precise parameter control and safety interlocks.

### Prompt:
**Batch PVC:**

Develop a self-contained program in IEC 61131-3 Structured Text for the sequential control of a reactor in the batch production of polyvinylchloride (PVC) via polymerization of vinyl chloride monomers. The program should follow an ISA-88 control recipe structure and include the following process stages: polymerize, decover, and dry. Each stage should consist of ordered operations, including preparing the reactor by evacuating it to remove oxygen, charging the reactor with demineralized water and surfactants, and reacting by adding vinyl chloride monomer and catalyst while controlling the temperature between 55-60Â°C until the pressure decreases.

Provide detailed content for key methods such as EvacuateReactor, which should handle the removal of oxygen, and AddDemineralizedWater, ensuring precise process parameters and timers are integrated. Additionally, discuss the application of ISA-88 principles in structuring the control recipe and the challenges involved in scaling the recipe for industrial use.

**C-A-R-E:**

ðŸŸ¥ C (Context) â€“ Background Situation

The batch production of polyvinylchloride (PVC) through the polymerization of vinyl chloride monomers (VCM) involves multiple critical stages including reactor evacuation, charging with demineralized water and surfactants, controlled reaction, and drying. Precise control of temperature, pressure, and timing is essential. To ensure modularity, maintainability, and scalability, the process must follow ISA-88 batch control principles, especially when implemented in IEC 61131-3 Structured Text.

ðŸŸ© A (Action) â€“ Task to Perform

Develop a self-contained Structured Text program that controls the batch PVC process using an ISA-88-compliant recipe structure. The program should include the following stages:
	â€¢	Polymerize: Evacuate the reactor, add water, surfactants, and VCM, then control the temperature between 55â€“60Â°C until the pressure drops.
	â€¢	Decover: Prepare for opening or depressurization.
	â€¢	Dry: Execute material separation and drying phase.

Create detailed logic for methods such as EvacuateReactor (to remove oxygen) and AddDemineralizedWater, using timers, process setpoints, and interlocks to ensure safe and efficient operation. Structure the code with clear phase-based logic and transition conditions.

ðŸŸ¨ R (Result) â€“ Expected Outcome

The result should be a modular, reusable control program that provides safe, consistent, and scalable execution of the PVC batch process. The use of ISA-88 principles should enhance the clarity of the control strategy, simplify validation and testing, and enable efficient scale-up to industrial production environments.

ðŸŸ¦ E (Example) â€“ Concrete Illustration

For example, the EvacuateReactor method should monitor vacuum pressure until it drops below a specified setpoint (e.g., 200 mbar) within a defined timeout. Once complete, AddDemineralizedWater(Volume := 300L) is triggered, and the system transitions to StartPolymerization, maintaining the temperature between 55â€“60Â°C for up to 4 hours or until internal pressure drops below 1.5 bar.

### Generated Code:
