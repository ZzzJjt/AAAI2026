### Intent:
**Intent Summary:**  
Develop an ISA-88-compliant Structured Text program to automate the "Reaction" step in adhesive batch production, including temperature control, mixing, and timed phase transitions while adhering to modular design principles.

### Prompt:
**Batch Adhesive:**

Develop an ISA-88 batch control recipe for the production of adhesive, detailing the stages involved in the process. Create a self-contained program in IEC 61131-3 Structured Text to manage the sequential control of step B.2, Reaction, with specific process parameters and timers. Include the necessary control logic to call methods corresponding to each phase of the reaction, ensuring that transitions between steps are managed through appropriate conditions and timer values.

Incorporate detailed content for calling the methods that govern specific operations, such as heating, mixing, and maintaining the reaction environment. Additionally, discuss the integration of ISA-88 standards in batch process control, focusing on how the structured text program facilitates modularity and flexibility in controlling the adhesive production process.

```

**Discussion:**

The provided Structured Text program adheres to the principles of ISA-88 procedural control. It is modular, with separate methods for heating, mixing, and maintaining the reaction environment. This modularity allows for easy reusability and modification of individual operations without affecting the overall program.

The program uses clear variable and timer definitions, making it easy to understand and maintain. The use of comments within the code provides a clear explanation of the control logic and transitions between phases
