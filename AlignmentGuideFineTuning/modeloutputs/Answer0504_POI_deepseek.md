🟥 R (Role) – Your Role

You are a PLC programmer or control systems engineer tasked with implementing an on-device linear programming solver using the Simplex method, optimized for real-time industrial environments through IEC 61131-3 Structured Text.

⸻

🟩 I (Input) – What You’re Given

You are required to build a function block called SimplexSolver that:
	•	Solves linear programming problems using the Simplex algorithm
	•	Accepts:
	•	An array for the objective function coefficients (e.g., C: ARRAY[1..N] OF REAL)
	•	A constraint matrix (e.g., A: ARRAY[1..M,1..N] OF REAL)
	•	A right-hand side array (B: ARRAY[1..M] OF REAL)
	•	Produces:
	•	An optimal solution vector (X: ARRAY[1..N] OF REAL)
	•	The optimal objective function value
	•	A status flag (e.g., solution found, infeasible, max iterations reached)
	•	Operates under PLC constraints, including fixed memory, bounded loop execution, and limited floating-point precision

⸻

🟧 S (Steps) – What You Need to Do
	1.	Define the function block interface with arrays sized for typical industrial applications (e.g., max 5 variables, 5 constraints).
	2.	Implement the core Simplex method:
	•	Initialize the Simplex tableau
	•	Identify the pivot column and row
	•	Perform row operations to update the tableau
	•	Repeat until optimality or iteration limit is reached
	3.	Add inline comments to explain:
	•	Mathematical steps (e.g., pivot logic, ratio tests)
	•	Performance considerations (e.g., avoid recursion, use FOR loops)
	•	Error-handling (e.g., division by zero, unbounded solutions)
	4.	Integrate safety and performance limits, including:
	•	Max iteration count
	•	Output flag for infeasibility
	•	Optional watchdog trigger or time-slicing logic

⸻

🟦 E (Expectation) – What Success Looks Like

You produce a modular, reusable function block that allows a PLC to perform basic linear optimization autonomously. The block:
	•	Handles small LP problems in real time
	•	Is documented and structured for clarity and maintainability
	•	Enables optimization tasks such as:
	•	Resource allocation
	•	Load distribution
	•	Blending/mixing ratios
	•	Provides deterministic outputs, supporting control system decision-making without relying on external solvers or cloud connectivity

Strengths:
	•	On-device linear programming solver for real-time optimization
	•	Optimized for constrained PLC environments
	•	Modular and reusable, enabling industrial applications
	•	Decouples control systems from external cloud connectivity

Weaknesses:

	•	Memory and processing constraints may limit performance
	•	Requires careful error handling and optimization to avoid excessive CPU usage
	•	May not be suitable for complex, large-scale optimization problems

🟩 E (Example) – How It Can Be Applied

Consider a small-scale industrial application, such as a blending system for a chemical plant. The system requires optimal blending ratios to minimize waste and maximize efficiency. The SimplexSolver function block can be used to:
	1.	Define the objective function (minimize waste)
	2.	Define the constraint matrix (e.g., weight limits for each ingredient)
	3.	Run the SimplexSolver function block to obtain optimal blending ratios
	4.	Apply the optimal ratios to the blending process

By implementing a self-contained linear programming solver in a PLC, you can enable real-time optimization tasks in constrained industrial environments.
