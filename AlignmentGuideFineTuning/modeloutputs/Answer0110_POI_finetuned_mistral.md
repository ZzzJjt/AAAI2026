### Intent:
"Implement a cascade control system for a heat exchanger using Structured Text, where an outer temperature control loop sets the flow setpoint for an inner flow control loop to maintain stable outlet temperature while efficiently managing heating medium flow."

### Prompt:
**Ratio Control Mixing:**

Develop a self-contained IEC 61131-3 Structured Text program (not a function block) to implement ratio control for mixing two reactants in a 2:1 ratio. The program should maintain the desired ratio between the two reactants by adjusting their flow rates dynamically, ensuring that for every two parts of reactant A, one part of reactant B is added.

Include logic to monitor the flow rates of both reactants and adjust one flow rate relative to the other to maintain the 2:1 ratio. The program should also handle any disturbances or variations in flow, adjusting the control signals to correct for deviations from the target ratio. Discuss the importance of ratio control in maintaining the desired chemical composition and the impact of disturbances on the mixing process.

**B-A-B:**

ðŸŸ¥ B (Before) â€“ The Challenge

In continuous chemical mixing processes, maintaining the correct mixing ratio of reactants is essential for ensuring product quality and process efficiency. Without ratio control, deviations in flow due to pump inconsistencies or process disturbances can result in incorrect formulations, leading to off-spec products, waste, or even hazardous reactions.

ðŸŸ© A (After) â€“ The Ideal Outcome

Create a self-contained IEC 61131-3 Structured Text program (not a function block) that:
	â€¢	Implements ratio control to mix two reactants in a 2:1 ratio (A:B)
	â€¢	Dynamically adjusts flow rates in real time to maintain the ratio despite disturbances
	â€¢	Continuously monitors the flow of both reactants and recalculates the required flow rate of B based on A
	â€¢	Reacts to deviations by correcting the flow control signal to restore the correct ratio
	â€¢	Ensures stable and accurate chemical composition in the final mixed product

ðŸŸ§ B (Bridge) â€“ The Implementation Strategy

Hereâ€™s an example Structured Text implementation of the ratio control logic:

VAR
    Flow_A_PV : REAL;               // Measured flow rate of reactant A
    Flow_B_PV : REAL;               // Measured flow rate of reactant B
    Flow_B_SP : REAL;               // Setpoint flow for reactant B

    Ratio_Setpoint : REAL := 2.0;   // Desired ratio A:B = 2:1
    Tolerance : REAL := 0.05;       // Acceptable ratio error margin

    Actual_Ratio : REAL;
    Error : REAL;
END_VAR

// Calculate actual ratio
IF Flow_B_PV > 0.0 THEN
    Actual_Ratio := Flow_A_PV / Flow_B_PV;
ELSE
    Actual_Ratio := 0.0;
END_IF

// Calculate target flow for reactant B
Flow_B_SP := Flow_A_PV / Ratio_Setpoint;

// Check deviation
Error := Actual_Ratio - Ratio_Setpoint;

// Optional: Take action if Error exceeds tolerance
// (e.g., raise an alarm, adjust valves, etc.)

// Flow_B_SP can be sent to a PID loop or analog output to control pump B

// Flow_B_SP can be sent to a PID loop or analog output to control pump B
This logic:
	â€¢	Monitors the actual ratio by dividing the flow of A by the flow of B
	â€¢	Calculates the required flow of B to maintain the 2:1 ratio
	â€¢	Can be integrated with a PID loop or analog output to control the pump
	â€¢	Ensures that any disturbance in flow is automatically corrected

The ratio control logic is crucial in maintaining the chemical composition of the mixed product, improving product consistency, and reducing waste or rework.
