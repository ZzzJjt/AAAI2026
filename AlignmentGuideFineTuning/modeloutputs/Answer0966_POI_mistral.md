ðŸŸ© A (Action)
	â€¢	Implement a discrete-time, 2-state Kalman filter using only scalar arithmetic, avoiding matrix operations or recursion
	â€¢	Accept configurable inputs:
	â€¢	MeasuredPosition : REAL
	â€¢	Q : REAL â€“ process noise covariance
	â€¢	R : REAL â€“ measurement noise covariance
	â€¢	DeltaT : REAL â€“ sample time
	â€¢	Reset : BOOL â€“ to reinitialize state
	â€¢	Internally manage variables for:
	â€¢	Estimated position and velocity
	â€¢	Previous position (for velocity update)
	â€¢	Error covariance and Kalman gain
	â€¢	Perform prediction and update steps each scan cycle
	â€¢	Add clear comments for each stage of the algorithm to support maintainability and clarity

2.	The filter should be initialized with sensible default values for Q, R, and initial state if the Reset input is true.
3.	The filter should be able to handle the case where the Reset input is false, continuing to update the state estimates based on the previous measurements.
4.	The filter should be designed to minimize the computational overhead, making it suitable for real-time control applications.
5.	The filter should be designed to be easily integrated into a larger motion control system, with clear input and output variables and minimal dependencies on external resources.
6.	The filter should be thoroughly tested to ensure its accuracy and robustness under various noise conditions and initial conditions.
