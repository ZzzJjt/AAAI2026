### Intent:
**Intent Summary:**  
Create a comprehensive reference guide for IEC 61131-3 Structured Text, covering keywords, data types, functions, and usage examples, to support standardized PLC programming and onboarding.  

**For OOP Extensions (After Section):**  
Explain and demonstrate IEC 61131-3's object-oriented features (classes, inheritance, polymorphism) with a practical actuator/valve control example, evaluating their industrial applicability and trade-offs.  

**Bridge (Combined Intent):**  
Develop a dual-purpose resource: (1) a syntax reference for Structured Text, and (2) a practical guide to OOP in IEC 61131-3, focusing on reusable industrial automation components like valve control systems.

### Prompt:
**Programming Reference:**
Compile a comprehensive list of all valid keywords used in the IEC 61131-3 Structured Text programming language, ensuring that it covers both standard control flow structures and data types. Include examples of usage for key functions where applicable.

**R-I-S-E:**

ðŸŸ¥ R (Role)

You are an automation engineer or PLC programmer working with the IEC 61131-3 Structured Text language. Your role involves writing reliable, maintainable, and standards-compliant industrial automation code.

â¸»

ðŸŸ© I (Input)

You are provided with a task to compile a complete programming reference for Structured Text, which should include:
	â€¢	All valid keywords, such as control flow commands (IF, CASE, FOR, etc.)
	â€¢	All standard data types (BOOL, INT, REAL, TIME, etc.)
	â€¢	Commonly used function blocks (TON, CTU, TP, etc.)
	â€¢	A selection of code snippets demonstrating typical usage

This reference is meant to support development, debugging, and learning across various automation projects.

â¸»

ðŸŸ§ S (Steps)
	1.	Identify and list all reserved keywords from the IEC 61131-3 standard.
	2.	Categorize keywords by type:
	â€¢	Control flow (e.g., IF, WHILE, REPEAT)
	â€¢	Data types (e.g., REAL, STRING, TIME)
	â€¢	Constants and operators (e.g., TRUE, FALSE, AND, MOD)
	3.	Include key standard functions and function blocks with:
	â€¢	Descriptions of their purpose
	â€¢	Required inputs and outputs
	â€¢	Syntax and example usage
	4.	Format the reference as a developer-friendly guide:
	â€¢	Alphabetical list or categorized table
	â€¢	Code blocks for clarity
	â€¢	Annotations or tooltips for explanation

â¸»

ðŸŸ¦ E (Expectation)

Deliver a comprehensive and readable reference guide that:
	â€¢	Serves as a quick lookup tool for developers writing or reviewing Structured Text code
	â€¢	Supports learning and onboarding of new team members
	â€¢	Helps ensure coding consistency and standards compliance across projects
	â€¢	Can be exported as a PDF, embedded in an IDE, or hosted on a wiki/intranet site
