### Intent:
**Intent Summary:**  
Develop an ISA-88-compliant IEC 61131-3 Structured Text program to automate batch PVC production via polymerization, including sequential control of polymerize, decover, and dry stages with modular operations (e.g., reactor evacuation, material charging, temperature/pressure control) and fault handling.  

*(Focus: Batch process automation, ISA-88 structure, PVC polymerization stages, safety/scalability.)*

### Prompt:
**Batch PVC:**

Develop a self-contained program in IEC 61131-3 Structured Text for the sequential control of a reactor in the batch production of polyvinylchloride (PVC) via polymerization of vinyl chloride monomers. The program should follow an ISA-88 control recipe structure and include the following process stages: polymerize, decover, and dry. Each stage should consist of ordered operations, including preparing the reactor by evacuating it to remove oxygen, charging the reactor with demineralized water and surfactants, and reacting by adding vinyl chloride monomer and catalyst while controlling the temperature between 55-60Â°C until the pressure decreases.

Provide detailed content for key methods such as EvacuateReactor, which should handle the removal of oxygen, and AddDemineralizedWater, ensuring precise process parameters and timers are integrated. Additionally, discuss the application of ISA-88 principles in structuring the control recipe and the challenges involved in scaling the recipe for industrial use.

**ISA-88:**

ISA-88 is a set of standards for manufacturing operations management (MOM) and control system design. It provides a framework for organizing control recipes, equipment models, and data structures. The ISA-88 standard is widely used in the chemical, food, and pharmaceutical industries for batch process automation.

ISA-88 defines three levels of structure:
	1. Level 1: Control recipes, which are the basic building blocks of a control system.
	2. Level 2: Equipment models, which represent the physical equipment in the process.
	3. Level 3: Data structures, which provide a way to store and exchange data between the control system and other systems.

ISA-88 also provides guidelines for organizing control logic, including procedural and equipment models, and for defining data structures and communication protocols.

**ISA-88 Principles:**

1. **Procedural Model:** The procedural model is used to define the control logic of the process. It consists of a series of procedures that are executed in a specific order.
2. **Equipment Model:** The equipment model represents the physical equipment in the process. It includes information such as the type of equipment, its location, and its status.
3. **Data Model:** The data model is used to define the data structures that are used in the control system. It includes information such as the data types, the data values, and the data relationships.

**ISA-88 Structure in Batch PVC Production:**

1. **Control Recipe:** The control recipe defines the overall process and the sequence of operations. It includes procedures for each stage of the process, such as polymerize, decover, and dry.
2. **Equipment Model:** The equipment model represents the physical equipment used in the process, such as the reactor, the temperature sensors, and the pressure sensors.
3. **Data Model:** The data model defines the data structures used in the control system, such as the temperature, pressure, and time values.

**ISA-88 Scalability:**

ISA-88 is designed to be scalable, which means that it can be used to control processes of any size, from small batch processes to large-scale continuous processes. The modular structure of ISA-88 allows for easy expansion and modification of the control system as the process grows or changes.

ISA-88 also supports the use of
