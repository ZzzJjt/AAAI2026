**UreaReactionControl Program Documentation**

**Overview:**
The UreaReactionControl program automates the urea synthesis process by managing valve operations, monitoring pressure and temperature, and executing timed reaction steps. It ensures the proper loading of raw materials and the controlled reaction process.

**Variables:**

**Inputs:**
- `stAmmoniaValve`: TRUE when the ammonia valve is open.
- `stCO2Valve`: TRUE when the COâ‚‚ valve is open.
- `rCurrentPressure`: Current reactor pressure in bars.
- `rCurrentTemperature`: Current reactor temperature in degrees Celsius.

**Outputs:**
- `stAmmoniaValveControl`: TRUE to open the ammonia valve.
- `stCO2ValveControl`: TRUE to open the COâ‚‚ valve.

**Internals:**
- `stStep1`: TRUE when the raw materials are loaded.
- `stStep2`: TRUE when the controlled reaction is in progress.
- `stReactionFinished`: TRUE when the reaction is complete.
- `tReactionTimer`: Reaction timer.

**Parameters:**
- `rTargetPressure`: Target reactor pressure in bars.
- `rPressureTolerance`: Pressure tolerance in bars.
- `rTargetTemperature`: Target reactor temperature in degrees Celsius.
- `rTemperatureTolerance`: Temperature tolerance in degrees Celsius.
- `tReactionTime`: Total reaction time in minutes.

**Logic Flow:**

1. **Step 1: Load Raw Materials**
   - If `stStep1` is FALSE:
     - Set `stAmmoniaValveControl` and `stCO2ValveControl` to TRUE.
     - Check if both valves are open.
     - If both valves are open, set `stStep1` to TRUE and record the current time as `tReactionTimer`.

2. **Step 2: Control Reaction**
   - If `stStep2` is FALSE:
     - Check if the current pressure and temperature are within the target range.
     - If both conditions are met:
       - Check if the reaction time has been reached.
       - If the reaction time has been reached, set `stStep2` to TRUE.
     - If the conditions are not met:
       - Adjust the valves based on pressure and temperature.

3. **Reaction Completion**
   - If `stReactionFinished` is FALSE:
     - Close all valves and mark the reaction as finished.

**Control Conditions and Safety Handling:**
- The program uses `CURRENT_TIME
