### Intent:
**Intent Summary:**  
Create a reusable IEC 61131-3 Structured Text function block (`SineFunction`) that computes the sine of an angle (in radians) using either the built-in `SIN()` function or a Taylor series approximation, with robust handling of edge cases (e.g., large angles, numerical overflow), real-time optimization, and clear documentation for industrial automation applications like motion control or signal generation.  

*(Focus: Precision, portability, deterministic execution, and error handling for PLC environments.)*

### Prompt:
**Linear Interpolation:**

Create a self-contained function block in IEC 61131-3 Structured Text to compute linear interpolation between two points. Ensure the function block is designed for general use, with detailed comments explaining the mathematical formula behind the interpolation process. Discuss considerations for precision and potential rounding errors, as well as the function blockâ€™s suitability for use in industrial control systems where real-time responsiveness is critical.

**B-A-B:**

ðŸŸ¥ B (Before) â€“ The Challenge

In industrial automation, many control applications require estimating a value between two known pointsâ€”for example, scaling sensor signals, adjusting setpoints, or performing table lookups. Without a reliable interpolation function, engineers often hardcode formulas, which can lead to errors, poor maintainability, and rounding issues that compromise system accuracy or responsiveness.

ðŸŸ© A (After) â€“ The Ideal Outcome

Develop a self-contained IEC 61131-3 Structured Text function block named LinearInterpolation that:
	â€¢	Accepts five inputs:
	â€¢	X1, Y1: Coordinates of the first known point
	â€¢	X2, Y2: Coordinates of the second known point
	â€¢	X: The target X-value for which Y should be interpolated
	â€¢	Returns Y as the interpolated result using the formula:
Y := Y1 + ((X - X1) \times (Y2 - Y1)) / (X2 - X1)
	â€¢	Includes detailed comments explaining:
	â€¢	The formula used
	â€¢	Handling of edge cases like division by zero
	â€¢	The effect of limited precision and rounding on REAL values in PLCs
	â€¢	Is optimized for real-time responsiveness and general-purpose use in control systems, such as HMI scaling, analog conversion, or PID setpoint adjustments

ðŸŸ§ B (Bridge) â€“ The Implementation Strategy

To implement this solution:
	1.	Define the function block interface:
 FUNCTION_BLOCK LinearInterpolation
VAR_INPUT
    X1, Y1, X2, Y2, X : REAL;
END_VAR
VAR_OUTPUT
    Y : REAL;
END_VAR
	2.	Implement the interpolation logic with error checks:
 IF X2 <> X1 THEN
    Y := Y1 + ((X - X1) * (Y2 - Y1)) / (X2 - X1);
ELSE
    Y := Y1; // or raise a diagnostic flag
END_IF;
	3.	Add explanatory comments and document performance characteristics, including:
	â€¢	Impact of small denominators on numerical stability
	â€¢	Precision trade-offs in PLC floating-point arithmetic
	â€¢	Application scenarios (e.g., analog scaling, motion control interpolation, lookup tables)

This makes the function block robust, transparent, and ready for industrial deployment, especially in systems that require reliable real-time interpolation.
