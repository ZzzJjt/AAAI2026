ðŸŸ© I (Input) â€“ Information Provided

You are to implement a binary search algorithm within a function block that operates on an array of 100 integers. The function must:
	â€¢	Accept a sorted array, a target value, and an enable trigger
	â€¢	Perform input validation (e.g., index bounds, empty range)
	â€¢	Efficiently manage search boundaries (low, high, mid)
	â€¢	Return both a boolean flag (Found) and the index where the value was located (or -1 if not found)

ðŸŸ§ S (Steps) â€“ Steps to Perform
	1.	Define a function block interface with inputs:
	â€¢	SearchArray : ARRAY[1..100] OF INT
	â€¢	TargetValue : INT
	â€¢	Enable : BOOL
	2.	Add internal variables for Low, High, Mid, and Found.
	3.	Use a WHILE loop to implement binary search logic:
	â€¢	Compare the middle element with the target
	â€¢	Adjust Low or High accordingly
	â€¢	Break on match or conclude if Low > High
	4.	Output:
	â€¢	Found : BOOL
	â€¢	Index : INT (valid index or -1)
	5.	Include input validation and comment the logic for maintainability.

ðŸŸ¦ E (Expectation) â€“ Expected Outcome

Deliver a robust, reusable Structured Text function block that efficiently performs binary search on a fixed-size array. The implementation should be:
	â€¢	Scan-cycle safe for use in real-time PLC environments
	â€¢	Modular, with clear documentation and boundary checks
	â€¢	Adaptable for future use cases involving longer arrays or dynamic array sizes (with minor modifications)

**Reflection:**
This challenge was a great opportunity to practice implementing a binary search algorithm in IEC 61131-3 Structured Text. The challenge provided a clear and concise set of requirements, which made it easy to focus on the task at hand.

The first step was to define the function block interface, which included inputs for the search array, target value, and enable trigger, as well as outputs for the found flag and index. Next, I added internal variables for low, high, mid, and found, which would be used to manage the search boundaries and track the search progress.

The main logic of the function block was implemented using a while loop, which iterated through the search array and compared the target value with the middle element. If the target value was found, the loop was exited and the found flag was set to true. If the target value was not found, the loop adjusted the low or high boundary accordingly and continued searching.

To ensure that the function block was scan-cycle safe for use in real-time PLC environments, I added input validation to check for empty ranges and index bounds. This helped to prevent any potential errors or unexpected behavior in the function block.

Overall, this challenge was a great learning experience and helped me to improve my skills in implementing efficient and
