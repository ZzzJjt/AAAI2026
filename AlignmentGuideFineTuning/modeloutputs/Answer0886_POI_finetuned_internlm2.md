### Intent:
**Intent Summary:**  
Create a structured text PLC program to control entry/exit traffic lights for a single-lane underground car park, ensuring only one car uses the passage at a time by coordinating sensors (X1/X2) and lights (Y1/Y2), with initial free-flow conditions.

### Prompt:
**Entry/Exit Control for Underground Car Park Using 61131-3 Structured Text:**

Write a PLC program in structured text (ST) according to IEC 61131-3 to control the entry and exit of an underground car park. The system uses the following sensors and actuators:

	â€¢	Sensors:
	â€¢	X1: Photoelectric switch at the ground floor entry/exit. It will be ON when a car passes.
	â€¢	X2: Photoelectric switch at the basement entry/exit. It will be ON when a car passes.
	â€¢	M1: ON for one scan cycle when a car from the ground floor passes X1.
	â€¢	M2: ON for one scan cycle when a car from the basement passes X1.
	â€¢	M3: ON for one scan cycle when a car from the basement passes X2.
	â€¢	M4: ON for one scan cycle when a car from the ground floor passes X2.
	â€¢	Intermediate Variables:
	â€¢	M20: ON during the process of a car entering the passage from the ground floor.
	â€¢	M30: ON during the process of a car entering the passage from the basement.
	â€¢	Output Devices:
	â€¢	Y1: Red lights at the entry/exit of the ground floor and the basement.
	â€¢	Y2: Green lights at the entry/exit of the ground floor and the basement.

Process Description:

The entry and exit of the underground car park is controlled by a single lane passage, with traffic lights regulating car movement. The red lights (Y1) prohibit cars from entering or leaving, while the green lights (Y2) allow movement.

	â€¢	When a car enters the passage from the ground floor entry, the red lights at both the ground floor and basement turn ON, while the green lights turn OFF, preventing any other cars from entering or leaving until the car passes through the passage.
	â€¢	Similarly, when a car enters from the basement, the red lights will turn ON at both entry points, prohibiting other vehicles from entering or leaving until the car passes through.
	â€¢	When the passage is clear, the green lights will turn ON again, allowing cars to enter or exit freely.
	â€¢	Initially, the PLC should set the green lights ON and the red lights OFF to indicate free movement.

ðŸŸ¥ T (Task) â€“ What You Need to Do

Develop a Structured Text (ST) program using IEC 61131-3 to control entry and exit traffic lights for a single-lane underground car park shared by the ground floor and basement. The system must prevent cars from entering the passage at both ends simultaneously by coordinating sensor inputs and traffic light outputs.

**R:**

ðŸŸ¥ R (Reasoning) â€“ Why It Matters

This program is crucial for managing the flow of vehicles in a single-lane underground car park, ensuring safety and preventing collisions. By coordinating sensor inputs and traffic light outputs, the system can effectively regulate entry and exit, allowing only one car to pass through at a time. This prevents simultaneous entry from both directions, ensuring the passage remains clear for other vehicles. The program also automatically resets the traffic lights once the passage is clear, allowing free movement of cars. By following the IEC 61131-3 standard for structured text, the program can be easily implemented in a PLC, ensuring reliable and efficient control of the car parkâ€™s traffic flow.

**E:**

ðŸŸ© E (Example) â€“ How It Works

Here is an example of how the program would work in a real-world scenario:

	â€¢	Initially, the green lights (Y1 and Y2) are ON, allowing free movement of cars.
	â€¢	A car approaches the ground floor entry (X1) and triggers M1.
	â€¢	The program sets M20 to TRUE, indicating that a car is in the passage from the ground floor.
	â€¢	The red lights (Y1) at both the ground floor and basement turn ON, while the green lights turn OFF, preventing other cars from entering or leaving.
	â€¢	Once the car passes through the passage, M20 is set to FALSE, and the red lights at both entry points turn OFF, allowing other cars to enter or exit freely.
	â€¢	When a car approaches the basement entry (X2) and triggers M2, the same process occurs, with M30 set to TRUE and the red lights at both entry points turning ON.
	â€¢	Once the car passes through, M30 is set to FALSE, and the red lights turn OFF, allowing free movement again.
	â€¢	When both M20 and M30 are FALSE, indicating that the passage is clear, the green lights (Y1 and Y2) turn ON, allowing cars to enter or exit freely.

**I:**

ðŸŸ© I (Implementation) â€“ The Code

Here is the implementation of the traffic light control program in structured text (ST) using IEC 61131-3:

	IF (X1 AND M1 = FALSE) THEN
		M1 := TRUE;
	END_IF;

	IF (X2 AND M2 = FALSE) THEN
