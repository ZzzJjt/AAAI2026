### Intent:
**Intent Summary:**  
Create a Structured Text function block to monitor and diagnose a PowerLink node's communication status, error conditions, and health, with configurable polling and error logging for real-time network maintenance.

### Prompt:
**Profibus DP Diagnostics Using 61131-3 Structured Text:**

Develop a self-contained 61131-3 structured text function block to read diagnostic data from a Profibus DP slave device. The function block should handle communication with the Profibus DP slave and retrieve diagnostic information such as device status, error codes, and communication health. Provide an explanation of the key steps in processing the diagnostic data, including request initiation, data retrieval, and error handling mechanisms.

**R-I-S-E:**

ðŸŸ¥ R (Role) â€“ Your Role

Act as a PLC programmer developing diagnostic and communication monitoring tools for Profibus DP networks using IEC 61131-3 Structured Text.

â¸»

ðŸŸ© I (Input) â€“ What Youâ€™re Given

You are tasked with creating a self-contained Structured Text (ST) function block that reads diagnostic data from a Profibus DP slave device. The function block must retrieve key information such as device status, error codes, and communication health, and expose execution status and error flags for use in control applications.

â¸»

ðŸŸ§ S (Steps) â€“ What You Need to Do
	1.	Define a function block interface with the following:
	â€¢	Inputs: Execute (BOOL), SlaveAddress (BYTE), Timeout (TIME)
	â€¢	Outputs: Done (BOOL), Busy (BOOL), Error (BOOL), ErrorID (DWORD), plus structured diagnostic outputs (e.g. DeviceStatus, CommState)
	2.	Inside the function block:
	â€¢	Detect rising edge of Execute to start the diagnostic read
	â€¢	Send a Profibus DP diagnostic request using the slave address
	â€¢	Wait for response and validate it within the given Timeout
	â€¢	Parse the response to extract error flags, status codes, and communication health indicators
	â€¢	Set output flags (Done, Error) and assign the parsed data to output variables
	3.	Implement internal error handling for timeouts, invalid responses, or communication loss. Provide ErrorID codes for troubleshooting.

ðŸŸ¦ E (Expectation) â€“ What Success Looks Like

The function block allows the PLC program to retrieve and react to real-time diagnostic data from any Profibus DP slave. Operators and maintenance systems gain early visibility into device issues, while control logic can trigger alarms or fallback procedures based on accurate status and error conditionsâ€”improving system uptime and maintainability.

**Additional Information:**

**Profibus DP** is a fieldbus standard for industrial automation, used to connect devices such as sensors, actuators, and drives to a central controller. It is based on the RS-485 serial communication protocol and operates at a maximum speed of 12 Mbps. Profibus DP is commonly used in process control and manufacturing applications, where it provides a reliable and efficient way to transmit data between devices.

**Structured Text (ST)** is a programming language used in industrial automation and control systems. It is based on the Pascal programming language and is designed to be easy to read and understand by engineers and technicians. ST is commonly used to program PLCs and other control devices, and is supported by many PLC programming tools and software packages.

**Diagnostic data** refers to information about the health and performance of a device or system. In the context of Profibus DP, diagnostic data may include information about the status of a device, error codes, and communication health indicators. This data can be used to monitor the performance of a device and to identify and troubleshoot issues that may arise.

**Error handling** refers to the process of detecting and responding to errors or exceptions in a program or system. In the context of Profibus DP, error handling may involve detecting and responding to communication errors, invalid responses, or timeouts. This can help to ensure that the system remains stable and that any issues are identified and addressed in a timely manner.

**Error codes** are numerical or alphanumeric values that are used to identify specific errors or exceptions in a program or system. In the context of Profibus DP, error codes may be used to identify specific issues that have occurred during communication or data transfer. These codes can be used to help troubleshoot and resolve issues, and may be displayed or logged for later analysis.

**Communication health indicators** are metrics or values that provide information about the health and performance of a communication system. In the context of Profibus DP, communication health indicators may include metrics such as communication speed, error rates, and response times. These indicators can be used to monitor the performance of the communication system and to identify and address any issues that may arise.

**PLC program** refers to a program or set of instructions that is used to control a PLC or other control device. PLCs are commonly used in industrial automation and control systems, and are programmed using languages such as Structured Text (ST) or Ladder Logic (LD). PLC programs are typically designed to perform specific tasks or functions, such
