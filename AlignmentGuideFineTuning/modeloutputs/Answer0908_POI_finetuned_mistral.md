### Intent:
Develop a cascade control system in IEC 61131-3 Structured Text that regulates gas turbine pressure (outer loop) by dynamically adjusting flow setpoints (inner loop) through proportional control, with separate timing constraints and output clamping for safe operation.

### Prompt:
**PID Temperature Control Gas Turbine:**

Develop a self-contained IEC 61131-3 Structured Text program to implement PID feedback control for regulating the temperature inside a gas turbine. The control program should manage the opening of an inlet valve based on a temperature setpoint, ensuring that the PID controller adjusts the valve position to maintain optimal turbine performance.

The program should include the necessary PID parameters (proportional, integral, and derivative gains) and logic to handle deviations from the temperature setpoint. Also, incorporate limits on the valve opening to ensure safe operation. Discuss the challenges of temperature regulation in gas turbines, focusing on system dynamics, response time, and maintaining stability under varying load conditions.

**T-A-G:**

🟥 T (Task) – What You Need to Do

Write a self-contained IEC 61131-3 Structured Text program (not a function block) to implement PID feedback control for regulating the temperature inside a gas turbine. The program must manage the opening of an inlet valve to maintain a desired temperature setpoint.

⸻

🟩 A (Action) – How to Do It
	1.	Measure the turbine’s internal temperature (Temp_PV) and compare it to the target setpoint (Temp_SP := 950.0).
	2.	Apply PID control logic with the following parameters:
	•	Proportional gain Kp := 3.0
	•	Integral gain Ki := 0.7
	•	Derivative gain Kd := 0.2
	3.	Execute control calculations every 100 ms, using the current and previous error to compute:
	•	Integral: accumulated error
	•	Derivative: rate of change
	•	Output: valve position
	4.	Clamp the valve output (Valve_Position) between 0% and 100% to ensure safe operation.
	5.	Update the previous error for use in the next cycle.

⸻

🟦 G (Goal) – What You Want to Achieve
	•	Maintain stable turbine inlet temperature under dynamic load conditions
	•	Ensure efficient valve control without overshooting or lag
	•	Prevent overheating or underperformance, ensuring reliable turbine operation
	•	Deliver a real-time PLC-compatible solution that’s easy to deploy and tune
