### Intent:
**Intent Summary:**  
Create a reusable IEC 61131-3 structured text function block to compare two REAL values with configurable decimal precision, handling rounding errors and providing comparison outputs (Equal/Greater/Less) and error flags.  

*(Focus: Precision-aware floating-point comparison for reliable industrial logic.)*

### Prompt:
**Real Comparator:**
Implement a self-contained function block in IEC 61131-3 structured text to compare two real inputs up to n decimal places. Include configurable precision and error handling.

**B-A-B:**

ðŸŸ¥ B (Before) â€“ The Problem or Challenge

In many industrial control systems, comparing floating-point values (REAL types) directly can lead to unreliable results due to rounding errors and floating-point representation limits. Without a method to compare numbers with a specified decimal precision, engineers may encounter false mismatches or unstable logic in process comparisons, alarming, or control switching logic.

ðŸŸ© A (After) â€“ The Desired Outcome

Develop a self-contained function block in IEC 61131-3 Structured Text that compares two REAL inputs up to n decimal places. The function block should:
	â€¢	Accept a user-defined precision level (n)
	â€¢	Normalize or round both input values to that precision before comparison
	â€¢	Provide output flags such as Equal, Greater, and Less
	â€¢	Handle floating-point inaccuracies and include error checks (e.g., invalid precision or input range)

â¸»

ðŸŸ§ B (Bridge) â€“ How to Get There
	1.	Define the function block with inputs:
	â€¢	Input1 : REAL, Input2 : REAL
	â€¢	Precision : INT (number of decimal places to compare)
	â€¢	Enable : BOOL
	2.	Internally calculate a scaling factor based on precision:
\text{Scale} := 10^\text{Precision}
Then compare ROUND(Input1 * Scale) vs ROUND(Input2 * Scale)
	3.	Provide outputs:
	â€¢	Equal : BOOL
	â€¢	Greater : BOOL
	â€¢	Less : BOOL
	â€¢	Error : BOOL (e.g., if Precision < 0 or inputs are invalid)
	4.	Include inline comments and safeguards to ensure scan-cycle-safe operation and clarity

**Example Usage:**

```ST
VAR
  Input1 : REAL := 3.14159;
  Input2 : REAL := 3.14;
  Precision : INT := 4;
  Equal : BOOL;
  Greater : BOOL;
  Less : BOOL;
  Error : BOOL;

FunctionBlock RealComparator
  Input1 : REAL;
  Input2 : REAL;
  Precision : INT;
  Enable : BOOL;
  Equal : BOOL;
  Greater : BOOL;
  Less : BOOL;
  Error : BOOL;
BEGIN
  IF Enable THEN
    IF Precision < 0 THEN
      Error := TRUE;
    ELSE
      Equal := ROUND(Input1 * 10^Precision) = ROUND(Input2 * 10^Precision);
      Greater := ROUND(Input1 * 10^Precision) > ROUND(Input2 * 10^Precision);
      Less := ROUND(Input1 * 10^Precision) < ROUND(Input2 * 10^Precision);
    END_IF;
  END_IF;
END_FUNCTION_BLOCK;
```

**Additional Considerations:**

-	Consider the impact of precision on the performance of your control system. Higher precision may require more processing power and increase the risk of floating-point overflow.
-	Ensure that the function block is designed to be scan-cycle-safe, meaning it should not have any side effects or rely on external state that may change between scan cycles.
-	Test the function block thoroughly to ensure it works as expected in various scenarios, including edge cases and boundary conditions.
-	Document the function block clearly, including its purpose, inputs, outputs, and any limitations or assumptions.
-	Consider integrating the function block into a larger control system or application, and test its performance and reliability in that context.
-	Consider potential improvements or extensions to the function block, such as support for additional comparison operators (e.g., Not Equal) or handling of complex numbers.
