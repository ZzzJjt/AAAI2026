ðŸŸ© I (Input) â€“ What Youâ€™re Given

You are tasked with creating a self-contained function block that:
	â€¢	Accepts a REAL input array (e.g., InputSignal: ARRAY[1..64] OF REAL)

	â€¢	Output: either amplitude array or real/imaginary arrays
	2.	Implement FFT logic using:
	â€¢	Bit-reversal reordering
	â€¢	Butterfly computation with twiddle factors
	â€¢	Looping constructs that avoid recursion or dynamic memory usage
	3.	Optimize for PLC performance by:
	â€¢	Using only power-of-two input sizes
	â€¢	Precomputing or approximating sine/cosine values if needed
	â€¢	Limiting execution time to fit within typical scan cycles
	4.	Comment thoroughly, explaining:
	â€¢	Purpose of each calculation step
	â€¢	How twiddle factors are computed and applied
	â€¢	How to interpret the resulting frequency bins
	5.	Document known limitations, such as:
	â€¢	Fixed input length
	â€¢	Absence of floating-point complex number support on some PLCs

ðŸŸ¦ E (Expectation) â€“ What Success Looks Like

You deliver a modular, efficient FFT function block that performs spectral analysis in real time, suitable for:
	â€¢	Vibration monitoring
	â€¢	Motor current signature analysis
	â€¢	Predictive maintenance triggers
	â€¢	Harmonic analysis in power systems

The block should run within acceptable PLC scan times, remain numerically stable, and provide meaningful frequency-domain data without external processing tools.
