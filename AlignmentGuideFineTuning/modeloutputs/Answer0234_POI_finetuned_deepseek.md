### Intent:
**Intent Summary:**  
Develop an IEC 61131-3 Structured Text function block to retrieve and log real-time diagnostic data (communication status, errors, health) from Ethernet PowerLink control nodes via a Managing Node, enabling proactive network monitoring and fault resolution.  

*(Focus: Diagnostics, PowerLink, real-time monitoring, structured logging, error handling.)*

### Prompt:
**Ethernet PowerLink Diagnostics Using IEC 61131-3 Structured Text:**

Develop a function block in structured text (ST) based on IEC 61131 standards to retrieve Ethernet PowerLink diagnostic information from a control node device via a PowerLink managing node (MN). The function block should collect and display key diagnostic data such as communication status, error codes, and node health. The program must ensure that the diagnostic information is accurately processed and relayed to the controller for further analysis. Discuss how the function block interacts with the PowerLink network, handles error detection, and provides real-time diagnostics for maintaining network integrity.

**C-A-R-E:**

ðŸŸ¥ C (Context) â€“ The Background

In Ethernet PowerLink-based automation systems, maintaining network integrity depends on real-time access to diagnostic data from control nodes. Without a dedicated solution, operators may struggle to detect communication issues, interpret error codes, or assess node health, which can delay troubleshooting and compromise system reliability.

ðŸŸ© A (Action) â€“ The Implementation Task

Develop a function block in IEC 61131-3 Structured Text (ST) that retrieves diagnostic information from Ethernet PowerLink control nodes via a Managing Node (MN). The function block should collect key metrics such as communication status, error codes, and node health indicators. It must process this data accurately and make it available to the controller for real-time monitoring and logging. Include error detection mechanisms and ensure that the function block runs cyclically for timely updates.

ðŸŸ¨ R (Result) â€“ The Expected Outcome

The function block enables continuous, structured monitoring of PowerLink nodes, improving visibility into network status. It helps maintenance teams identify failures early, react promptly to communication breakdowns, and maintain high system availability and performance.

ðŸŸ¦ E (Example) â€“ A Practical Use Case

For example, if a node experiences a communication timeout or internal fault, the function block detects the issue, retrieves the related error code, and updates the controllerâ€™s diagnostic interface in real time. This allows operators to see exactly which node failed, why it failed, and take corrective action without manual diagnosis or delays.
