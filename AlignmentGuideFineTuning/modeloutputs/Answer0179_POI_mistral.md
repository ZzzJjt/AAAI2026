### Intent:
**Intent Summary:**  
Create a reusable IEC 61131-3 structured text function block to compare two REAL values with configurable decimal precision, handling floating-point inaccuracies and providing comparison outputs (Equal/Greater/Less) with error checking.  

*(Focus: Precision-based floating-point comparison for reliable industrial logic, avoiding direct equality checks.)*

### Prompt:
**Real Comparator:**
Implement a self-contained function block in IEC 61131-3 structured text to compare two real inputs up to n decimal places. Include configurable precision and error handling.

**B-A-B:**

🟥 B (Before) – The Problem or Challenge

In many industrial control systems, comparing floating-point values (REAL types) directly can lead to unreliable results due to rounding errors and floating-point representation limits. Without a method to compare numbers with a specified decimal precision, engineers may encounter false mismatches or unstable logic in process comparisons, alarming, or control switching logic.

⸻

🟩 A (After) – The Desired Outcome

Develop a self-contained function block in IEC 61131-3 Structured Text that compares two REAL inputs up to n decimal places. The function block should:
	•	Accept a user-defined precision level (n)
	•	Normalize or round both input values to that precision before comparison
	•	Provide output flags such as Equal, Greater, and Less
	•	Handle floating-point inaccuracies and include error checks (e.g., invalid precision or input range)

⸻

🟧 B (Bridge) – How to Get There
	1.	Define the function block with inputs:
	•	Input1 : REAL, Input2 : REAL
	•	Precision : INT (number of decimal places to compare)
	•	Enable : BOOL
	2.	Internally calculate a scaling factor based on precision:
\text{Scale} := 10^\text{Precision}
Then compare ROUND(Input1 * Scale) vs ROUND(Input2 * Scale)
	3.	Provide outputs:
	•	Equal : BOOL
	•	Greater : BOOL
	•	Less : BOOL
	•	Error : BOOL (e.g., if Precision < 0 or inputs are invalid)
	4.	Include inline comments and safeguards to ensure scan-cycle-safe operation and clarity

**Code Example:**

```
FUNCTION_BLOCK RealComparator
  VAR
    Input1, Input2, Scale : REAL;
    Error, Equal, Greater, Less : BOOL;
  END_VAR

  IF Enable THEN
    Scale := 10.0^Precision;
    Input1 := ROUND(Input1 * Scale);
    Input2 := ROUND(Input2 * Scale);

    Equal := Input1 = Input2;
    Greater := Input1 > Input2;
    Less := Input1 < Input2;

    Error := Precision < 0 OR Input1 < 0 OR Input2 < 0;
  END_IF;
END_FUNCTION_BLOCK
```

**Notes:**

-	This example assumes a PLC with IEC 61131-3 support and a structured text programming environment.
-	The function block can be reused in various parts of the control system, providing reliable floating-point comparisons with user-defined precision.
-	The function block can be further optimized by using a lookup table or other techniques to minimize the number of floating-point operations.
-	Ensure that the function block is properly initialized and tested to avoid unintended behavior or errors.
