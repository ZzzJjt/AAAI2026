	â€¢	Temp_SP: The temperature setpoint (e.g., 950Â°C)
	â€¢	PID gains:
	â€¢	Proportional: Kp := 3.0

ðŸŸ§ S (Steps) â€“ What You Need to Do
	1.	Calculate the error between the setpoint and measured temperature:
Error := Temp_SP - Temp_PV
	2.	Accumulate the integral term based on the error and cycle time:
Integral := Integral + Error * 0.1
	3.	Calculate the derivative using the difference between the current and previous error:
Derivative := (Error - Prev_Error) / 0.1
	4.	Compute the PID output to determine valve position:
Valve_Position := (Kp * Error) + (Ki * Integral) + (Kd * Derivative)
	5.	Clamp the valve output to stay within the defined operational limits
	6.	Store the current error in Prev_Error for the next cycle

ðŸŸ¦ E (Expectation) â€“ What Success Looks Like

**Challenges:**

1.	Temperature regulation in gas turbines is challenging due to the complex dynamics and non-linearities of the system. The response time of the PID controller must be optimized to account for these factors, ensuring fast and accurate control while maintaining stability under varying load conditions.
2.	Maintaining stability is crucial to prevent oscillations or instability in the system. This can be achieved by tuning the PID gains appropriately and implementing anti-windup strategies to prevent integral windup.
3.	The PID controller must be robust to handle disturbances such as fuel variability, thermal inertia, and mechanical wear. This can be achieved by incorporating adaptive control strategies or using advanced control techniques like fuzzy logic or model predictive control.
4.	Ensuring safety is paramount in gas turbine control systems. This includes implementing limits on valve actuation, monitoring system health, and providing fail-safe mechanisms in case of controller failure or abnormal operation.
5.	The PID controller must be designed for high-reliability operation in harsh environments, with minimal maintenance requirements and robustness to noise and measurement errors. This can be achieved by implementing redundancy, error detection and correction, and robust control design techniques.
6.	The PID controller must be easily configurable and adaptable to different gas turbine models and operating conditions. This can be achieved by implementing modular design principles, using parameter tuning algorithms, and providing user-friendly interfaces for configuration and tuning.
7.	The PID controller must be easily integrated with other control systems and communication protocols, such as Modbus, Profibus, or Ethernet/IP, to facilitate seamless integration with supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) systems and other plant equipment.
8.	The PID controller must be designed for scalability, allowing for easy expansion to control multiple gas turbines or other plant equipment in a distributed control system. This can be achieved by implementing object-oriented programming principles, using standardized communication protocols, and providing modular design elements.
9.	The PID controller must be designed for ease of maintenance, with clear documentation, easy-to-understand code, and robust error handling and diagnostics. This can be achieved by implementing best practices in
