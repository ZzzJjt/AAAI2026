ðŸŸ© E (Environment) â€“ Startup Sequence

The press section of a Valmet paper machine requires a precise startup sequence to ensure safe and efficient operation. The startup sequence should include the following phases:

1.	**System Readiness Check:** Verify that all mechanical components are in a safe and ready state before initiating the startup process.

2.	**Conveyor and Roll Pre-Rotation:** Start the conveyor and press roll motors at a low speed to ensure proper alignment and synchronization.

3.	**Temperature Preheating:** Gradually increase the temperature of the press roll and nip area to the desired range (85â€“90Â°C) to prevent thermal shock and ensure even pressure distribution.

4.	**Nip Pressure Ramp-Up:** Control the hydraulic system to gradually increase the nip pressure to the target value (250 kN/m) while monitoring the temperature and pressure sensors for stability.

5.	**Speed Synchronization and Ramp-Up:** Once the nip pressure is stable, synchronize the conveyor and press roll speeds to ensure smooth transfer of the paper sheet. Gradually ramp up the speed to the operational target (e.g., 500 m/min) while monitoring the synchronization and safety conditions.
