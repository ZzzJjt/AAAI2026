### Intent:
**Intent Summary:**  
Create a reusable Quicksort function block in IEC 61131-3 Structured Text to sort integer arrays iteratively (using stack-based bounds tracking) for PLC applications, with configurable execution control and completion signaling.  

*(Focus: Industrial sorting utility for PLCs, emphasizing iterative implementation, input/output handling, and deterministic execution.)*

### Prompt:

ðŸŸ© A (Action)
	â€¢	Define the following inputs:
	â€¢	Setpoint, ProcessVariable (for error calculation)
	â€¢	Kp, Ki, Kd (gain tuning parameters)
	â€¢	MinOutput, MaxOutput (output clamping)
	â€¢	Enable, Reset (runtime control flags)
	â€¢	Create the PID logic:
	â€¢	Compute the control error: Error := Setpoint - ProcessVariable
	â€¢	Accumulate the integral term using Ki and DeltaT, with anti-windup logic
	â€¢	Calculate the derivative term from the rate of change of the process variable
	â€¢	Compute the control output and apply output limits
	â€¢	Reset internal states if Reset = TRUE
	â€¢	Use internal memory to track previous values and ensure smooth scan-cycle execution
	â€¢	Include comments for each computation block to improve readability and maintenance

ðŸŸ¦ G (Goal)

Deliver a robust, tunable, and reusable PID controller function block that performs well in real-time industrial control applications. The block should ensure safe, stable, and accurate output control with built-in safeguards like anti-windup and clamping, making it suitable for integration into any PLC-based closed-loop control system.
