*(Concise, task-focused, and captures the core automation objective.)*

### Prompt:
**List Mathematical Function Blocks:**
Compile a detailed list of all mathematical function blocks available in the OSCAT library for PLC programming, including a brief description of their functionality and typical use cases.

**C-A-R-E:**

ðŸŸ¥ C (Context) â€“ Background

You are developing control logic using a PLC programming environment and leveraging the OSCAT library, a widely used open-source library for automation. The OSCAT library offers a large number of mathematical function blocks, but they are spread across modules and lack a centralized, user-friendly summary.
