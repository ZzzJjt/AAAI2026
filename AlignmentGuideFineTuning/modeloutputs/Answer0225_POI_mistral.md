### Intent:
**Intent Summary:**  
Develop a structured text function block to register/deregister CAN Open IDs (COBIDs) with status tracking, ensuring no duplicates and handling buffer management.

### Prompt:
**IO-Link Data Acquisition Using 61131-3 Structured Text:**

Develop a function block in structured text (ST) based on IEC 61131 standards to read five values from a remote IO-Link master. The function block should handle communication with the IO-Link master, retrieve the required process data, and provide the status of each read operation. Discuss the methodology used for error checking, status reporting, and handling of potential communication issues between the IO-Link master and the connected devices.

**C-A-R-E:**

ðŸŸ¥ C (Context) â€“ The Background

IO-Link is widely used in modern industrial systems to connect sensors and actuators to controllers via standardized communication. However, without structured data acquisition logic, communication failures, missing data, or undetected errors can lead to unreliable operation and difficult troubleshooting.

ðŸŸ© A (Action) â€“ The Implementation Task

Develop a function block in IEC 61131-3 Structured Text (ST) that reads five process values from a remote IO-Link master. The block should handle communication requests, retrieve each value reliably, and return a status for every read operation. The function block must include error checking logic to detect communication failures and respond appropriately, such as retrying or flagging an error.

ðŸŸ¨ R (Result) â€“ The Expected Outcome

The function block enables accurate and transparent IO-Link data acquisition, ensures that each value read is validated and confirmed, and provides the controller with both the data and its communication status. This enhances diagnostics, improves system robustness, and reduces downtime due to silent failures or corrupted reads.

ðŸŸ¦ E (Example) â€“ A Practical Use Case

For example, when the controller requests five sensor values from an IO-Link master, the function block attempts to read each one in sequence. If one read fails due to a timeout or device fault, the function block sets an error status for that value while successfully delivering the other four. The controller can then take appropriate actionsâ€”such as issuing a retry, generating an alarm, or isolating the faulty device.

**Function Block Design:**

1. Define the function block inputs and outputs:
   - Inputs:
     - `IO_Link_Master_Address`: The IO-Link master's address (e.g., 12345678).
     - `IO_Link_Data_Request`: A boolean signal to initiate the data acquisition cycle.
     - `IO_Link_Data_Buffer`: A buffer to store the received data.
   - Outputs:
     - `IO_Link_Data_Status`: A status array indicating the success or failure of each read operation.
     - `IO_Link_Data_Values`: An array containing the five process values read from the IO-Link master.

2. Implement the function block in ST:

```
FUNCTION_BLOCK IO_Link_Data_Acquisition
  VAR_INPUT
    IO_Link_Master_Address: DINT;
    IO_Link_Data_Request: BOOL;
    IO_Link_Data_Buffer: ARRAY[0..4] OF REAL;
  VAR_OUTPUT
    IO_Link_Data_Status: ARRAY[0..4] OF BOOL;
    IO_Link_Data_Values: ARRAY[0..4] OF REAL;
  VAR
    i: DINT;
    IO_Link_Connection: BOOL;
    IO_Link_Data_Received: BOOL;
    Timeout_Counter: TON;
    Timeout_Value: TIME;
    Error_Code: DINT;
  END_VAR

  IF IO_Link_Data_Request THEN
    IO_Link_Connection := IO_Link_Master_Connection(IO_Link_Master_Address);
    IF IO_Link_Connection THEN
      FOR i := 0 TO 4 DO
        Timeout_Counter := T#0;
        Timeout_Value := T#100ms;
        IO_Link_Data_Received := FALSE;
        REPEAT
          IF IO_Link_Master_Read_Data(IO_Link_Master_Address, i, IO_Link_Data_Buffer[i]) THEN
            IO_Link_Data_Received := TRUE;
            EXIT;
