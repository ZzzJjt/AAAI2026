### Intent:
**Intent Summary:**  
Develop an IEC 61131-3 Structured Text function block for cubic spline interpolation that efficiently precomputes coefficients, handles runtime evaluation, and ensures smooth curve fitting for industrial applications like motion control or signal processing, while addressing PLC memory and latency constraints.  

*(Focus: Modular spline interpolation, trade-offs, and industrial use cases.)*

### Prompt:
**Spline Interpolation:**

Develop a self-contained function block in IEC 61131-3 Structured Text to compute spline interpolation over a set of data points. Ensure that the function block is modular and efficient, with comments explaining the steps involved in constructing and evaluating the spline. Address potential computational challenges, such as memory usage and processing time, and discuss the advantages of spline interpolation in comparison to linear methods, particularly in applications where smooth curve fitting is essential.

**B-A-B:**

ðŸŸ¥ B (Before) â€“ The Challenge

In industrial automation and process control, interpolating between data points is a common requirement â€” whether for sensor calibration, lookup tables, or motion path generation. While linear interpolation is simple, it often leads to sharp transitions or discontinuities that are not suitable for applications requiring smooth curve fitting. Unfortunately, implementing spline interpolation on PLCs using IEC 61131-3 Structured Text can be complex due to limited memory, no native spline libraries, and real-time execution constraints.
