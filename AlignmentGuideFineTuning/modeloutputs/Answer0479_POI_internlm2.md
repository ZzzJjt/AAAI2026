### Intent:
**Intent Summary:**  
Develop a fail-safe IEC 61131-3 Structured Text program to enforce safety door interlocks for a chemical reactor, preventing startup or operation if any door is open and triggering emergency shutdowns with manual reset requirements.  

*(Focus: Safety compliance, door monitoring, reactor control, and emergency logic in PLC code.)*

### Prompt:
**Interlock Safety Doors:**

Develop a self-contained IEC 61131-3 Structured Text program to implement interlocks for safety doors in a chemical reactor. The program should monitor the status of the safety doors and ensure that the reactor remains in a safe state whenever any door is open.

The interlock logic should prevent the reactor from starting or continuing operation if any safety door is not securely closed. Additionally, if a safety door is opened during reactor operation, the program should immediately trigger an emergency shutdown sequence, including deactivating the reactor and stopping any hazardous processes.

This interlock ensures that the reactor only operates when all safety doors are securely closed, providing an essential safeguard against accidental exposure to hazardous conditions. Discuss the importance of safety door interlocks in preventing operator access to dangerous environments and ensuring compliance with safety standards in chemical processing.

**R-I-S-E:**

🟥 R (Role) – Your Role

You are a PLC programmer or safety system engineer responsible for implementing a door interlock system for a chemical reactor, ensuring that the reactor can only operate when all safety doors are securely closed.

⸻

🟩 I (Input) – What You’re Given

You need to design a Structured Text (IEC 61131-3) program that:
	•	Monitors the status of multiple safety doors (e.g., DOOR_1_CLOSED, DOOR_2_CLOSED, etc.)
	•	Prevents the reactor from starting if any door is open
	•	Shuts down the reactor immediately if a door opens during operation
	•	Includes a manual reset requirement after an emergency shutdown
	•	Handles all logic in a fail-safe manner to comply with chemical industry safety standards

⸻

🟧 S (Steps) – What You Need to Do
	1.	Define all variables such as door status inputs, reactor state, shutdown latch, and reset flag.
	2.	Write logic to prevent startup unless all doors are closed:

ALLOW_START := DOOR_1_CLOSED AND DOOR_2_CLOSED AND DOOR_3_CLOSED;
  3.	Write logic to initiate emergency shutdown if any door opens during operation:
  IF ReactorRunning AND (NOT DOOR_1_CLOSED OR NOT DOOR_2_CLOSED OR NOT DOOR_3_CLOSED) THEN
    EMERGENCY_SHUTDOWN := TRUE;
    ReactorRunning := FALSE;
END_IF;
  4.	Latch the shutdown and require a manual reset after all doors are closed again:
  IF EMERGENCY_SHUTDOWN AND ResetRequested AND AllDoorsClosed THEN
    EMERGENCY_SHUTDOWN := FALSE;
END_IF;
🟦 E (Expectation) – What Success Looks Like

You produce a self-contained interlock system that reliably enforces door safety requirements. The system:
	•	Prevents unsafe reactor startup
	•	Immediately shuts down hazardous processes if access is breached
	•	Ensures restart only after all safety doors are closed and manually reset
	•	Supports industry-standard safety compliance and minimizes the risk of operator injury or chemical exposure

**Additional Considerations:**

1.	**Safety Standards**: Ensure that your program complies with relevant safety standards, such as IEC 61508 (Functional Safety of Electrical/Electronic/Programmable Electronic Safety-related Systems) and IEC 61511 (Functional Safety - Safety Instrumented Systems for the Process Industry).
2.	**Fail-Safe Design**: Implement a fail-safe design to ensure that the system continues to operate correctly even in the presence of faults or errors. This may involve using redundant components, implementing fail-safe timers, or employing other techniques to ensure that the system remains in a safe state.
3.	**Maintenance and Testing**: Develop a maintenance and testing plan to ensure that the interlock system remains effective over time. This may include regular inspections, testing of safety doors, and verification of the program's logic and functionality.
4.	**Documentation**: Create clear and concise documentation that explains the interlock system's purpose, operation, and maintenance requirements. This documentation should be easily accessible to all relevant personnel, including operators, maintenance staff, and safety experts.
5.	**Training**: Provide training to all personnel who will be working with the interlock system. This training should cover the system's operation, potential hazards, and emergency procedures in case of a safety door breach.

By following these guidelines and best practices, you can develop a robust and reliable interlock system that ensures the safe operation of a chemical reactor and protects the health and well-being of all personnel involved.
