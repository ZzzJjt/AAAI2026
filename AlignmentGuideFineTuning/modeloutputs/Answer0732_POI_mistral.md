**Notes:**

1.	The Cooley-Tukey radix-2 FFT algorithm is a popular choice for real-time FFT computation due to its efficient use of memory and computational resources.
2.	Consider using twiddle factors to simplify the computation and reduce the number of multiplications required.
3.	For real-time suitability, ensure that the FFT computation can be completed within the scan time of the PLC control loop.
4.	Consider implementing a bit-reversal function to rearrange the input data for efficient computation in the FFT algorithm.
5.	Include diagnostic checks for input array size, numerical precision, and other potential issues that may arise during execution.
6.	Consider providing options for outputting either the magnitude spectrum or real and imaginary components, depending on the user's needs.
7.	Discuss practical use cases such as vibration diagnostics, motor frequency analysis, or filter design to demonstrate the value of the FFT function block in industrial applications.
8.	Consider the limitations of the FFT function block in terms of input size, numerical precision, and scan time impact, and provide guidance on how to optimize its use in real-world scenarios.

```structuredtext
-- FFT_Block Function Block
-- Input: InputSignal (ARRAY[1..64] OF REAL)

  var i, j, temp: INTEGER;
  i := n;
  j := 1;
  repeat
    while (i > j) do
      i := i div 2;
      j := j div 2;
    end_while;
    temp := i;
    i := i + j;
    i := i - j;
    j := temp;
  end_repeat;
  return j + 1;
