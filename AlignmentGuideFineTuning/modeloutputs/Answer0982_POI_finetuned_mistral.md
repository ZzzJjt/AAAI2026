â¸»

ðŸŸ© A (Action)
	â€¢	Define the process context: continuous neutralization of nitric acid with ammonia in a stirred reactor
	â€¢	Include concrete setpoints and ranges for critical parameters:
	â€¢	Temperature: 175â€¯Â°C Â± 2â€¯Â°C
	â€¢	Pressure: 4.8â€¯bar Â± 0.2â€¯bar
	â€¢	Ammonia-to-acid molar ratio: 1.01:1
	â€¢	pH range: 6.2 Â± 0.3
	â€¢	Specify the instrumentation and control elements:
	â€¢	TIC-101 (reactor temperature controller), PIC-102 (pressure), FIC-103/104 (flow control), AIC-105 (pH)
	â€¢	Outline the operating sequence:
	1.	Startup: Valve alignment, flow ramp-up, temperature control, pH stabilization
	2.	Normal operation: Maintain loop control with alarm monitoring
	3.	Shutdown: Stop feeds, isolate reactor, relieve pressure
	â€¢	Define interlocks and alarm logic:
	â€¢	Trip if pressure > 5.2 bar
	â€¢	Emergency shutdown if temperature > 185â€¯Â°C
	â€¢	Reduce ammonia feed if pH < 5.5

### Control Narrative for Beer Brewing Process

#### 1. Introduction
This control narrative describes the automation of the beer brewing process, which consists of six main stages: milling, mashing, lautering, boiling, fermentation, and conditioning. Each stage includes specific setpoints, instrumentation, and procedural logic to ensure consistent product quality and operational reliability. The narrative is designed to support PLC/DCS implementation and includes safety interlocks, alarm logic, and startup/shutdown procedures.

#### 2. Milling

##### 2.1 Setpoints and Instrumentation
- **Milling Duration**: 15 minutes
- **Milling Speed**: 100 RPM
- **Instrumentation**:
  - TIC-101: Temperature Controller (setpoint: 20Â°C)
  - PIC-102: Pressure Controller (setpoint: 0.5 bar)
  - FIC-103: Flow Controller (setpoint: 100 L/min)
  - AIC-104: Analog Input (grist temperature)
  - AIC-105: Analog Input (grist moisture)
  - EIC-106: Emergency Stop

##### 2.2 Procedural Logic
- **Startup**:
  1. Verify emergency stop is off (AIC-106 = 0).
  2. Set milling speed to 100 RPM.
  3. Start milling.
  4. Monitor temperature and moisture levels.
- **Normal Operation**:
  1. Maintain temperature at 20Â°C.
  2. Maintain moisture level below 10%.
  3. Monitor for abnormal conditions:
    - Temperature > 22Â°C: trigger alarm, reduce speed.
    - Moisture > 12%: trigger alarm, reduce speed.
    - Emergency stop activated: stop milling, set milling speed to 0.
- **Shutdown**:
  1. Stop milling.
  2. Set milling speed to 0.
  3. Disable flow and pressure control.

#### 3. Mashing
