### Intent:
**Intent Summary:**  
Develop an ISA-88-compliant batch control program in Structured Text for PVC production, automating reactor stages (polymerize, decover, dry) with modular methods (e.g., `EvacuateReactor`, `AddDemineralizedWater`) while ensuring precise temperature/pressure control and scalability.  

*(Focus: Sequential control, parameterized phases, and industrial scalability.)*

### Prompt:
**Batch PVC:**

Develop a self-contained program in IEC 61131-3 Structured Text for the sequential control of a reactor in the batch production of polyvinylchloride (PVC) via polymerization of vinyl chloride monomers. The program should follow an ISA-88 control recipe structure and include the following process stages: polymerize, decover, and dry. Each stage should consist of ordered operations, including preparing the reactor by evacuating it to remove oxygen, charging the reactor with demineralized water and surfactants, and reacting by adding vinyl chloride monomer and catalyst while controlling the temperature between 55-60Â°C until the pressure decreases.

Provide detailed content for key methods such as EvacuateReactor, which should handle the removal of oxygen, and AddDemineralizedWater, ensuring precise process parameters and timers are integrated. Additionally, discuss the application of ISA-88 principles in structuring the control recipe and the challenges involved in scaling the recipe for industrial use.

ðŸŸ¥ R (Role) â€“ Define Your Role

Act as a batch automation engineer specializing in ISA-88-compliant process control systems using IEC 61131-3 Structured Text.

ðŸŸ© I (Input) â€“ Information Provided

You are tasked with developing a batch control program for the production of polyvinylchloride (PVC) via polymerization of vinyl chloride monomers (VCM). The process involves a reactor and includes multiple stages:
	â€¢	Polymerize (with evacuation, charging, and controlled reaction),
	â€¢	Decover, and
	â€¢	Dry.
Key steps include removing oxygen, adding demineralized water and surfactants, and controlling temperature between 55â€“60Â°C until pressure drops. The control logic should be modular and structured according to ISA-88 standards, with reusable methods like EvacuateReactor and AddDemineralizedWater.

ðŸŸ§ S (Steps) â€“ Steps to Perform
	1.	Define the ISA-88 recipe structure, breaking down each stage into phases and operations.
	2.	Implement self-contained Structured Text logic for the Polymerize, Decover, and Dry stages.
	3.	Develop method blocks such as EvacuateReactor (with pressure monitoring and timeout logic) and AddDemineralizedWater (with volume and duration control).
	4.	Use timers, temperature and pressure setpoints, and transition conditions to sequence operations safely and efficiently.
	5.	Ensure modularity to support testing, validation, and future scaling.

ðŸŸ¦ E (Expectation) â€“ Expected Outcome

Deliver a modular, ISA-88-compliant Structured Text program capable of executing all stages of the PVC batch process with precision and clarity. The system should support safe phase transitions, real-time monitoring, and be scalable to larger reactors or higher production volumes without redesigning the control logic.
