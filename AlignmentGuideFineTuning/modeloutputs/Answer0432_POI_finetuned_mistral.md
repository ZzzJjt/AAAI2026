### Intent:
**Intent Summary:**  
Develop an IEC 61131-3 Structured Text function block to monitor OPC UA, Modbus, and Profinet connections, trigger alarms on failures, and log detailed audit trail entries with error codes for real-time diagnostics.

### Prompt:
**Communication Monitoring for OPC UA, Modbus, and Profinet Using IEC 61131-3 Structured Text:**

Develop a function block in structured text (ST) as per IEC 61131-3 standards to monitor communication connections to an OPC UA server, Modbus server, and Profinet in a machine system. The function block should continuously check the connection status of each protocol, and if any connection fails, an alarm should be triggered. Additionally, when a connection is lost, an entry must be created in the audit trail, detailing the reason for the server being down along with the corresponding error code. Discuss the implementation logic for monitoring multiple protocols, error detection, and how to effectively manage and log communication failures for real-time monitoring and troubleshooting.

**R-I-S-E:**

ðŸŸ¥ R (Role) â€“ Your Role

Act as a control systems engineer developing IEC 61131-3 Structured Text (ST) function blocks for real-time communication monitoring in industrial automation systems.

ðŸŸ© I (Input) â€“ What Youâ€™re Given

You need to create a function block that monitors communication links to an OPC UA server, a Modbus server, and a Profinet device. The function block must detect connection failures, trigger alarms for each protocol independently, and generate audit trail entries that include error codes and reasons for the failure. It should operate cyclically and be capable of managing multiple protocol states simultaneously.

ðŸŸ§ S (Steps) â€“ What You Need to Do
	1.	Design a function block in Structured Text (ST) with input parameters for each protocolâ€™s connection state and error details.
	2.	Implement logic to detect status changes, timeouts, or communication faults.
	3.	When a failure is detected, raise an alarm (e.g., set a BOOL flag or output an error code) and log a detailed audit entry including timestamp, protocol type, error reason, and code.
	4.	Ensure that the function block handles each protocol independently and resets alarms or logs recovery if communication is restored.

ðŸŸ¦ E (Expectation) â€“ What Success Looks Like

The result should be a robust, reusable ST function block capable of continuously monitoring OPC UA, Modbus, and Profinet connections. It should trigger real-time alarms for any failures and provide accurate, timestamped audit trail entries to support fast diagnostics, improved uptime, and system-wide communication transparency.
