### Intent:
**Intent Summary:**  
Develop an IEC 61131-3 Structured Text function block to monitor OPC UA, Modbus, and Profinet connections, trigger alarms on failures, and log detailed audit trail entries with error codes for real-time diagnostics.

### Prompt:
**Communication Monitoring for OPC UA, Modbus, and Profinet Using IEC 61131-3 Structured Text:**

Develop a function block in structured text (ST) as per IEC 61131-3 standards to monitor communication connections to an OPC UA server, Modbus server, and Profinet in a machine system. The function block should continuously check the connection status of each protocol, and if any connection fails, an alarm should be triggered. Additionally, when a connection is lost, an entry must be created in the audit trail, detailing the reason for the server being down along with the corresponding error code. Discuss the implementation logic for monitoring multiple protocols, error detection, and how to effectively manage and log communication failures for real-time monitoring and troubleshooting.

**R-I-S-E:**

ðŸŸ¥ R (Role) â€“ Your Role

Act as a control systems engineer developing IEC 61131-3 Structured Text (ST) function blocks for real-time communication monitoring in industrial automation systems.

ðŸŸ© I (Input) â€“ What Youâ€™re Given

You need to create a function block that monitors communication links to an OPC UA server, a Modbus server, and a Profinet device. The function block must detect connection failures, trigger alarms for each protocol independently, and generate audit trail entries that include error codes and reasons for the failure. It should operate cyclically and be capable of managing multiple protocol states simultaneously.

ðŸŸ§ S (Steps) â€“ What You Need to Do
	1.	Design a function block in Structured Text (ST) with input parameters for each protocolâ€™s connection state and error details.
	2.	Implement logic to detect status changes, timeouts, or communication faults.
	3.	When a failure is detected, raise an alarm (e.g., set a BOOL flag or output an error code) and log a detailed audit entry including timestamp, protocol type, error reason, and code.
	4.	Ensure that the function block handles each protocol independently and resets alarms or logs recovery if communication is restored.

ðŸŸ¦ E (Expectation) â€“ What Success Looks Like

The result should be a robust, reusable ST function block capable of continuously monitoring OPC UA, Modbus, and Profinet connections. It should trigger real-time alarms for any failures and provide accurate, timestamped audit trail entries to support fast diagnostics, improved uptime, and system-wide communication transparency.

**T-A-G:**

ðŸŸ¥ T (Task) â€“ What You Need to Do

Develop a self-contained function block in IEC 61131-3 Structured Text to monitor communication connections to an OPC UA server, Modbus server, and Profinet device. The function block should continuously check the connection status of each protocol, trigger alarms if any connection fails, and log detailed audit trail entries with error codes when a server is down.

ðŸŸ© A (Action) â€“ How to Do It

	1.	Define the function block inputs:
	â€¢	OPC UA connection status
	â€¢	Modbus connection status
	â€¢	Profinet connection status
	â€¢	Enable input for audit trail logging
	2.	Implement logic to monitor each connection:
	â€¢	For OPC UA, check for server reachability and timeout detection
	â€¢	For Modbus, monitor connection status and request response
	â€¢	For Profinet, check network reachability and communication health
	3.	When a connection fails, set an alarm flag and log an entry in the audit trail:
	â€¢	Include the reason for the server being down (e.g., timeout, no response)
	â€¢	Assign an error code to the audit entry
	4.	Ensure that the function block is modular and reusable for different protocols
	5.	Implement error handling and reset logic for when connections are restored
	6.	Perform thorough testing to ensure reliable monitoring and accurate logging

ðŸŸ§ G (Goal) â€“ What Youâ€™re Aiming For

The goal is to create a function block that provides real-time communication monitoring for OPC UA, Modbus, and Profinet, with the ability to trigger alarms and log detailed audit trail entries for troubleshooting and compliance. The function block should be designed to handle multiple protocols, detect failures, and provide actionable insights for maintaining system integrity.
