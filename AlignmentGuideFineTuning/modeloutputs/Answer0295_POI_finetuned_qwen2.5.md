### Intent:
**Intent Summary:**  
Develop an IEC 61131-3 Structured Text program to automatically detect and eject empty bottles from a packaging line using proximity sensors and a timed pneumatic cylinder, while logging events and ensuring continuous conveyor operation.  

*(Key focus: Sensor-triggered ejection, timer control, and diagnostic logging for empty bottle removal.)*

### Prompt:
**Empty Bottle Removal for Packaging Line Using 61131-3 Structured Text:**

Write a self-contained 61131-3 structured text (ST) program to automate the removal of empty bottles in a packaging line. After bottles are filled, they are transported by a conveyor toward the packaging station. The system includes two proximity sensors: one detects the presence of any bottle, and the second detects only empty bottles. When an empty bottle is detected, a pneumatic cylinder is activated to remove the empty bottle from the conveyor before it reaches the packaging area.

Ensure that the program controls the conveyor and cylinder operations efficiently, preventing any empty bottles from continuing to the packaging process, while maintaining smooth operation for filled bottles.

**C-A-R-E:**

ðŸŸ¥ C (Context) â€“ The Background

In a packaging line, itâ€™s essential to ensure that only filled bottles proceed to the packaging station. Any empty bottles that slip through can cause product defects, waste materials, or disrupt the downstream packaging process. To automate this task, a PLC-based system using IEC 61131-3 Structured Text (ST) can manage the removal of empty bottles using proximity sensors and a pneumatic ejector.

ðŸŸ© A (Action) â€“ The Implementation Task

Develop a self-contained Structured Text program that automates the removal of empty bottles using:
	â€¢	Two proximity sensors:
	â€¢	BottlePresentSensor: detects the presence of a bottle
	â€¢	EmptyBottleSensor: detects whether the bottle is empty
	â€¢	One pneumatic cylinder:
	â€¢	EjectCylinder: pushes empty bottles off the conveyor
	â€¢	One conveyor motor:
	â€¢	ConveyorMotor: keeps bottles moving toward the packaging station

Operational Logic:
	â€¢	The conveyor runs continuously.
	â€¢	If both sensors detect an empty bottle, activate the ejector for a brief time (e.g., 0.5 seconds).
	â€¢	Filled bottles continue through the line uninterrupted.
	â€¢	Use a timer to ensure the cylinder retracts after each ejection.

ðŸŸ¨ R (Result) â€“ The Expected Outcome

The result is a real-time, efficient control system that:
	â€¢	Removes only empty bottles, avoiding disruptions in the packaging process
	â€¢	Ensures filled bottles proceed smoothly, improving production throughput
	â€¢	Uses a timer-based ejector pulse, avoiding mechanical wear from constant actuation
	â€¢	Provides a scalable and modifiable control foundation for future enhancements (e.g., alarm logic or reject counters)

ðŸŸ¦ E (Example) â€“ A Practical Code Snippet

VAR
    BottlePresentSensor : BOOL;
    EmptyBottleSensor : BOOL;
    ConveyorMotor : BOOL := TRUE; // Always running
    EjectCylinder : BOOL;
    EjectTimer : TON;
END_VAR

// Eject logic for empty bottles
IF BottlePresentSensor AND EmptyBottleSensor THEN
    EjectTimer(IN := TRUE, PT := T#500ms); // Activate ejector for 0.5s
    EjectCylinder := TRUE;
ELSE
    EjectTimer(IN := FALSE);
    IF NOT EjectTimer.Q THEN
        EjectCylinder := FALSE;

ðŸŸ¥ B (Before) â€“ The Challenge

In a packaging line, empty bottles can cause downstream issues such as sensor misreads, product damage, or packaging errors. Without automated removal, these empty bottles may contaminate the packaging process or result in product waste.

ðŸŸ© A (After) â€“ The Desired Outcome

	â€¢	Operate the conveyor belt to transport bottles toward the packaging area
	â€¢	Use one sensor to detect the presence of any bottle and a second sensor to detect only empty bottles
	â€¢	When an empty bottle is detected, trigger a pneumatic cylinder to remove it from the conveyor
	â€¢	Ensure that filled bottles continue uninterrupted to the packaging process
	â€¢	Implement a timer to control the ejection duration, preventing continuous activation of the cylinder

	â€¢	Ensure that the program is structured for clarity and maintainability, with appropriate use of data types, variables, and control structures
	â€¢	Implement safety checks to prevent the ejection of filled bottles or the activation of the cylinder when no bottles are present
	â€¢	Provide a complete list of required inputs and outputs, including sensor signals, actuator control, and diagnostic logging
	â€¢	Include a discussion of the systemâ€™s performance metrics, such as ejection speed, conveyor speed, and sensor response time
	â€¢	Outline the integration strategy for the program within the packaging lineâ€™s control architecture
	â€¢	Provide a detailed explanation of the programâ€™s operation, including the role of each sensor and actuator, and the timing and control logic for empty bottle removal
