**Control Narrative for Ethanol Production**

**1. Introduction**

This control narrative describes the control logic and setpoints for the fermentation process in an ethanol production facility. The fermentation process is the second step in the production of ethanol from corn, following the milling and liquefaction steps. The fermentation process converts the sugars in the liquefied corn mash into ethanol and carbon dioxide.

The fermentation process is controlled using a combination of automation and manual intervention. The control system monitors and adjusts key process parameters such as temperature, pH, and agitation speed to ensure optimal conditions for the yeast to convert the sugars into ethanol. The control system also monitors the concentration of ethanol in the fermentation tanks and controls the flow of ethanol into the distillation process.

The control narrative is organized into the following sections:

Section 2: Milling and Liquefaction
Section 3: Fermentation
Section 4: Distillation
Section 5: Denaturing and Blending
Section 6: Packaging and Shipping

**2. Milling and Liquefaction**

The milling and liquefaction process is the first step in the production of ethanol from corn. The process involves grinding the corn into a fine powder and then mixing it with water and enzymes to break down the starch into simple sugars. The resulting mixture is called mash and is then pumped to the fermentation tanks.

The control system for the milling and liquefaction process is responsible for monitoring and controlling the following parameters:

Corn flow rate: The control system monitors the flow rate of corn into the grinder and adjusts it to maintain a consistent feed rate.

Grinder speed: The control system monitors the speed of the grinder and adjusts it to maintain a consistent grind size.

Mash temperature: The control system monitors the temperature of the mash and adjusts it to maintain a consistent temperature for the enzymes to work effectively.

Mash pH: The control system monitors the pH of the mash and adjusts it to maintain a neutral pH for the enzymes to work effectively.

The control system also monitors the concentration of enzymes in the mash and adjusts the flow rate of enzymes to maintain a consistent concentration.

**3. Fermentation**

The fermentation process is the second step in the production of ethanol from corn. The process involves adding yeast to the mash and allowing it to convert the sugars into ethanol and carbon dioxide. The fermentation process is controlled using a combination of automation and manual intervention. The control system monitors and adjusts key process parameters such as temperature, pH, and agitation speed to ensure optimal conditions for the yeast to convert the sugars into ethanol
