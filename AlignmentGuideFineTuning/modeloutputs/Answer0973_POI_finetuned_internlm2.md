### Intent:
The task is to create a configurable digital counter function block in IEC 61131-3 Structured Text that handles up/down counting with adjustable step size, bounds checking, reset capability, and edge detection for industrial automation applications.

### Prompt:
**DecToHex:**
Implement a self-contained function block in IEC 61131-3 structured text to convert a 10-digit decimal value to hexadecimal. Ensure proper handling of large values and edge cases.

**T-A-G:**

ðŸŸ¥ T (Task)

Create a function block in IEC 61131-3 Structured Text that converts a 10-digit decimal value into its hexadecimal representation.

â¸»

ðŸŸ© A (Action)
	â€¢	Define inputs and outputs:
	â€¢	Input: DecValue : LINT
	â€¢	Output: HexString : STRING
	â€¢	Use a loop-based algorithm to:
	â€¢	Repeatedly divide the decimal number by 16
	â€¢	Map each remainder to its corresponding hexadecimal digit (0â€“F)
	â€¢	Construct the hex string in reverse order, then output the result
	â€¢	Implement edge case handling, such as:
	â€¢	Input = 0 â†’ Output = '0'
	â€¢	Large number limits â†’ safe type casting and bounds checking
	â€¢	Add clear comments and use internal variables for modularity and clarity

ðŸŸ¦ G (Goal)

Deliver a robust, reusable, and scan-cycle-safe function block that reliably converts large decimal values to hexadecimal. The block should support integration with diagnostics, HMI displays, and protocol encoders, while handling all typical boundary conditions safely and efficiently.

Deliver a robust, reusable, and scan-cycle-safe function block that reliably converts large decimal values to hexadecimal. The block should support integration with diagnostics, HMI displays, and protocol encoders, while handling all typical boundary conditions safely and efficiently. Ensure that the code is self-contained, with no external dependencies, and that it adheres to the IEC 61131-3 Structured Text syntax and conventions.

ðŸŸª M (Method)

Create a self-contained function block in IEC 61131-3 Structured Text to convert a 10-digit decimal value to hexadecimal. The function block should handle large decimal values and edge cases, such as input values of 0 and large numbers. Use a loop-based algorithm to divide the decimal number by 16, mapping each remainder to its corresponding hexadecimal digit (0â€“F). Construct the hex string in reverse order and output the result. Ensure that the code is modular, with clear comments and internal variables, and that it adheres to the IEC 61131-3 Structured Text syntax and conventions.

**R:**

ðŸŸ¥ R (Result)

Here is a self-contained function block in IEC 61131-3 Structured Text to convert a 10-digit decimal value to hexadecimal:

```struct
	DecToHex : SUBROUTINE;
	
	DecValue : LINT;
	HexString : STRING[5];
	
	DecToHex(DecValue, HexString) :=
	begin
		DecValue := 1234567890;	// Replace with your decimal value
		HexString := '';
		
		for I := 1 to 2 do
		begin
			// Calculate the remainder of the division by 16
			Remainder := DecValue mod 16;
			
			// Convert the remainder to its hexadecimal digit
			if Remainder = 0 then
				HexString := '0' + HexString
			else if Remainder = 1 then
				HexString := '1' + HexString
			else if Remainder = 2 then
				HexString := '2' + HexString
			else if Remainder = 3 then
				HexString := '3' + HexString
			else if Remainder = 4 then
				HexString := '4' + HexString
			else if Remainder = 5 then
				HexString := '5' + HexString
			else if Remainder = 6 then
				HexString := '6' + HexString
