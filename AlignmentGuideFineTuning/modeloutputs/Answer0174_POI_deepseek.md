### Intent:
**Intent Summary:**  
Create a reusable IEC 61131-3 structured text function block to convert Fahrenheit to Celsius with input validation, ensuring accuracy and safety for industrial automation applications.  

*(Focus: Standardized conversion, input checks, and modularity for PLC environments.)*

### Prompt:
**Fahrenheit to Celsius:**
Implement a self-contained function block in IEC 61131-3 structured text to convert Fahrenheit to Celsius. Ensure it handles input validation and provides accurate results.


**B-A-B:**

ðŸŸ¥ B (Before) â€“ The Problem or Challenge

In industrial automation systems, especially those involving HVAC, thermal processing, or sensor integration, temperature values may be provided in Fahrenheit while the control logic or displays require Celsius. Without a standardized, reusable function block, engineers may repeatedly rewrite conversion logic or risk incorrect scaling, lack of input validation, or inconsistent formatting across projects.

ðŸŸ© A (After) â€“ The Desired Outcome

Create a self-contained function block in IEC 61131-3 Structured Text that converts a given Fahrenheit temperature to Celsius. The function should:
	â€¢	Use the formula:
C = (F - 32) \times \frac{5}{9}
	â€¢	Accept a REAL or LREAL Fahrenheit input
	â€¢	Provide a validated, accurate Celsius output
	â€¢	Include input validation (e.g., to reject unphysical inputs like below absolute zero)
	â€¢	Be reusable, modular, and safe for use in scan-cycle environments

â¸»

ðŸŸ§ B (Bridge) â€“ How to Get There
	1.	Define the function block with:
	â€¢	Fahrenheit : REAL (input)
	â€¢	Celsius : REAL (output)
	â€¢	ValidInput : BOOL (output flag)
	2.	Add logic to:
	â€¢	Validate that the Fahrenheit input is above -459.67Â°F (absolute zero)
	â€¢	Perform the conversion using precise floating-point arithmetic
	3.	Include comments and documentation for readability and maintainability
	4.	Optionally, set Celsius to 0 and ValidInput to FALSE if the input is invalid

ðŸŸ¨ B-A-B (Bridge-to-Actionable) â€“ The Action Plan

1.	Review existing function blocks and identify any similar conversion logic
2.	Refactor and consolidate the conversion logic into a reusable function block
3.	Test the function block with various input values, ensuring accurate and consistent results
4.	Document the function block and its usage
5.	Integrate the function block into a test project or existing project
6.	Ensure the function block is modular and can be easily integrated into other function blocks or projects
7.	Share the function block with the team and document the process for future reference
