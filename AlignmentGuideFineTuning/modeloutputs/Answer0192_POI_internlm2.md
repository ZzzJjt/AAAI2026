### Intent:
**Intent Summary:**  
Create a detailed control narrative for an ammonium nitrate reactor, specifying setpoints, instrumentation, and control logic to ensure safe and efficient operation, including temperature, pressure, flow ratio, and pH regulation with interlocks for deviations.  

*(For code generation: Focus on translating defined setpoints, PID loops, and safety interlocks into programmable logic for reactor automation.)*

### Prompt:
**Control Narrative for Ammonium Nitrate Reactor**

Create a control narrative for a reactor producing ammonium nitrates including concrete setpoints and ranges.

**B-A-B:**

ðŸŸ¥ B (Before) â€“ The Problem or Challenge

In the production of ammonium nitrate, the reactor stage is critical for maintaining safety, product quality, and process efficiency. However, without a clearly defined control narrativeâ€”including setpoints, ranges, and instrumentationâ€”operators and control systems risk process instability, inefficient reactions, or unsafe operating conditions. Generic documentation often lacks the precision needed for automation or regulatory compliance.

ðŸŸ© A (After) â€“ The Desired Outcome

Develop a comprehensive control narrative for the ammonium nitrate reactor, including:
	â€¢	Concrete setpoints and control ranges for key parameters such as:
	â€¢	Reaction temperature (e.g., 170â€“180â€¯Â°C)
	â€¢	Reactor pressure (e.g., 4.5â€“5.0â€¯bar)
	â€¢	Ammonia-to-nitric acid ratio
	â€¢	pH control
	â€¢	Identification of critical instrumentation: temperature sensors, pressure transmitters, flow meters, pH analyzers
	â€¢	Description of control logic and interlocks for normal operation and safety shutdowns

â¸»

ðŸŸ§ B (Bridge) â€“ How to Get There
	1.	Define the process overview:
	â€¢	Neutralization of nitric acid with ammonia in a continuous stirred-tank reactor (CSTR)
	2.	List key control loops and their setpoints:
	â€¢	Temperature control loop: TIC-101 setpoint = 175â€¯Â°C Â± 2â€¯Â°C
	â€¢	Pressure control loop: PIC-102 = 4.8â€¯bar Â± 0.2â€¯bar
	â€¢	Flow ratio control: Ammonia:Acid = 1.01:1
	â€¢	pH control loop: target = 6.0â€“6.5
	3.	Add equipment and instrumentation references (e.g., FIC-103 for ammonia feed, LSH-104 for high-level interlock)
	4.	Detail startup and normal operation sequence, followed by shutdown logic triggered by deviations from pressure, temperature, or flow

### Generated Code:

	5.	Identify safety interlocks and their actions:
	â€¢	High-pressure interlock: shutdown reactor and open relief valve
	â€¢	Low-temperature interlock: reduce ammonia feed and increase heat input
	â€¢	High-flow ratio interlock: reduce ammonia feed and increase nitric acid feed
	6.	Ensure interlocks are programmable and can be overridden by operators in emergency situations
	7.	Document control logic and interlocks in a clear, standardized format for automation and regulatory compliance

**Control Narrative Summary:**

The control narrative for the ammonium nitrate reactor includes:
	â€¢	Concrete setpoints and control ranges for temperature, pressure, flow ratio, and pH
	â€¢	Identification of critical instrumentation
	â€¢	Description of control logic and interlocks for normal operation and safety shutdowns
	â€¢	Programmable interlocks that can be overridden in emergencies
	â€¢	Clear, standardized documentation for automation and regulatory compliance

By following this control narrative, the ammonium nitrate reactor can operate safely, efficiently, and within regulatory guidelines, ensuring a consistent and high-quality product.
