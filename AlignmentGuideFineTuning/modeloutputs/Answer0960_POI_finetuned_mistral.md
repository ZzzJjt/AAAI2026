### Control System Design for Steam Generator Startup

#### 1. Overview
The steam generator in a power plant is a complex non-linear system with key variables such as pressure, temperature, and flow rate. The startup process involves heating the system, reaching critical pressure, and ramping up flow to generate steam. A non-linear model predictive controller (NMPC) is proposed to optimize the startup process by minimizing time while maintaining safety and operational constraints.

#### 2. System Description
The steam generator is modeled using a system of ordinary differential equations (ODEs) or a data-driven surrogate model. The NMPC is designed to predict the systemâ€™s future behavior and adjust control inputs to meet startup objectives.

#### 3. Control Objectives
- **Objective 1**: Minimize startup time while maintaining safety and operational constraints.
- **Objective 2**: Ensure the system reaches steady-state conditions (e.g., 520Â°C, 30 bar, 100% flow) safely and efficiently.

#### 4. Control Strategy
- **Prediction Model**: Use a surrogate model or ODEs to simulate the steam generatorâ€™s behavior.
- **Optimization Loop**:
  - **Prediction Horizon**: 10â€“20 steps (e.g., 10 minutes).
  - **Control Horizon**: 2â€“3 steps (e.g., 2 minutes).
  - **Optimization Algorithm**: Use CasADi, GEKKO, or Pyomo to solve the NMPC optimization problem.
- **Constraints**:
  - **Temperature**: 200Â°C â‰¤ T â‰¤ 520Â°C.
  - **Pressure**: 10 bar â‰¤ P â‰¤ 30 bar.
  - **Flow Rate**: 0% â‰¤ Q â‰¤ 100% (maximum capacity).
  - **Heating Input**: 0 â‰¤ U â‰¤ 100% (maximum heating power).

#### 5. Implementation
- **Step 1**: Develop the surrogate model or ODEs to represent the steam generatorâ€™s dynamics.
- **Step 2**: Implement the NMPC optimization loop using CasADi
