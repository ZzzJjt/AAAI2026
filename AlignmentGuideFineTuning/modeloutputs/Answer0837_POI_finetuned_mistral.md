### Intent:
**Intent Summary:**  
Create a reusable IEC 61131-3 function block (in Structured Text) that encapsulates a C-based OPC UA client for PLCs, enabling secure server communication with configurable timeouts and robust error handling via standardized input/output interfaces.  

*(Focus: Integration of OPC UA client functionality into PLC environments with industrial reliability.)*

### Prompt:
**OPC UA Client Implementation Using C and IEC 61131-3 Structured Text:**

Develop C-code for an OPC UA client, then wrap it into an IEC 61131-based function block written in structured text (ST). The function block should have the following input pins: Execute (type: BOOL), ServerUrl (type: STRING[255]), and Timeout (type: TIME). The output pins should include Done (type: BOOL), Busy (type: BOOL), Error (type: BOOL), and ErrorID (type: DWORD). In your explanation, describe how the C-code interfaces with the OPC UA server, how the function block manages communication with the server, and how error handling is implemented. Provide details on how to integrate this function block within an IEC 61131-3 environment for reliable client-server communication.

ðŸŸ¥ T (Task) â€“ What You Need to Do

Create a C-based OPC UA client and wrap it into an IEC 61131-3 Structured Text (ST) function block for use in a PLC environment.

â¸»

ðŸŸ© A (Action) â€“ How to Do It

Implement the OPC UA client in C using a standard library such as open62541. The client should establish connections, manage sessions, and handle error conditions. Then, expose this functionality through a Structured Text function block with the following interface:

Inputs:
	â€¢	Execute (BOOL): Triggers the connection
	â€¢	ServerUrl (STRING[255]): Specifies the OPC UA server
	â€¢	Timeout (TIME): Sets the connection timeout

Outputs:
	â€¢	Done (BOOL): Set when the operation completes successfully
	â€¢	Busy (BOOL): Indicates ongoing operation
	â€¢	Error (BOOL): Flags a failure
	â€¢	ErrorID (DWORD): Provides detailed error information

Ensure the function block handles rising-edge detection on Execute, maintains internal state for communication control, and maps C function return values to appropriate PLC outputs.

â¸»

ðŸŸ¦ G (Goal) â€“ What You Want to Achieve

Provide a reusable, PLC-friendly function block that allows seamless and reliable OPC UA client communication from within an IEC 61131-3 environment. This enhances the systemâ€™s ability to exchange data with external OPC UA servers while offering robust status monitoring and error reporting for industrial-grade reliability.
