### Intent:
**Intent Summary:**  
Design a structured start-up and shutdown sequence in IEC 61131-3 Structured Text for a 3D pouch making machine, ensuring synchronized activation/deactivation of heating/cooling stations, precise cutter timing, and critical winding tension control via feeder units, with safety interlocks and parameterized timers.

### Prompt:
**3D Pouch Making Machine:**

Design a detailed start-up and shutdown sequence for a 3D pouch making machine in IEC 61131-3 Structured Text. The machine consists of 8 heating stations, 8 cooling stations, one horizontal cutter, one vertical cutter, and two feeder units responsible for raw material feeding. Winding tension management is critical throughout the process to ensure proper tension in the raw material.

Write a structured start-up sequence that sequentially activates the heating and cooling stations, regulates the feeder units to maintain optimal tension, and ensures proper synchronization between the cutters and material flow. Additionally, create a shutdown sequence that safely deactivates each component in the correct order, ensuring proper cooling and tension release.

Ensure the program includes typical parameter values, timers, and conditions for each stage of the start-up and shutdown procedures, and discuss the importance of winding tension in maintaining machine efficiency and product quality.

**Winding Tension Management:**

Winding tension management is crucial in the 3D pouch making process to ensure the raw material maintains its shape and integrity throughout the process. Proper tension control helps prevent material deformation, misalignment, and breakage, which can lead to reduced machine efficiency, increased downtime, and lower product quality.

By regulating the tension in the feeder units, the machine can maintain a consistent tension level throughout the process, ensuring that the final product is uniform and free of defects. This is achieved by adjusting the speed of the feeder units based on the material's properties, such as thickness, elasticity, and moisture content.

In addition, proper tension control helps minimize the risk of material snapping or tearing during the cutting and winding stages, which can lead to costly repairs and production delays. By gradually releasing the tension during the shutdown sequence, the machine can ensure a smooth and controlled process, reducing the likelihood of material damage and improving overall machine performance.
