### Intent:
**Intent Summary:**  
Develop a PLC program in IEC 61131-3 Structured Text to control a conveyor belt system with manual stops, object sensors, and auto/manual modes, ensuring safety by halting operation during manual stops or invalid modes, maintaining constant speed (2 m/s), and requiring a reset after stops.  

*(Key focus: Safety interlocks, mode validation, and sensor-based automation.)*

### Prompt:
**Automatic Car Wash Station Control Using 61131-3 Structured Text:**

Write a PLC program in structured text (ST) according to IEC 61131-3 standards to control an automatic car wash station with a single wash bay. The system should use a sensor to detect the presence of a car. Once the car is detected and no human is present in the wash area, the system should initiate the car wash process. If a human is detected within the car wash area at any point, the station should immediately stop the wash process, trigger an alarm, and remain in a safe state until the area is clear.

**T-A-G:**

ðŸŸ¥ T (Task) â€“ What You Need to Do

Develop a PLC control program in IEC 61131-3 Structured Text (ST) for managing a single-bay automatic car wash station. The system must ensure safe and autonomous operation, responding to both car and human presence in the wash area.

ðŸŸ© A (Action) â€“ How to Do It
	1.	Use the following input signals:
	â€¢	CarPresentSensor : BOOL â€” detects a car in the wash bay
	â€¢	HumanDetectedSensor : BOOL â€” detects a person in the wash zone
	2.	Control the following outputs:
	â€¢	WashActive : BOOL â€” starts/stops the wash process
	â€¢	AlarmActive : BOOL â€” activates when a person is detected during wash
	â€¢	SafeToRun : BOOL â€” internal flag that governs when a wash can safely begin
	3.	Implement the logic:
	â€¢	If a human is detected, stop the wash, set AlarmActive := TRUE, and set SafeToRun := FALSE
	â€¢	If a car is detected, no human is present, and the system is safe, start the wash (WashActive := TRUE)
	â€¢	Once the area is clear and wash is stopped, reset the system (SafeToRun := TRUE) to allow new cycles
	4.	Example Structured Text snippet:
 CarPresent := CarPresentSensor;
HumanDetected := HumanDetectedSensor;

IF HumanDetected THEN
    WashActive := FALSE;
    AlarmActive := TRUE;
    SafeToRun := FALSE;
ELSIF CarPresent AND NOT HumanDetected AND SafeToRun THEN
    WashActive := TRUE;
    AlarmActive := FALSE;
END_IF;

IF NOT HumanDetected AND NOT WashActive THEN
    SafeToRun := TRUE;
END_IF;
5.	Document the logic:
	â€¢	Explain interlock behavior and human override handling
	â€¢	Include comments for safe state restoration and alarm reset behavior
	â€¢	Ensure all transitions are clear and scan-time safe

â¸»

ðŸŸ¦ G (Goal) â€“ What You Want to Achieve

Deliver a safe, reliable, and standards-compliant control logic solution that:
	â€¢	Automatically starts the wash cycle when conditions are safe
	â€¢	Immediately stops and locks out the process if a human enters the zone
	â€¢	Prevents automatic restart after a human interruption
	â€¢	Is clear, modular, and ready for integration with alarms, HMIs, or extended logic like multi-stage wash cycles
