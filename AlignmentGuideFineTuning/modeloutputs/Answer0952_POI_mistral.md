**Batch Paper Machine Press Section:**

Design an ISA-88-compliant Structured Text program to automate the sequenced startup of a paper machine press section. The program should manage the following operations:

1. Speed ramping
2. Temperature regulation
3. Pressure control
4. Synchronization

Include fault handling and safety checks to ensure the system operates safely and efficiently.

**Speed Ramping:**

Develop a method for speed ramping in the paper machine press section, using a linear ramping approach. Define the initial speed, final speed, ramping time, and acceleration/deceleration rates as program variables. Implement a timer-based control loop to adjust the motor speed according to the ramping function, ensuring smooth and controlled transitions between speeds.

**Temperature Regulation:**

Create a method for temperature regulation in the paper machine press section, using a PID controller. Define the setpoint, process variable, proportional gain, integral gain, and derivative gain as program variables. Implement a timer-based control loop to calculate the output signal based on the PID equation, and use this signal to control the heater or cooler as needed. Include a deadband to prevent oscillations and improve stability.

**Pressure Control:**

Develop a method for pressure control in the paper machine press section, using a PI controller. Define the setpoint, process variable, proportional gain, and integral gain as program variables. Implement a timer-based control loop to calculate the output signal based on the PI equation, and use this signal to control the valve position as needed. Include a deadband to prevent oscillations and improve stability.

**Synchronization:**

Create a method for synchronizing the paper machine press section with other equipment, using a timer-based approach. Define the synchronization points and tolerances as program variables. Implement a timer-based control loop to monitor the position and speed of the press section, and trigger alarms or halt the process if synchronization is not achieved within the specified tolerances.

**Fault Handling and Safety Checks:**

Include fault handling and safety checks in the program to ensure the system operates safely and efficiently. Implement conditional checks for critical process variables, such as temperature, pressure, and speed, and trigger alarms or halt the process if any abnormal conditions are detected
