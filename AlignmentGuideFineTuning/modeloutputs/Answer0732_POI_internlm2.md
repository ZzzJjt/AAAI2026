// Output: MagnitudeSpectrum (ARRAY[1..32] OF REAL)
//         RealPart (ARRAY[1..32] OF REAL)
//         ImaginaryPart (ARRAY[1..32] OF REAL)

// Step 1: Bit-reversal permutation
// Step 2: Cooley-Tukey radix-2 FFT
// Step 3: Twiddle factor application
// Step 4: Output magnitude spectrum or real/imaginary components

// Implementation details...

```

**Write-up:**

The FFT_Block function block efficiently computes the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) of a given input array using the Cooley-Tukey radix-2 method. This algorithm divides the input array into smaller subarrays, recursively computes the FFT of each subarray, and combines the results to obtain the final FFT.

The implementation is optimized for memory and processing constraints of industrial PLCs by using fixed input sizes (e.g., 64 samples) and deterministic execution time. The function block handles fixed input sizes by performing bit-reversal permutation to ensure that the input array is in the correct order for the FFT algorithm. In case of input issues, such as array size mismatches or invalid data, the function block includes fallback or diagnostic behavior to handle these cases gracefully.

The FFT_Block function block has limitations regarding input size, numerical precision, and scan time impact. The fixed input size of 64 samples may not be suitable for all applications, and increasing the size may require more memory and processing power. Additionally, the numerical precision of the input data and the computed FFT results may be limited by the floating-point representation used by the PLC. Finally, the scan time of the function block may impact the real-time performance of the control loop, especially if the FFT computation is performed frequently.
