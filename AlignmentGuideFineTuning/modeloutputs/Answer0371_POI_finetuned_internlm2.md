### Intent:
The task is to create a self-contained, input-validated binary search function block in IEC 61131-3 Structured Text for efficiently locating values in sorted arrays within industrial PLC applications.

### Prompt:
**Binary Search:**
Implement a self-contained function block in IEC 61131-3 structured text to perform a binary search on an array of 100 integers. Include input validation and efficient handling of search boundaries.

**C-A-R-E:**

🟥 C (Context) – Background Situation

In industrial automation systems, it’s common to work with arrays of sensor readings, setpoints, or index values. Efficient data retrieval is essential, especially when scanning large arrays. A binary search algorithm is optimal for sorted integer arrays, offering logarithmic-time performance compared to linear search. Implementing such logic in IEC 61131-3 Structured Text allows for modular, real-time lookup operations on PLCs.

🟩 A (Action) – Task to Perform

Create a self-contained function block in Structured Text to perform a binary search on an array of 100 integers. Your implementation should:
	•	Take as input a sorted array, the target value, and an enable flag
	•	Use Low, High, and Mid pointers to narrow the search space
	•	Validate input conditions such as array bounds and search preconditions
	•	Handle edge cases like an empty range or out-of-bounds indices
	•	Output the index of the found value (or -1 if not found), and a boolean flag indicating success

⸻

🟨 R (Result) – Expected Outcome

The result should be a modular, reliable, and reusable binary search function block that runs efficiently on PLC hardware. It should minimize scan time for data lookups and be easily integrated into structured control applications that require high-speed decision-making or condition detection.

🟦 E (Example) – Concrete Illustration

Here’s an excerpt of what the Structured Text logic might look like:

IF Enable THEN
   Low := 1;
   High := 100;
   Found := FALSE;

   WHILE (Low <= High) AND NOT Found DO
      Mid := (Low + High) / 2;
      IF SearchArray[Mid] = TargetValue THEN
         Index := Mid;
         Found := TRUE;
      ELSIF SearchArray[Mid] > TargetValue THEN
         High := Mid - 1;
      ELSE
         Low := Mid + 1;
      END_IF;
   END_WHILE;

   IF NOT Found THEN
      Index := -1;
   END_IF;
END_IF;

🟪 I (Implication) – The So What? Factor

By implementing a self-contained binary search function block in IEC 61131-3 Structured Text, you ensure that your PLC code is modular, efficient, and easy to integrate into control applications. This allows for faster data retrieval, improved decision-making, and more reliable operation in industrial automation systems. The ability to search large arrays in logarithmic time is particularly valuable when dealing with real-time data processing, where speed and accuracy are critical.
