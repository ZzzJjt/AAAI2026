**R-I-S-E:**

ðŸŸ¥ R (Role) â€“ Your Role

You are a control systems engineer responsible for documenting and designing the I/O configuration of a feedwater control system in a steam-water cycle of a power plant. Your objective is to create a structured I/O list that will serve as a reference for both automation design and instrumentation integration.

â¸»

ðŸŸ© I (Input) â€“ What Youâ€™re Given

You are tasked with creating an I/O list for feedwater control in a steam-water cycle. The list must include:
	â€¢	Signal names
	â€¢	Signal tagnumber
	â€¢	Analog/Digital classification
	â€¢	Engineering units
	â€¢	Range of values
	â€¢	Setpoint values
	â€¢	P&ID reference numbers

â¸»

ðŸŸ§ S (Steps) â€“ How to Do It

	1.	Create a table with the required columns:
	â€¢	Signal Name
	â€¢	Signal Tag Number
	â€¢	Analog/Digital
	â€¢	Engineering Unit
	â€¢	Range
	â€¢	Setpoint
	â€¢	P&ID Reference
	2.	For each row, add the relevant signal from the feedwater control system:
	â€¢	Include signals such as drum level transmitters, feedwater control valves, flow transmitters, and pump status feedbacks.
	â€¢	Assign realistic tagnumbers and P&ID references based on the systemâ€™s layout.
	3.	Define the engineering units, ranges, and setpoints for each signal:
	â€¢	Use standard engineering units (e.g., meters, cubic meters per hour, psi, etc.).
	â€¢	Provide a practical range of values for each signal, ensuring it covers the operational limits of the equipment.
	â€¢	Include setpoint values where applicable, such as the target drum level or control valve position.
	4.	Organize the table in a logical order, such as by signal function or P&ID reference, to make it easy to reference during design and implementation.
