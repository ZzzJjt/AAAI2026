**Example:**

**Fermentation Process:**

Fermentation is a process used to produce penicillin, an antibiotic used to treat bacterial infections. The process involves several steps, including:

1.	Water Tank: A large tank is filled with water to provide a medium for the fermentation process.
2.	Nutrient Mixer: A mixer is used to combine nutrients, such as glucose and yeast extract, with the water to create a nutrient-rich medium for the bacteria to grow.
3.	Sterilizer: The nutrient-rich medium is sterilized to kill any unwanted bacteria or contaminants.
4.	Fermenter: The sterilized medium is then transferred to a fermenter, where the bacteria that produce penicillin are introduced. The fermenter is equipped with sensors to monitor parameters such as temperature, pH, and oxygen levels.
5.	Separator: Once the bacteria have produced enough penicillin, the mixture is transferred to a separator to remove the bacteria and other unwanted materials.
6.	Product Tank: The purified penicillin is then transferred to a product tank, where it is stored until it is ready to be used.

**Instrumentation:**

The fermentation process is controlled using a variety of instrumentation, including:

1.	Temperature Transmitters (TT): These sensors measure the temperature of the medium and send signals to a temperature controller.
2.	Temperature Controllers (TIC): These devices receive signals from the temperature transmitters and adjust the temperature of the medium by controlling the heating or cooling system.
3.	pH Probes: These sensors measure the pH of the medium and send signals to a pH controller.
4.	pH Controllers: These devices receive signals from the pH probes and adjust the pH of the medium by adding acid or base.
5.	Level Indicators: These sensors measure the level of the medium in the fermenter and send signals to a level controller.
6.	Flow Indicators: These sensors measure the flow rate of the medium in the fermenter and send signals to a flow controller.
7.	Dosing Pumps: These pumps are used to add nutrients or other chemicals to the medium as needed.

**Control Strategy:**

The fermentation process is controlled using a combination of manual and automatic control strategies.

1.	Manual Control: Some parameters, such as the addition of nutrients or the adjustment of the pH, may be controlled manually by the operator.
2.	Automatic Control: Other parameters, such as temperature and pH, are controlled automatically by PID control loops. These loops
