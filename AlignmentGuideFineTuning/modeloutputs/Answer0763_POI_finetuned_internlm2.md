	â€¢	A cyclically executing PLC program that:

**Fix the Traffic Light Control Logic:**

The provided traffic light control logic contains several issues that need to be addressed to ensure proper operation within a PLC scan cycle. The main issues are:

1.	**Blocking the Scan Cycle:** The program uses a WHILE TRUE DO loop, which can block the PLC scan cycle and cause delays in other tasks. This is not compliant with IEC 61131-3 standards.
2.	**Improper Timer Usage:** The timer is reinitialized within the same scan cycle, which can lead to unexpected behavior and delays. The timer should only be reinitialized when the light sequence changes.
3.	**Lack of a State Machine:** The program does not use a state machine to manage the traffic light sequence. This makes it difficult to ensure proper transitions and timing between the different light phases.
4.	**Incomplete Handling of Pedestrian Requests:** The program does not handle the pedestrian button press correctly. It should only respond to a rising edge (press) of the button and ensure that the pedestrian has enough time to cross before switching to the next light phase.
5.	**Incomplete Handling of Emergency Vehicle Requests:** The program does not handle emergency vehicle requests correctly. It should immediately switch to green for emergency vehicles, overriding other requests, and ensure that the light remains green until the emergency vehicle has passed.

To fix these issues, you should:

1.	Remove the WHILE TRUE DO loop and replace it with a cyclic scan cycle.
2.	Ensure that the timer is only reinitialized when the light sequence changes, using a rising edge (R_TRIG) for the pedestrian button.
3.	Implement a state machine to manage the traffic light sequence, with states for normal operation, pedestrian crossing, and emergency vehicle priority.
4.	Handle the pedestrian button press correctly, using a rising edge (R_TRIG) to detect the press and ensure that the pedestrian
