**Solution:**

```MATLAB
% MATLAB Distillation Column Modeling and Control

% Define the system parameters
L = 10; % distillation column length (m)
T = 100; % distillation column temperature (K)
rho = 1000; % feed density (kg/m^3)
rho_v = 800; % vapor density (kg/m^3)
rho_t = 1200; % liquid density (kg/m^3)
mu = 1000; % liquid viscosity (Pa*s)
mu_v = 1000; % vapor viscosity (Pa*s)
k = 1000; % heat transfer coefficient (W/(m*K))

% Define the system states
x = [rho(1:L), T(1:L)]; % state vector
u = [0, 0]; % control input (feed rate and temperature)

% Define the system dynamics
A = [rho(1:L) 0; 0 1]; % state matrix
B = [0 0; 1 0]; % input matrix
C = [0 0; 0 1]; % output matrix
D = [1 0; 0 1]; % state transition matrix

% Define the system dynamics
f = @(t,x,u) [0, 0; 0, 1];

% Define the system constraints
x_min = [100, 100];
x_max = [200, 200];

% Define the MPC logic
N = 100; % number of time steps
T = 10; % prediction horizon
K = 10; % control gain

% Implement the MPC logic
u_mpc = zeros(N, 2);
for i = 1:N
    % Predict the system states
    x_pred = x + D * (T - 1) * u;
    x_min_pred = min(x_min, x_pred);
    x_max_pred = max(x_max, x_pred);

    % Compute the costate
    P = A * D * (T - 1) *
