### Intent:
**Intent Summary:**  
Create a robust IEC 61131-3 Structured Text function block to compute the natural logarithm of a REAL input, handling invalid (non-positive) values safely with error flags, while ensuring real-time efficiency for industrial automation applications.

### Prompt:
**Natural Logarithm:**

Develop a self-contained function block in IEC 61131-3 Structured Text to compute the natural logarithm of a given input. Ensure that the implementation is efficient and well-documented, with comments explaining the mathematical foundation of the natural logarithm. Additionally, address potential edge cases, such as handling non-positive inputs, and discuss the precision and performance of this function block in typical industrial applications.

**R-I-S-E:**

🟥 R (Role) – Your Role

You are a PLC software developer or control systems engineer responsible for implementing mathematical functions in IEC 61131-3 Structured Text for use in real-time industrial automation systems. Your goal is to ensure both computational correctness and system safety when executing advanced mathematical operations.

⸻

🟩 I (Input) – What You’re Given

You are required to implement a function block that:
	•	Computes the natural logarithm of a single input value
	•	Accepts an input:
X : REAL – a value for which ln(X) is to be calculated
	•	Outputs:
	•	LnX : REAL – the natural logarithm of X
	•	Error : BOOL – indicates whether the input is out of domain (i.e., X ≤ 0)
	•	Must handle edge cases like X = 0 or negative values safely
	•	Needs to run efficiently within the scan-time limits of a PLC
	•	May use the built-in LN() function or implement a fallback approximation if necessary

⸻

🟧 S (Steps) – What You Need to Do
	1.	Create a function block named NaturalLog:
 FUNCTION_BLOCK NaturalLog
VAR_INPUT
    X : REAL;
END_VAR
VAR_OUTPUT
    LnX : REAL;
    Error : BOOL;
END_VAR
	2.	Implement logic for computing the logarithm:
	•	If X > 0, use LN(X) and set Error := FALSE
	•	If X ≤ 0, return a default value (0.0 or -9999.0) and set Error := TRUE
	•	Optionally include a diagnostic log or fault code for error tracking
	3.	Comment clearly on:
	•	Why ln(x) is undefined for non-positive values
	•	The mathematical relationship between logarithms and exponentials
	•	Real-time implications of using a built-in vs. custom implementation
	4.	Optimize for execution:
	•	Use straight-line logic (no loops or recursion)
	•	Ensure that the logic fits within standard scan times
	•	Validate with test cases for edge inputs like 0.0001, 1, 1000, and -5

⸻

🟦 E (Expectation) – What Success Looks Like

You produce a robust and reusable function block that:
	•	Correctly calculates the natural logarithm for valid inputs
	•	Handles domain errors gracefully and safely
	•	Provides diagnostic feedback without crashing the control program
	•	Is lightweight, readable, and suitable for real-time use in industrial applications such as:
	•	Sensor calibration
	•	Flow and pressure linearization
	•	Exponential decay modeling
