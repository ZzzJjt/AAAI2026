**B-A-B:**

Before

You are working on a PLC-based control system that requires trigonometric calculations, such as waveform generation or oscillatory control. However, the built-in trigonometric functions are either not available or too slow for real-time execution.

After

You have developed a self-contained function block in IEC 61131-3 Structured Text that efficiently computes the sine of an angle in radians. The function block is modular, reusable, and includes detailed comments explaining the mathematical operations involved. It is designed to execute deterministically and is suitable for use in real-time PLC applications.

Behavior

The function block receives an angle in radians as input and returns the sine of that angle. It is based on either a built-in SIN() function or a mathematical series approximation, ensuring accuracy within the specified input range. The implementation is optimized for PLC platforms, avoiding recursion or dynamic memory usage to ensure real-time performance.

Discuss the precision of the sine function within the context of PLC programming, including potential limitations in real-time applications, and highlight the advantages of using radians for trigonometric calculations in control systems.
