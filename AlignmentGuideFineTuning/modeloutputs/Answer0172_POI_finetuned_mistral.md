### Intent:
**Intent Summary:**  
Create a reusable IEC 61131-3 structured text function block for an iterative quicksort algorithm that sorts integer arrays in PLC environments, featuring stack-based emulation, input validation, and state-machine-driven execution for safe, efficient sorting within industrial automation systems.

### Prompt:
**Counter:**
Implement a self-contained function block in IEC 61131-3 structured text for a digital counter with up/down counting modes. Include configurable initial value, step size, and overflow handling.

**B-A-B:**

ðŸŸ¥ B (Before) â€“ The Problem or Challenge

Digital counters are essential in industrial automation for tracking events, cycles, or product quantities. However, basic counters often lack flexibilityâ€”such as configurable counting direction, custom step sizes, and overflow protection. Without a robust and reusable function block, engineers may struggle to maintain or scale these functions in complex control systems.

â¸»

ðŸŸ© A (After) â€“ The Desired Outcome

Design and implement a self-contained IEC 61131-3 Structured Text function block that performs as a flexible digital counter, supporting:
	â€¢	Up/down counting modes
	â€¢	A configurable initial value
	â€¢	A customizable step size
	â€¢	Overflow and underflow handling
This function block should be modular, reusable, and safe for use in scan-cycle-driven PLC environments.

ðŸŸ§ B (Bridge) â€“ How to Get There
	1.	Define the function block with inputs:
	â€¢	Enable : BOOL
	â€¢	CountUp : BOOL
	â€¢	StepSize : INT
	â€¢	InitValue : INT
	â€¢	Reset : BOOL
	â€¢	MaxValue : INT
	â€¢	MinValue : INT
	2.	Use internal variables to store the current count and handle direction logic:
	â€¢	Increment or decrement based on CountUp and Enable
	â€¢	Reset counter when Reset = TRUE
	â€¢	Clamp the value between MinValue and MaxValue to prevent overflow/underflow
	3.	Output the result as CurrentValue : INT and status flags like AtMax, AtMin.
	4.	Comment each section to make the block readable and easy to reuse across projects.
