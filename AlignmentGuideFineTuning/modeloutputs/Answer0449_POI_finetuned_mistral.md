### Intent:
The task involves creating a Structured Text function block to read and process diagnostic data from a Profibus DP slave device, including device status, error codes, and communication health, with proper error handling and status reporting.

### Prompt:
**Profibus DP Diagnostics Using 61131-3 Structured Text:**

Develop a self-contained 61131-3 structured text function block to read diagnostic data from a Profibus DP slave device. The function block should handle communication with the Profibus DP slave and retrieve diagnostic information such as device status, error codes, and communication health. Provide an explanation of the key steps in processing the diagnostic data, including request initiation, data retrieval, and error handling mechanisms.

**R-I-S-E:**

ðŸŸ¥ R (Role) â€“ Your Role

Act as a PLC programmer developing diagnostic and communication monitoring tools for Profibus DP networks using IEC 61131-3 Structured Text.

â¸»

ðŸŸ© I (Input) â€“ What Youâ€™re Given

You are tasked with creating a self-contained Structured Text (ST) function block that reads diagnostic data from a Profibus DP slave device. The function block must retrieve key information such as device status, error codes, and communication health, and expose execution status and error flags for use in control applications.

â¸»

ðŸŸ§ S (Steps) â€“ What You Need to Do
	1.	Define a function block interface with the following:
	â€¢	Inputs: Execute (BOOL), SlaveAddress (BYTE), Timeout (TIME)
	â€¢	Outputs: Done (BOOL), Busy (BOOL), Error (BOOL), ErrorID (DWORD), plus structured diagnostic outputs (e.g. DeviceStatus, CommState)
	2.	Inside the function block:
	â€¢	Detect rising edge of Execute to start the diagnostic read
	â€¢	Send a Profibus DP diagnostic request using the slave address
	â€¢	Wait for response and validate it within the given Timeout
	â€¢	Parse the response to extract error flags, status codes, and communication health indicators
	â€¢	Set output flags (Done, Error) and assign the parsed data to output variables
	3.	Implement internal error handling for timeouts, invalid responses, or communication loss. Provide ErrorID codes for troubleshooting.

ðŸŸ¦ E (Expectation) â€“ What Success Looks Like

The function block allows the PLC program to retrieve and react to real-time diagnostic data from any Profibus DP slave. Operators and maintenance systems gain early visibility into device issues, while control logic can trigger alarms or fallback procedures based on accurate status and error conditionsâ€”improving system uptime and maintainability.
