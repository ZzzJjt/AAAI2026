### Intent:
**Intent Summary:**  
Create an IEC 61131-3 Structured Text program to control a coffee machine with three tanks (coffee, milk, mixer) and valves, handling drink selection (coffee-only or coffee-milk), automated filling/mixing/dispensing cycles, and emergency stop functionality for safety.  

*(Key focus: State-based control, tank/valve logic, real-time safety, and drink mode flexibility.)*

### Prompt:
**Coffee Maker Control Using 61131-3 Structured Text:**

Write a self-contained 61131-3 structured text (ST) program to control a coffee machine that manages three tanks (coffee, milk, and mixer) and three valves (one for coffee, one for milk, and one for output). The machine should mix coffee and milk properly to create the best output, following this process:

System Description:

	1.	Tanks and Valves:
	â€¢	The coffee and milk valves open to fill the mixer tank. The mixer tank can hold up to 130ml, and when it reaches the maximum level, the coffee and milk valves will close.
	2.	Mixing Process:
	â€¢	Once the tank is full, the mixer starts automatically and runs for 4 seconds. After mixing is complete, the output valve opens to dispense the coffee.
	3.	Control Buttons:
	â€¢	Button 1: Emergency Stop â€” Stops the entire system instantly in case of malfunction, such as valve failures, tank level issues, or mixer failures.
	â€¢	Button 2: Start â€” Begins the coffee-making process.
	â€¢	Button 3: Coffee and Milk â€” Prepares coffee with milk by opening both the coffee and milk valves.
	â€¢	Button 4: Coffee Only â€” Prepares coffee without milk by only opening the coffee valve.

Safety Features:

	â€¢	Implement the emergency stop to handle unexpected events, such as valve malfunctions, tank level detection failures, or mixer operation failures. When triggered, the system should stop immediately to ensure safety.

**R-I-S-E:**

ðŸŸ¥ R (Role) â€“ Your Role

You are a PLC programmer responsible for implementing an automated control system for a coffee machine using IEC 61131-3 Structured Text (ST). Your task includes ensuring correct sequencing, drink selection, and emergency response handling for a system with tanks, valves, a mixer, and multiple operator buttons.

ðŸŸ© I (Input) â€“ What Youâ€™re Given

Your system consists of:
	â€¢	Three tanks:
	â€¢	Coffee tank
	â€¢	Milk tank
	â€¢	Mixer tank (max capacity: 130 ml)
	â€¢	Three valves:
	â€¢	CoffeeValve
	â€¢	MilkValve
	â€¢	OutputValve
	â€¢	One mixer motor:
	â€¢	Mixer (runs for 4 seconds)
	â€¢	Control buttons:
	â€¢	EmergencyStop â€” immediately halts all operations
	â€¢	Start â€” initiates the drink preparation process
	â€¢	CoffeeMilk â€” selects coffee with milk
	â€¢	CoffeeOnly â€” selects coffee without milk
	â€¢	Sensors:
	â€¢	MixerLevelFull â€” TRUE when the mixer is full
	â€¢	Optional: MixerFault or ValveError for emergency triggers

â¸»

ðŸŸ§ S (Steps) â€“ What You Need to Do
	1.	Monitor inputs and mode selections:
	â€¢	Start the process only if Start is pressed and a mode is selected (CoffeeMilk or CoffeeOnly)
	â€¢	Open the relevant valves (both or only coffee) to begin filling the mixer
	2.	Tank filling logic:
	â€¢	Keep valves open until MixerLevelFull is TRUE
	â€¢	Once full, close all input valves and start the Mixer motor
	3.	Mixing and dispensing:
	â€¢	Run the mixer for 4 seconds (use TON timer)
	â€¢	Once mixing is complete, stop the mixer and open the OutputValve to dispense the coffee
	4.	Handle safety and emergency conditions:
	â€¢	At any time, if EmergencyStop = TRUE, immediately stop all components:
	â€¢	Set CoffeeValve, MilkValve, OutputValve, Mixer = FALSE
	â€¢	Reset state machine to IDLE
	â€¢	Optionally trigger alarms or status indicators

â¸»

ðŸŸ¦ E (Expectation) â€“ What Success Looks Like

You produce a structured, reliable, and real-time capable control program that:
	â€¢	Handles two drink modes (coffee-only and coffee with milk)
	â€¢	Executes the fill â†’ mix â†’ dispense cycle based on tank levels and timers
	â€¢	Supports a fully responsive Emergency Stop that halts and resets the machine safely
	â€¢	Can be integrated with an HMI or expanded with diagnostics for valve/mixer faults
	â€¢	Follows IEC 61131-3 best practices, with clear state management, fail-safe logic, and modular readability
