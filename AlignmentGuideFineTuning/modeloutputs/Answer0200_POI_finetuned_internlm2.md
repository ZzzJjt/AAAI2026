### Intent:
**Intent Summary:**  
Design an automated control system for ethanol fermentation that regulates temperature (34Â°C Â±1Â°C), pH (5.0 Â±0.2), agitation (90 RPM Â±10), and sterilization, with safety interlocks and alarms, to maximize yield and ensure process stability.  

*(Focus: PLC/DCS implementation with PID loops, setpoints, and fault handling for fermentation.)*

### Prompt:
**SFC Traffic Light:**

Create a 61131-3 sequential function chart in ASCII art for a traffic light. Include proper delays for switching the lights.

**B-A-B:**

ðŸŸ¥ B (Before) â€“ The Problem or Challenge

When designing a traffic light control system using IEC 61131-3, itâ€™s important to clearly represent the sequential logic of light transitions (green â†’ yellow â†’ red â†’ green) with appropriate timing delays. In situations where graphical tools are not availableâ€”such as for documentation, version control, or early-stage logic planningâ€”engineers need a way to express Sequential Function Charts (SFCs) using plain-text or ASCII art. Without a structured textual layout, the sequence flow and timing logic can become confusing or miscommunicated.

â¸»

ðŸŸ© A (After) â€“ The Desired Outcome

Create a Sequential Function Chart (SFC) in ASCII art that models the behavior of a standard traffic light system. The chart should:
	â€¢	Follow IEC 61131-3 syntax and logic structure
	â€¢	Include steps for Green, Yellow, and Red lights
	â€¢	Use transitions between steps with clear conditions
	â€¢	Implement delays/timers between transitions (e.g., 5s green, 2s yellow, 5s red)
	â€¢	Be clearly formatted to show the flow from one step to the next in a loop

ðŸŸ§ B (Bridge) â€“ How to Get There
	1.	Define three steps: S1: Green, S2: Yellow, S3: Red
	2.	Place transitions between steps with timing conditions such as T#5s or tGreen.Q
	3.	Format the diagram using ASCII blocks for clarity, for example:

 +------------+     tGreen.Q     +-------------+     tYellow.Q     +-----------+
| Green Light|---------------->| Yellow Light|------------------>| Red Light |
|  TON: tGreen                  |  TON: tYellow                 |  TON: tRed |
+------------+                 +-------------+                 +-----------+
        ^                                                                 |
        |                                                                 |
        +-----------------------------------------------------------------+
                         tRed.Q (after 5s)

	4.	Ensure the transitions are self-contained and can be executed independently
	5.	Include a loop to continuously cycle through the steps, ensuring the transitions are properly timed
	6.	Use ASCII art to represent the flow of the traffic light system, with clear delineation of each step and transition
	7.	Ensure the timing is accurate and the transitions are self-contained, so the system can be implemented in a PLC or other control system

**âž¤ IEC 61131-3 SFC Traffic Light:**

Create a self-contained IEC 61131-3 sequential function chart (SFC) in ASCII art to model the behavior of a traffic light system. The SFC should include three steps (Green, Yellow, and Red) with transitions between them, including timing conditions and delays. Use ASCII art to represent the flow of the traffic light system, ensuring that each step and transition is clearly defined and self-contained. Focus on the logic and timing of the traffic light system, rather than the physical implementation of the traffic light itself.
