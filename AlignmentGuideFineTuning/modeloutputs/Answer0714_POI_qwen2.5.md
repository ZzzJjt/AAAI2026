### Intent:
**Intent Summary:**  
Develop an IEC 61131-3 Structured Text function block to retrieve and process Ethernet PowerLink diagnostic data (communication status, error codes, node health) from a Managing Node, with cyclic polling, error handling, and structured outputs for network monitoring.  

*(Key focus: Diagnostic retrieval, real-time monitoring, and error handling for PowerLink networks.)*

### Prompt:
**Ethernet PowerLink Diagnostics Using IEC 61131-3 Structured Text:**

Develop a function block in structured text (ST) based on IEC 61131 standards to retrieve Ethernet PowerLink diagnostic information from a control node device via a PowerLink managing node (MN). The function block should collect and display key diagnostic data such as communication status, error codes, and node health. The program must ensure that the diagnostic information is accurately processed and relayed to the controller for further analysis. Discuss how the function block interacts with the PowerLink network, handles error detection, and provides real-time diagnostics for maintaining network integrity.

**R-T-F:**

ðŸŸ¥ R (Role) â€“ Your Role

Act as a PLC programmer developing diagnostic communication tools in IEC 61131-3 Structured Text for Ethernet PowerLink networks.

ðŸŸ© T (Task) â€“ What You Need to Do

Create a Structured Text (ST) function block that retrieves diagnostic data from Ethernet PowerLink control nodes via a Managing Node (MN). The block should collect communication status, error codes, and node health indicators. It must run cyclically, process diagnostic information accurately, and provide structured outputs to the controller for monitoring and logging. Error detection and handling must also be implemented to ensure reliable operation.

ðŸŸ§ F (Format) â€“ Expected Output

Deliver an IEC 61131-3 compliant function block that includes:
	â€¢	Inputs: node address, request trigger, enable/disable control
	â€¢	Outputs: communication status, error code, node health status
	â€¢	Internal logic for polling diagnostic data from the MN
	â€¢	Error handling for failed or missing responses
	â€¢	Structured and commented code for maintainability and integration into control systems

**Function Block Design:**

```structuredtext
FUNCTION_BLOCK EthernetPowerLinkDiagnostic
VAR_INPUT
    NodeAddress : INT; // Address of the control node
    RequestTrigger : BOOL; // Trigger for initiating diagnostic request
    EnableDisable : BOOL; // Enable/disable the diagnostic function
END_VAR

VAR_OUTPUT
    CommunicationStatus : BOOL; // True if communication is active
    ErrorCode : INT; // Error code from the control node
    NodeHealth : BOOL; // True if the node is healthy
END_VAR

VAR
    DiagnosticData : ARRAY[1..3] OF INT; // Placeholder for diagnostic data
    LastRequestTime : TIME; // Time of the last diagnostic request
    RequestInterval : TIME := T#1000ms; // Default request interval
    ErrorDetected : BOOL := FALSE; // Flag for error detection
END_VAR

METHODS
    Initialize : VOID
    BEGIN
        // Initialize variables and set up initial conditions
        DiagnosticData := [0, 0, 0];
        LastRequestTime := T#0;
        ErrorDetected := FALSE;
    END_METHOD

    ProcessDiagnosticData : VOID
    BEGIN
        // Process the diagnostic data from the control node
        // Update CommunicationStatus, ErrorCode, and NodeHealth
    END_METHOD

    PollDiagnosticData : VOID
    BEGIN
        // Poll the control node for diagnostic data
        // Use RequestTrigger and RequestInterval to control polling
    END_METHOD

    HandleErrors : VOID
    BEGIN
        // Check for errors in the diagnostic data
        // Set ErrorDetected flag if an error is detected
    END_METHOD

    UpdateOutputs : VOID
    BEGIN
        // Update the function block outputs based on the processed data
    END_METHOD
END_FUNCTION_BLOCK
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Initialization**: The `Initialize` method sets up the initial conditions for the function block, including initializing the diagnostic data array and setting the last request time to zero.

2. **ProcessDiagnosticData**: This method processes the diagnostic data received from the control node. It updates the `CommunicationStatus`, `ErrorCode`, and `NodeHealth` outputs based on the data received.

3. **PollDiagnosticData**: This method polls the control node for diagnostic data. It uses the `RequestTrigger` input to determine when to initiate a request and the `RequestInterval` to control the frequency of requests.

4. **HandleErrors**: This method checks for
