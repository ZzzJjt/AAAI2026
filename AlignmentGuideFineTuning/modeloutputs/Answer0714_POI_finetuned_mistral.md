### Intent:
**Intent Summary:**  
Develop an IEC 61131-3 Structured Text function block to retrieve and process Ethernet PowerLink diagnostic data (communication status, error codes, node health) from a Managing Node, with cyclic polling, error handling, and structured outputs for network monitoring.  

*(Key focus: Diagnostic retrieval, real-time monitoring, and error handling for PowerLink networks.)*

### Prompt:
**Ethernet PowerLink Diagnostics Using IEC 61131-3 Structured Text:**

Develop a function block in structured text (ST) based on IEC 61131 standards to retrieve Ethernet PowerLink diagnostic information from a control node device via a PowerLink managing node (MN). The function block should collect and display key diagnostic data such as communication status, error codes, and node health. The program must ensure that the diagnostic information is accurately processed and relayed to the controller for further analysis. Discuss how the function block interacts with the PowerLink network, handles error detection, and provides real-time diagnostics for maintaining network integrity.

**R-T-F:**

ðŸŸ¥ R (Role) â€“ Your Role

Act as a PLC programmer developing diagnostic communication tools in IEC 61131-3 Structured Text for Ethernet PowerLink networks.

ðŸŸ© T (Task) â€“ What You Need to Do

Create a Structured Text (ST) function block that retrieves diagnostic data from Ethernet PowerLink control nodes via a Managing Node (MN). The block should collect communication status, error codes, and node health indicators. It must run cyclically, process diagnostic information accurately, and provide structured outputs to the controller for monitoring and logging. Error detection and handling must also be implemented to ensure reliable operation.

ðŸŸ§ F (Format) â€“ Expected Output

Deliver an IEC 61131-3 compliant function block that includes:
	â€¢	Inputs: node address, request trigger, enable/disable control
	â€¢	Outputs: communication status, error code, node health status
	â€¢	Internal logic for polling diagnostic data from the MN
	â€¢	Error handling for failed or missing responses
	â€¢	Structured and commented code for maintainability and integration into control systems
