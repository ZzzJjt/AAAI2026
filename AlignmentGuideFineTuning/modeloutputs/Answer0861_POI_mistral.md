ðŸŸ¦ G (Goal) â€“ What You Want to Achieve

Provide a reliable, reusable function block that enables on-PLC eigenvalue computation, suitable for advanced process control, vibration analysis, or model validation. The solution should be engineered for stability, efficiency, and clarity, even within the resource constraints typical of real-time PLC environments.

**Challenges:**

1.	Numerical stability: The Power Method and QR algorithm may suffer from numerical instability when dealing with ill-conditioned matrices or small-scale computations. This can lead to inaccurate results or even crashes.
2.	Convergence: The iterative nature of these methods may not always guarantee convergence, especially for matrices with multiple close eigenvalues or when the initial guess is far from the actual eigenvector.
3.	Computational efficiency: Real-time applications require efficient algorithms to minimize the impact on the PLC's processing power and response time.
4.	Robustness: The function block should be able to handle various input matrices, including those with non-standard forms or singularities.
5.	Modularity: The function block should be designed to be easily integrated into existing control systems and reusable across different applications.

**Notes:**

1.	Consider using a QR algorithm with shift-and-invert (QRSI) or divide-and-conquer (QRDC) variants for improved stability and convergence.
2.	Implementing a Jacobi or Householder transformation can help reduce the computational complexity of the QR algorithm.
3.	Use a well-tested library or open-source implementation as a starting point to ensure accuracy and robustness.
4.	Consider using a fixed-point arithmetic or other numerical techniques to improve precision and stability in the PLC environment.
5.	Perform extensive testing with various input matrices to validate the function block's performance and robustness.
6.	Document the function block thoroughly, including its assumptions, limitations, and best practices for usage.
7.	Consider implementing a user-friendly interface for input matrix manipulation and output eigenvalue visualization.
8.	Optimize the function block for the specific PLC platform and hardware to ensure optimal performance.
9.	Consider implementing a multi-threaded or parallelized version of the algorithm for improved performance on multi-core PLCs.
10.	Consider implementing a function block for smaller matrix sizes (e.g., 3x3, 4x4, 5x5) to cater to a wider range of applications.
