	â€¢	A complete control narrative for the beer brewing process, including specific setpoints and acceptable ranges for each key parameter
	â€¢	A detailed explanation of the Lautering process (Section 4) that includes:
	â€¢	Required equipment and instrumentation
	â€¢	A step-by-step operational sequence
	â€¢	Key control logic or conditions (e.g., turbidity cutoff, flow thresholds)

â¸»

ðŸŸ§ S (Steps) â€“ Steps to Perform
	1.	Outline the full beer brewing process, including stages such as mashing, lautering, boiling, fermentation, and packaging
	â€¢	Provide concrete control values (e.g., mash temp = 65â€“68â€¯Â°C, sparge water temp = 75â€“78â€¯Â°C)
	2.	For Section 4: Lautering, include:
	â€¢	Equipment: lauter tun, rake mechanism, sparge arm, pump
	â€¢	Instrumentation: level sensor, turbidity meter, flow transmitter, temperature probe
	â€¢	Control Steps:
	1.	Start recirculation loop
	2.	Monitor turbidity; continue until it drops below threshold
	3.	Begin wort transfer to kettle
	4.	Start sparge water flow while maintaining level
	5.	Monitor volume, flow rate, and turbidity
	6.	End lautering once volume is met and wort clarity is acceptable
	3.	Include logical triggers like:
	â€¢	IF Turbidity > Limit THEN divert flow to waste
	â€¢	IF Level < Minimum THEN stop sparge water

ðŸŸ¦ E (Expectation) â€“ Expected Outcome

Produce a clear, structured control narrative that:
	â€¢	Defines measurable control criteria for brewing stages
	â€¢	Provides operators and automation engineers with step-by-step lautering logic
	â€¢	Enhances reliability and repeatability of the brewing process
	â€¢	Facilitates easy integration into PLC/HMI systems and operator training materials

**Control Narrative Beer Brewing:**

1.	Outline the full beer brewing process, including stages such as mashing, lautering, boiling, fermentation, and packaging.
	* Mashing: Mash temperature = 65â€“68â€¯Â°C, hold time = 60â€“90 minutes
	* Lautering: Sparge water temp = 75â€“78â€¯Â°C, wort turbidity = 1â€“5 NTU, wort volume = 50â€“60% of mash volume
	* Boiling: Hold time = 60â€“90 minutes, target temperature = 162â€“168â€¯Â°C
	* Fermentation: Temperature range = 10â€“20â€¯Â°C, hold time = 7â€“14 days
	* Packaging: Temperature = 4â€“10â€¯Â°C, pressure = 2â€“3 bars
2.	For Section 4: Lautering, include:
	* Equipment:
		+ Lauter tun
		+ Rake mechanism
		+ Sparge arm
		+ Pump
	* Instrumentation:
		+ Level sensor
		+ Turbidity meter
		+ Flow transmitter
		+ Temperature probe
	* Control Steps:
	1.	Start recirculation loop
	2.	Monitor turbidity; continue until it drops below threshold (e.g., 5 NTU)
	3.	Begin wort transfer to kettle
	4.	Start sparge water flow while maintaining level
	5.	Monitor volume, flow rate, and turbidity
	6.	End lautering once volume is met and wort clarity is acceptable (e.g., 80% of mash volume)
3.	Include logical triggers like:
	â€¢	IF Turbidity > Limit THEN divert flow to waste
	â€¢	IF Level < Minimum THEN stop sparge water

By implementing this control narrative, you will enhance the reliability and repeatability of the beer brewing process, making it easier to integrate into PLC/HMI systems and operator training materials.
