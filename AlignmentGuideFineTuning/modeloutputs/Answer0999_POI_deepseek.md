### Intent:
**Intent Summary:**  
Create a NORSOK-compliant textual System Control Diagram (SCD) for an LNG vaporizer system, detailing process flow, instrumentation (tagged per ISA-5.1), control loops (e.g., FT201 â†’ FIC201 â†’ FCV201), and safety interlocks (e.g., PSH301 â†’ ESD1), structured for design, HAZOP, and NORSOK I-005 compliance.  

*(Focused on LNG vaporizer control logic, instrumentation, and safety systems in standardized notation.)*

### Prompt:
**SCD LNG Vaporizer:**

Create a NORSOK system control diagram (SCD) in textual notation for a LNG Vaporizer System. Include instrumentation, control loops, and interlocks. Provide concrete tag numbers and piping.


**T-A-G:**

ðŸŸ¥ T (Task)

Develop a NORSOK-compliant System Control Diagram (SCD) in textual notation for an LNG vaporizer system.

â¸»

ðŸŸ© A (Action)
	â€¢	Outline the full process flow from LNG inlet to gas outlet using arrows (-->) to indicate direction.
	â€¢	Include all relevant instrumentation and control loops, such as:
	â€¢	Flow control loop: FT201 â†’ FIC201 â†’ FCV201
	â€¢	Temperature control loop: TT101 â†’ TIC101 â†’ TCV101
	â€¢	Add interlocks for critical conditions like overpressure and overtemperature, e.g.:
	â€¢	PSH301 â†’ ESD1 (Shut Heater Steam)
	â€¢	TSH302 â†’ ESD2 (Block LNG Inlet)
	â€¢	Assign realistic tag numbers to all instruments and final control elements.
	â€¢	Organize the text into clear sections for process flow, control loops, and safety logic.

ðŸŸ¦ G (Goal)

Produce a structured and readable textual SCD that reflects the control philosophy, instrumentation layout, and safety systems of the LNG vaporizer processâ€”serving as a reference for control system design, HAZOP studies, and compliance with NORSOK I-005 standards.
