### Intent:
**Intent Summary:**  
Create a structured state machine in IEC 61131-3 ST to automate a multi-step polyethylene batch process, managing temperature/pressure setpoints and timed transitions between stages (raw material prep to packaging) with safety fallbacks and modular logic.

### Prompt:
**List Mathematical Function Blocks:**
Compile a detailed list of all mathematical function blocks available in the OSCAT library for PLC programming, including a brief description of their functionality and typical use cases.

**B-A-B:**

ðŸŸ¥ Before â€“ The Starting Point

You are working with PLC programming in industrial automation and using the OSCAT (Open Source Community for Automation Technology) library. While the OSCAT library is known for its rich collection of function blocks, there is no centralized or detailed reference listing all the mathematical function blocks with descriptions and examples of how and when to use them.

â¸»

ðŸŸ© After â€“ The Desired Outcome

Create a comprehensive list of all mathematical function blocks available in the OSCAT library, each with:
	â€¢	A short description of what the function block does
	â€¢	The typical use cases or scenarios where itâ€™s applied
	â€¢	(Optional) Notes on parameter types, ranges, or limitations

This list will serve as a quick reference for control engineers and developers integrating advanced math operations in their automation projects.

â¸»

ðŸŸ¦ Bridge â€“ How to Get There

To create this list:
	1.	Extract all mathematical function blocks from the OSCAT documentation or source.
	2.	For each block:
	â€¢	Record the name
	â€¢	Write a one-line description (e.g., calculates sine, logarithm, RMS, etc.)
	â€¢	Note where it is typically used (e.g., PID loops, filtering, analytics, etc.)
	3.	Organize them into categories (e.g., trigonometry, statistics, algebraic functions)
	4.	Present in a readable format (e.g., table or markdown list)

**C-A-R-E:**

ðŸŸ¥ C (Context) â€“ The Situation

In industrial automation, PLCs often require complex mathematical operations to control processes, monitor signals, and perform data analysis. The OSCAT library provides a wide range of function blocks for these tasks, but there is no consolidated reference to help users quickly identify and understand the available mathematical operations.

ðŸŸ© A (Action) â€“ What You Did

To address this gap, you created a comprehensive list of all mathematical function blocks in the OSCAT library, including their names, descriptions, and typical use cases. You organized the list into categories for easy reference and presented it in a clear and concise format.

ðŸŸ§ R (Result) â€“ The Output or Product

Your list provides a valuable resource for control engineers and developers working with PLCs, enabling them to quickly identify the mathematical operations they need and understand how to apply them in their automation projects.

ðŸŸ© I (Impact) â€“ How It Matters

By providing a comprehensive and organized reference for mathematical function blocks in the OSCAT library, you help streamline the process of integrating advanced math operations into PLC programming. This can lead to more efficient and accurate automation systems, as well as better data analysis and control in industrial applications.
