### Intent:
**Intent Summary:**  
Develop a Python-based fuzzy logic control system to regulate temperature and pressure in a chemical reactor, using `skfuzzy` to handle nonlinear dynamics and disturbances, and visualize the control response.

### Prompt:
**Artificial Neural Network Control for Temperature Regulation in a Chemical Reactor Using Python:**

**Origin**

Develop Python code to implement an artificial neural network (ANN) for advanced process control of the temperature in a chemical reactor. The control system should leverage the predictive and adaptive capabilities of ANNs to manage the reactorâ€™s temperature, considering the nonlinear and time-varying nature of the reactorâ€™s dynamics. Train the ANN using historical process data to optimize temperature control, ensuring stability and efficiency under varying operational conditions.

Implement Python code to simulate the chemical reactorâ€™s temperature control dynamics and demonstrate how ANN-based control can outperform traditional methods in handling complex, nonlinear systems.

**C-A-R-E**

ðŸŸ¥ Cï¼ˆContextï¼‰

In chemical process industries, temperature control of reactors is critical. However, due to the nonlinear and time-varying nature of reactor dynamics, traditional PID controllers often fall short in maintaining optimal performance.

ðŸŸ© Aï¼ˆActionï¼‰

Develop Python code to implement an artificial neural network (ANN)-based advanced process control system. Train the ANN using historical process data to predict and adjust temperature more effectively than conventional methods. Also, simulate the reactorâ€™s temperature dynamics to validate control performance.

ðŸŸ¨ Rï¼ˆResultï¼‰

The ANN controller should demonstrate superior adaptability and predictive accuracy, resulting in more stable temperature control, improved energy efficiency, and reduced oscillations compared to traditional PID-based approaches.

ðŸŸ¦ Eï¼ˆExampleï¼‰

For instance, simulate a scenario where the reactor experiences a sudden change in feed temperature. Show how the ANN anticipates and adjusts the control signal smoothly, while the PID controller lags or causes instability.
