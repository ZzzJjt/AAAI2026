### Intent:
The task involves creating a Modbus TCP server function block in IEC 61131-3 Structured Text to handle multiple client connections, process standard Modbus requests (read/write coils/registers), and manage communication with proper error handling and response generation.

### Prompt:
**Profibus DP Diagnostics Using 61131-3 Structured Text:**

Develop a self-contained 61131-3 structured text function block to read diagnostic data from a Profibus DP slave device. The function block should handle communication with the Profibus DP slave and retrieve diagnostic information such as device status, error codes, and communication health. Provide an explanation of the key steps in processing the diagnostic data, including request initiation, data retrieval, and error handling mechanisms.

**C-A-R-E:**

ðŸŸ¥ C (Context) â€“ The Background

Profibus DP is a widely used fieldbus protocol in industrial automation, enabling fast communication between PLCs and field devices. However, accessing diagnostic information from Profibus DP slave devices is not always straightforward, especially when real-time status monitoring and structured error handling are needed inside IEC 61131-3 control logic.

â¸»

ðŸŸ© A (Action) â€“ The Implementation Task

Develop a self-contained IEC 61131-3 Structured Text (ST) function block that reads diagnostic data from a Profibus DP slave. The function block should:
	â€¢	Communicate with the Profibus DP network to request diagnostic data
	â€¢	Retrieve and decode relevant information such as device status, error codes, and communication health
	â€¢	Provide execution control inputs (e.g., Execute) and structured outputs including Done, Error, and ErrorID
	â€¢	Include logic for timeout detection, error flagging, and retry mechanisms for reliability

The block should be cyclically callable and suitable for integration into process monitoring or fault-handling routines.

â¸»

ðŸŸ¨ R (Result) â€“ The Expected Outcome

The resulting function block enables PLC applications to monitor the health of Profibus DP slave devices in real time. It improves visibility into field-level diagnostics, facilitates predictive maintenance, and supports faster troubleshooting by exposing meaningful fault and status codes directly in the control logic.

â¸»

ðŸŸ¦ E (Example) â€“ A Practical Use Case

For instance, a PLC uses the function block to query a Profibus DP temperature transmitter. Upon execution, the block reads the diagnostic buffer and finds a CRC error code indicating intermittent communication failure. The function block sets Error := TRUE, populates ErrorID with the fault code, and leaves Done := FALSE. The main PLC program can then log the issue, notify maintenance, or switch to a backup sensor path.

ðŸŸ¦ E (Explanation) â€“ Key Steps in Processing Diagnostic Data

1. Initialize variables:
	* Profibus DP connection handle (e.g., PB_Connection)
	* Diagnostic data buffer (e.g., DiagData)
	* Error flag (e.g., Error)
	* Error ID (e.g., ErrorID)
	* Timeout counter (e.g., TimeoutCounter)
2. Request diagnostic data:
	* Set the Profibus DP diagnostic request (e.g., PB_RequestDiag)
	* Write the request to the Profibus DP connection (e.g., PB_WriteRequest)
3. Wait for response:
	* Check if the response is available (e.g., PB_IsResponseAvailable)
	* If not, increment TimeoutCounter and check if it exceeds the maximum allowed time (e.g., TimeoutCounter > MaxTimeout)
4. Read and decode diagnostic data:
	* Read the response from the Profibus DP connection (e.g., PB_ReadResponse)
	* Parse the diagnostic data buffer (e.g., DiagData) to extract relevant information (e.g., device status, error codes, communication health)
5. Handle errors:
	* If CRC or other errors are detected, set Error := TRUE and populate ErrorID with the fault code
	* If TimeoutCounter exceeds the maximum allowed time, set Error := TRUE and populate ErrorID with a timeout error code
6. Set Done flag:
	* If no errors occurred, set Done := TRUE
7. Return control to the calling program
