### Intent:
**Intent Summary:**  
Create a reusable IEC 61131-3 Structured Text function block for a configurable timer with start/stop controls, elapsed/remaining time tracking, and timeout handling for industrial automation applications.

### Prompt:
**Timer:**
Implement a self-contained function block in IEC 61131-3 structured text to create a timer. Include configurable time duration, start/stop controls, and timeout handling.


**C-A-R-E:**

ğŸŸ¥ C (Context) â€“ Background Situation

Timers are fundamental building blocks in PLC programming, used for delays, sequencing, and interlock conditions. However, many standard timers are rigid or lack modular control logic, making it difficult to customize behavior such as dynamically changing durations or adding start/stop logic. For reusable automation code, a flexible and configurable Structured Text timer block is preferred.

ğŸŸ© A (Action) â€“ Task to Perform

Design a self-contained timer function block in IEC 61131-3 Structured Text that includes:
	â€¢	Configurable time duration via PresetTime : TIME
	â€¢	Start and Stop inputs to control execution dynamically
	â€¢	Elapsed time tracking with a built-in timeout mechanism
	â€¢	Internal logic to handle rising-edge detection and accurate scan-cycle timing
	â€¢	Output flags including:
	â€¢	Running : BOOL â€“ TRUE when counting
	â€¢	Done : BOOL â€“ TRUE when the timer completes
	â€¢	Optionally, RemainingTime : TIME

â¸»

ğŸŸ¨ R (Result) â€“ Expected Outcome

The outcome will be a modular, reusable timer block that:
	â€¢	Integrates cleanly into any PLC program requiring timing functionality
	â€¢	Enables dynamic control with start/stop inputs
	â€¢	Offers scan-cycle accuracy and proper handling of timer overflow
	â€¢	Can be used across a wide range of automation tasks (e.g., heating cycles, alarms, delays)

ğŸŸ¦ E (Example) â€“ Concrete Illustration

Simplified logic:

IF Start AND NOT Stop THEN
    IF NOT Running THEN
        StartTime := TIME(); // Capture current time
        Running := TRUE;
    END_IF;

    ElapsedTime := TIME() - StartTime;

    IF ElapsedTime >= PresetTime THEN
        Done := TRUE;
        Running := FALSE;
    END_IF;
ELSIF Stop THEN
    Running := FALSE;
    Done := FALSE;
    ElapsedTime := T#0s;
END_IF;

ğŸŸª A (Analysis) â€“ Decomposition into Smaller Steps

1.	Define the timer function block with inputs for start/stop control and preset time duration.
2.	Implement logic to handle start/stop transitions, ensuring that the timer only starts counting when both conditions are met.
3.	Track elapsed time by subtracting the start time from the current time.
4.	Include a timeout mechanism to set a maximum duration for the timer, triggering a done flag when the elapsed time exceeds the preset value.
5.	Ensure that the timer logic is self-contained, with no external dependencies, to promote reusability and ease of integration.
6.	Test the timer function block under various conditions, including start/stop transitions, timeouts, and edge cases, to validate its behavior and accuracy.

ğŸŸ« R (Rationale) â€“ Why Itâ€™s Done This Way

By creating a self-contained timer function block in IEC 61131-3 Structured Text, you can ensure that the timer logic is modular, reusable, and easily integrated into any PLC program. This approach allows for precise control over start/stop conditions, accurate elapsed time tracking, and configurable timeout handling, making it a versatile and reliable solution for timing-based automation tasks.
