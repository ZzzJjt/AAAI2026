### Intent:
**Intent Summary:**  
Develop a 6-DOF aircraft dynamics model in MATLAB to simulate flight behavior under control inputs (thrust, elevator, rudder) and wind disturbances, calculating forces, accelerations, and angular rates for trajectory tracking.  

*(Focused on code generation for simulating aircraft motion with aerodynamic effects and control inputs.)*

### Prompt:
**Model Predictive Control for HVAC System Optimization Using C++:**

Develop C++ code to implement a model predictive control (MPC) algorithm for optimizing the performance of a Heating, Ventilation, and Air Conditioning (HVAC) system. The control system should manage temperature, humidity, and energy consumption while maintaining occupant comfort. It must consider dynamic constraints such as varying external temperatures, occupancy levels, and energy efficiency requirements, ensuring optimal control under changing environmental conditions.

Implement C++ code to simulate the HVAC systemâ€™s dynamics, and demonstrate how MPC can optimize energy usage, response time, and system performance while adhering to operational constraints.
