# AAAI2026
Experiment Data of AAAI2026


### Model & Checkpoint Information

We fine-tuned several open-source models (e.g., Qwen1.5-7B, DeepSeek-7B) on our IC-100 dataset.  
The base models are available at:

- Qwen1.5-7B: https://huggingface.co/Qwen/Qwen1.5-7B
- DeepSeek-7B: https://huggingface.co/deepseek-ai/deepseek-llm-7b-base

Due to the large size of fine-tuned models (each >100GB), we do not include them directly.  
However, we provide all training scripts, configurations, and inference instructions.  
Fine-tuned checkpoints can be made available upon acceptance or request.
